此		this here				2201			シ	これ、 この、 ここ	I'm not going to use 'this here' as a primitive because it's too vague. But 'stop and sit down', usually tied to a tour guide explaining scenery works for me.//<em>Stop</em> and <em>sit down</em> to have a look at<strong> this here</strong>.	"A wildlife explorer, let's call him Steve Irwin, the sadly passed away wildlife expert, is tracking down an animal in a forest. He finds a <em>footprint</em>, and gets out a <em>spoon</em> to taste it. He scrapes the spoon over the floor and tries it. ""Now,<strong> this here</strong> is a crocodile footprint"" he announces."					RTK3
柴		brushwood				2202			サイ、 シ	しば	(From mantixen's) I'll <em>stop</em> and <em>sit down</em> on <em>this here tree</em>, which happens to be<strong> brushwood</strong>.

They never <em>stop and sit down</em> when the tour guide tells them to!	<em>Two</em>-year-olds don't have a<strong> whit</strong> of interest to <em>stop and sit down</em>. They'd likely explode with all that energy.					RTK3
砦		fort				2204			サイ	とりで	"<em>Stop and sit down</em> to listen to the tour guide's story. ""These <em>stones</em> down there used to be a<strong> fort</strong>, but the enemy came and tore the place down. It has never been rebuild""."

髭		beard				2205			シ	ひげ、 くちひげ	"""Please <em>stop and sit down</em> to look to the painting up there"", the tour guide says. ""We don't know exactly who is on the painting, but from the <em>shape</em> of the <em>hair</em> and the distinctive <em>beard</em>, we think they meant to depict President Lincoln."""	A<strong> beard</strong> is hair that, instead of wanting it SHAPED like your friends, you grow it LONG so that you can STOP, SIT DOWN and scratch it thoughtful while considering this here and that there.					RTK3
禽		fowl				2206			キン	とり、 とりこ	"The villain from <a href=""/study/kanji/%E9%9B%A2"">離</a> (<span class=""frnr"">#1492</span>) and <a href=""/study/kanji/%E7%92%83"">璃</a> (<span class=""frnr"">#2048</span>). Now, hidden under an <em>umbrella</em> (don't want to be recognised), he is after any<strong> fowl</strong> for dinner. (fowl = birds such as chicken, duck and turkey)."	Being a Terrorist on the FBI most wanted list, <em>Bin Laden</em> must constantly move from place to place and is never quite certain where is going to sleep. Sometimes he can count on a loyal supporter to let him stay in a spare room, but when traveling to more remote parts of Arabia, he is sometimes forced to sleep under an <em>umbrella</em> with the <strong>fowl</strong>. (which consequently, makes him smell rather foul).					RTK3
檎		apple				2207			キン、 ゴン、 ゴ		"A flying <em>fowl</em> smashes into a <em>tree</em> and all the<strong> apple</strong>s drop off. ""Eureka!"" shouts Newton, who happens to be watching."	<em>Michael Jackson</em> stands under an <em>umbrella</em> in case an<strong> apple</strong> falls way off the <em>tree</em> like he did.

憐		sympathize with				2208			レン	あわ.れむ、 あわ.れ	Tom Cruise - American with sunglasses (thanks synewave). I can't<strong> sympathize with</strong> Tom Cruise's <em>state of mind</em> regarding scientology.	Have you ever seen the really poor looking children on the corner block with a <em>shoe shine</em> stand? I can't help but to<strong> sympathize with</strong> them and give them some extra money. It eases my <em>state of mind</em>.					RTK3
燐		phosphorus				2209			リン		Tom Cruise's shoes caught on fire, because he was using phosphorous to shine them.	The <em>shoeshiner</em> always starts by cleaning the shoes first with<strong> phosphorus</strong>. This is a bit risky, though, and he sets himself on <em>fire</em> (picture him running around in flames).					RTK3
麟		camelopard				2210			リン		As a scientologist, A DEER to TOM CRUISE, is not just a deer. It is actually a descendent of a<strong> camelopard</strong> that was sent by extraterrestrials.	You saw a <strong>camelopard</strong>!? Bullshit! Next your going to tell me that you saw a <em>deer</em> getting a <em>shoeshine</em>. (Actually I saw a <strong>camelopard</strong> getting a <em>shoeshine</em>, but now that you mention it, his body did look like a <em>deer</em>...)					RTK3
鱗		scaled				2211			リン	うろこ、 こけ、 こけら	Little known fact: <em>Tom Cruise</em> turns into a merman at night,<strong> scaled</strong> like a <em>fish</em> and everything. Weird.

(Shoeshines will shine up any type of<strong> scaled</strong> creature, including but not limited to fish and dragons).					RTK3
奄		encompassing				2212			エン	おお.う、 たちまち	Can't work with the Heisig primitive of Dachshund, as the all<strong> encompassing</strong> <em>big eel</em> is obviously the mythical Norse Midgard Snake.	The DACHSHUND is so long he can stretch himself around the circumference of the earth,<strong> encompassing</strong> the whole globe. (It might help to think of the dachshund as the slinky dog from Toy Story.)					RTK3
庵		hermitage				2213			アン	いおり、 いお	The hermit's home, his<strong> hermitage</strong>, is a simple CAVE where he lives with his pet DACHSHUND.

駿		steed				2216			シュン、 スン	すぐ.れる	This should be obvious, owners of prize race horse (STEEDS) are paid to have their<strong> STEED</strong> mate with another (hopefully to produce a prize winning foal). Yep, the<strong> STEED</strong>S are glorified HORSE HOOKERS.	Trojan horse, legal prostitute: The guy told the <em>legal prostitute</em> that he is like a <strong>steed</strong> in the bed and that she should do it for free. However, afterward - being severely disappointed- she considered him more like a <em>Trojan horse</em>.					RTK3
峻		steep				2217			シュン	けわ.しい、 たか.い	There are <em>legal prostitutes</em> waiting on top of a<strong> steep</strong> <em>mountain</em>.

皐		lunar month				2220			コウ	さつき	What's a<strong> lunar month</strong>? The amount of time it takes a <em>white</em> to read just <em>ten</em> pages of the <em>I Ching</em>. Reviewing the Kanji notwithstanding.

畷		rice field footpath				2221			テツ、 テイ、 セイ	なわて	In the <strong><em>rice-field</em> footpath</strong> I found a <em>condom</em> (used to protect you from the one in four crotches that shouldn't be done ヌde) of someone who couldn't afford a hotel.	PRIMITIVE: Four crotches = orgy. The <strong><em>rice-field</em> footpaths</strong> were where we used to have <em>orgies</em> back in the day.					RTK3

For the green onion primitive, I use a pun: Green UN ONE.<strong> Leek</strong>s are milder than green onions, they're more like the flowers of the scallion family.					RTK3
籤		lottery				2227			セン	くじ、 かずとり	I never play the <strong>lottery</strong>. I'd rather be whacked by <em>bamboo</em> staffs as I pass down an <em>assembly line</em> than do that. Of course, when a buddy wins, I'll go to the <em>dagger-axe</em> and enjoy the special salsa packed with <em>green onions</em>, but I will never play the <strong>lottery</strong> myself.	(based on mantixen's) If I won the<strong> lottery</strong>, I wouldn't even need to go speed dating (a <em>dagger-axe</em> to form <em>couples</em>) to find a woman, even if I had <em>onion</em>breath they'd be flocking in my direction. On second thoughts.. I'd better buy a bamboo cane to keep the ugly ones away.					RTK3
懺		penitential				2228			ザン、 サン	くい.る	Someone stole the bamboo from the previous <em>lottery</em>--but I'm sure their <em>state of mind</em> is very<strong> penitential</strong>.	"Indiana Jones: ""The <strong>penitent</strong> man shall pass. The <strong>penitent</strong> man shall pass."" Indy's <em>state of mind</em> is screaming at him that something is wrong. This <em>assembly line</em> of death is giving all kinds of hints that something is wrong.

芻		hay				2229			スウ、 シュウ、 ス	まぐさ	The 2 <em>mountain goats</em> have to <em>bind up</em> all the<strong> hay</strong> then the farmer might give them their horns back.

"Super<strong> Rabbit</strong>: This<strong> rabbit</strong> has helicopter ears and drops pellets on his enemies while flying. Because he's super<strong> rabbit</strong>, he gets his own kanji. Unlike that other loser who is always making excuses. <a href=""/study/kanji/%E5%85%8D"">免</a> (<span class=""frnr"">#2126</span>) He can settle for a primitive."					RTK3
也		est				2236			ヤ、 エ	なり、 か、 また	"This is the kanji for the classical form of ""is"". I think Heisig's keyword ""est"" is the old english or latin word for ""is"". The Scorpion this <strong>est</strong>!"	"""Est"" is the latin third person singular of the verb ""esse"" (to be) in Latin. So, this word has been chosen to point out that this character is found chiefly in Classical Japanese (also names). I imagine an incredibly haughty Latin <em>Scorpion</em>, looking down at his vast <strong>est</strong>ate and saying ""Mihi<strong> est</strong>"". This literally mean ""It is to me"" and means ""It's mine"" ... this is gramatically similar to how Japanese express possession too, incidentally."					RTK3

The first television show that <em>Mr T</em> ever worked on was a slavery period drama.

In each scene requiring slaves in the background to<strong> work a field</strong>, he would put <em>Mr T</em> in the rice paddy in the background. Then when they changed the scene, he would simply put <em>Mr T</em> there too - no changing clothes, no CG - just the same dude in the background of EVERY scene.					RTK3

"Important note: Instead of the keyword ""my son,"" the keyword ""good for nothing son"" may be more appropriate. This word is one of the examples of depreciating titles for family members. This word is used to refer to your son when you especially want to lower his status. So, keep that in mind when deciding on a story or when making your own. I suggest CountPacula's story, since it involves that ""good for nothing son"" meaning a little more."					RTK3
做		make do				2260			サ、 サク、 ソ	な.す、 つく.る	"Note that the meaning of this (rare) kanji is ""<strong>make</strong> (something) / <strong>do</strong> (something)"", not ""get by with"". Story: <em>Mr. T</em> doesn't rely on <em>happenstance</em>, he <strong>makes</strong> things <strong>do</strong> what he wants. Edit: In fact three Japanese kanji dictionaries I checked all list 做 as an alternative to 作 <a href=""/study/kanji/%E4%BD%9C"">作</a> (<span class=""frnr"">#1224</span>), so ""<strong>make (alt)</strong>"" might be the best keyword. Story: <em>Mr. T</em> by <em>happenstance</em> found an <strong>alt</strong>ernative way to <strong>make</strong> things. (See also bennyb &amp; faneca's notes)."	(food for thought) I know this is RTK3 and all, but this kanji seems almost completely useless. The two most common phrases it's included in are 言い做す to speak as though something were actually the case and 見なす to regard (as equivalent). Both of which USUALLY just write なすin kana, and neither of which have anything to do with the meaning. In fact I can't find any trace of Katsuo's suggestion of this meaning. Anyone care to enlighten me? Perhaps this one's worth skipping.					RTK3
冴		sharp				2261			ゴ、 コ	さ.える、 こお.る、 ひ.える	(Note that per Heisig, this doesn't mean 'able to cut'; it means mentally<strong> sharp</strong>, adept, or 'on your toes'!) During the <em>Ice</em> Age, cavemen had to be especially careful around the woolly mammoth, because they were more mentally <em>sharp</em> than they looked. If the cavemen weren't careful, they could end up impaled on the mammoths' <em>tusks</em>!	A<strong> sharp</strong> tusk pointing out of the ice. Probably belongs to a mammoth.					RTK3
凋		wilt				2262			チョウ	しぼ.む	You don't want the lettuce to <strong>wilt</strong>, do you? So, you put <em>ice</em> around the <em>circumference</em> of the serving tray, and then the lettuce on top of that, so it cannot <strong>wilt</strong>.

(The <em>cow</em> in the next frame 牡 is rolling around in the <em>soil</em> and is, not surprisingly, a <strong>male animal</strong>.)	While the bull wants rough sex, the <em>cow</em> would rather <em>spoon</em>, I guess all<strong> female animal</strong>s are the same.					RTK3
牡		male animal				2609			ボ、 ボウ	おす、 お-、 おん-	<strong>Male animal</strong>s are dirty pigs in English, but in Japanese they are <em>dirty cows</em> ボ ボウ おす お- おん-.

琳		chime				2610			リン		The mechanism in my old grandfather clock suddenly broke with an almighty<strong> chime</strong> and one of the <em>jewels</em> was thrown out through the window into a nearby <em>grove</em> of trees.

瑳		burnish				2612			サ	みが.く	"The king's servant got lazy and didn't thoroughly<strong> burnish</strong> some of the king's many jewels, thinking ""he won't notice the difference.""

琢		hone				2613			タク	みが.く	The <em>king</em> realized he looked like a <em>pig</em> and sought to<strong> hone</strong> his body through exercise.	<em>King</em> Henry VIII was keen on hunting wild boar. Here we see him first <strong>honing</strong> his skills on a <em>sow</em>.					RTK3

玖		jet				2617			キュウ、 ク		I spent <em>a long time</em> polishing the <em>king</em>'s jewelry until it was all<strong> jet</strong>-black just like he ordered.

瑛		crystal stone				2618			エイ		He who possesses the<strong> crystal stone</strong> is the rightful <em>king</em> of <em>England</em>.	[+Aerin] Pretty much everything in <em>England</em> is fake. That includes the power of the <em>king</em> (it's a queen now, I know, but still) - everything is handled by the real government, and that post is just a symbol. Appropriately, then, the PM gets all the real diamonds, while the royalty gets the<strong> crystal stone</strong> decorated items.<strong> Crystal stone</strong>, of course, is just a nice way of saying rhinestones.

Waist is the smallest, and for most women the HIPS are wider than the chest.	"A<strong> three</strong>some: a Roman girl getting sandwitched by two blokes yelling ""me too!"" (みつ)."	A Roman family sleeping together horizontally.Can't you see the kid between his parents?	One ( 一 ) on top of two ( 二 ), gives<strong> three</strong> ( 三 ).		
四		four	"This character is composed of two primitive elements, <i>mouth</i> and <i>human legs</i>,  both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the ""story"" connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top-to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast."		5	4	4	1	シ	よ、よ.つ、よっ.つ、よん	<strong>FOUR</strong> year-olds often put their FOOT (human legs) in their MOUTH - but they are too young to realize.	I imagine a giant devouring a human in<strong> four</strong> bites. First the giant bites off the person's head, then he bites the torso, then from the waist to the knees, and finally the giant plucks up the remaining portion of the human legs into his mouth. See the<strong> four</strong>th bite falling in there?	This is a picture of a slab in the morgue. It is pulled out from the drawer, and it is showing only the dead person's feet. Clearly <em>shi</em> means DEATH.	A man inside<strong> four</strong> walls.	<strong>Four</strong> are the <em>legs</em> of the Schrödinger Cat, which is kept in a <em>box</em>, and you don't know if the cat is dead or alive until you open it.		
五		five	As with <i>four</i>, we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for <b>five</b>.		4	5	5	1	ゴ	いつ、いつ.つ	三 + two vertical lines = 5.	"This Kanji looks like a ""3"" Kanji with two added vertical lines. 3+2= 5."	<strong>Five</strong> - has a THREE, and a small 'h'… 'high<strong> five</strong>'.	The letter 'F' is skiing for the 'five' trophies.	"The <em>King</em> (<a href=""../v4/255.html"">king</a> (#255 王)) leaned on the magical <em>walking stick</em> in his left hand which the wizard said would let him ""go"" (ゴ) through the <strong>fifth</strong> dimension."		
六		six	The primitives here are <i>top hat</i> and <i>animal legs</i>. Once again, we glide over them until later.		4	6	6	1	ロク、リク	む、む.つ、むっ.つ、むい	Indicating 6 parts of the human body: head, body, 2 arms, 2 legs.	The Devil, always a gentleman, wears a top hat, but his goat legs, betray the Beast. 666 is his number.	<strong>Six</strong>-Six-SIX ((666)) Mark of the Beast!! Imagine that dapper old beastly fellow summoning his top hat to himself. See it scamper over to him on a little pair of beastly legs.	"Someone lying spread-eagle, ready for ""sex"" (<strong> SIX</strong> ). —or— Hey, everyone! Come see! I just trapped a<strong> SIX</strong>-inch gremlin under my <em>top-hat</em>!"	The<strong> six</strong> members of a person, however the torso was eat by the devil (666).		
七		seven	"Note that the first stroke ""cuts"" through the second. This distinguishes <b>seven</b> from the character for <i>spoon</i> (Frame 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short."	"* As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of <i>diced</i>, i.e., ""cut"" into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for <i>cut</i> to be learned in a later lesson (Frame 89)."	2	7	7	1	シチ	なな、なな.つ、なの	This kanji is our good old<strong> seven</strong>, turned upside down.	I wrote it upside down so I crossed it out.	Almost katakana SE =<strong> SEVEN</strong>.	I <em>crossed</em> it out because I wrote this<strong> SEVEN</strong> <em>upside down</em>.	If you take the line in the middle out, it's an upside down<strong> seven</strong>, Ta-da!		
八		eight	"Just as the Arabic numeral ""8"" is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for <b>eight</b> is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the ""lazy 8"" is the mathematical symbol for ""infinity,"" so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something ""all-encompassing."""		2	8	8	1	ハチ	や、や.つ、やっ.つ、よう	"""Hachi"" (eight) begins with the sound of the <strong>katakana ""ha""</strong>, and it's approximately the same character."	The valcano hasn't erupted for 8 years.	The curtains close at<strong> eight</strong>.	I<strong> eight</strong> something so large, it bent my chopsticks.	I<strong> eight</strong> a volcano! now I got heart burn.		
九		nine	If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for <i>power</i> (Frame 922).	* As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean <i>baseball team</i> or simply <i>baseball</i>. The meaning, of course, is derived from the <i>nine</i> players who make up a team.	2	9	9	1	キュウ、ク	ここの、ここの.つ	<em>Warning - naughty reminder</em> A woman in the doggie style position, waiting for my<strong> NINE</strong> inches.	"Kinda of looks like the kanji of 1 一 with the kanji of 8 八 added. So think of it as <a href=""midori://search?text=%E4%B8%80%EF%BC%8B%E5%85%AB%EF%BC%9D%E4%B9%9D"">一＋八＝九</a> ."	"It looks like an elaborate letter ""n"" for<strong> nine</strong>."	Girl waiting in doggy-style position for her boyfriend. If only she knew back then she would get pregnant and would have to carry a baby for<strong> nine</strong> months!	<strong>Nine</strong> baseball players, bowing low on the ground on hands and knees, before the game starts. おねがいします！.		
十		ten	Turn this character 45 degrees either way and you have the x used for the Roman numeral <b>ten</b>.	* As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of <i>ten</i> and sometimes signifies <i>needle</i>, this latter derived from the kanji for <i>needle</i> (Frame 292). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly.	2	10	10	1	ジュウ、ジッ、ジュッ	とお、と	Two needles crossing marks the spot, or you can use the Roman character for<strong> ten</strong> (rotated 45 degrees).	I scared away<strong> ten</strong> vampires with a single cross!	<strong>Ten</strong> looks like a plus sign.	A roman<strong> ten</strong> (X) standing on one leg.	T for<strong> ten</strong>.		
口		mouth	Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for <b>mouth</b> is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle.	* As a primitive, this form also means <i>mouth</i>. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests - an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head - can be used for the primitive meaning.	3	11	11	1	コウ、ク	くち	Looks like a huge open<strong> mouth</strong>.	When you sneeze, your<strong> MOUTH</strong> forms a square, and you make a noise that sounds like (KUCHI).	"If you say ""kuchi"" one more time, I'm going to <em>box</em> you in the<strong> mouth</strong>. (""kuchi"" is how your pronounce this kanji, box is the memory symbol )."	"Momma used to say: ""Keep your trap shut!"" This thing is shaped like a trap door."	Sponge Bob Square<strong> Mouth</strong>.		
日		day	"This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun - like those yellow badges with the words, ""Have a nice <b>day</b>!"""	"* Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean <i>sun</i> or <i>day</i> or a <i>tongue wagging in the mouth</i>. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like ""sayeth"" and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Frame 620)."	4	12	12	1	ニチ、ジツ	ひ、-び、-か	Open the window, new<strong> day</strong>.	Picture two halves of a 24-hr period:<strong> Day</strong> & Night.	Open window because its a <em>sunny</em><strong> day</strong>.	On Sun<strong>day</strong>, church-goers sings hymns, their <em>tongues wagging in their mouths</em>.	"=sun;<strong> day</strong>： Each time the SUN rises a new<strong> DAY</strong> begins. <a href=""../v4/12.html"">day</a> (#12 日) is a picture of the sun. Normally we draw the sun with a circle(ㅇ) surrounded by many strokes. But there are no “round” shaped Kanji so we take <a href=""../v4/11.html"">mouth</a> (#11 口) instead, and one stroke in the middle (one (#1 一)) representing all. 日本 Japan, 日曜日 （ニチジヨウび）Sunday, 毎日 （マイニチ）everyday, 母の日 （ははのひ）mother's<strong> day</strong>, 日記 （ニッキ）diary, 三日 （ミッカ）three<strong> day</strong>s."		
月		month	"This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical ""man in the moon."" (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one <b>month</b>, of course, is one cycle of the moon."	* As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of <i>moon</i>, <i>flesh</i>, or <i>part of the body</i>. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter.	4	13	13	1	ゲツ、ガツ	つき	A<strong> month</strong> is longer than a day.	"Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air ""mooning"" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of<strong> month</strong>, considering that<strong> month</strong>s were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning ""ass"" part of it connects well to Hesig's seemingly unconnected ""flesh"" or ""part of the body"" meaning (when used in primitive form)."	<strong>Month</strong> - every MOON cycle, werewolves eat FLESH, and other PARTs OF THE BODY.	Once a<strong> month</strong>, the moon is full.	A<strong> month</strong> is longer than a day.		
田		rice field	Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird's-eye view of a <b>rice field</b> divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4.	* When used as a primitive element, the meaning of <i>rice field</i> is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of <i>brains</i> from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls.	5	14	14	1	デン	た	A<strong> rice field</strong> divided into four parts.	<em>Ten</em> people use their <em>mouths</em> to eat the yield of the <strong>rice fields</strong>.	<em>Ten</em><strong> rice field</strong>s can feed many <em>mouths</em>.	A farmer must use his <em>brain</em> to measure out a 4-plot <strong>rice field</strong>.	One day the farmer is neatly digging his<strong> rice field</strong> chopping down with his spade in two directions at 90 degrees, when suddenly there is a crunching sound as he has chopped twice into the skull of a dead body exposing the <strong>brain</strong>s sliced into four pieces. Ughhh !		
目		eye	Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an <b>eye</b>.	* As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of <i>eye</i>, or more specifically, an <i>eyeball</i>. When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side.	5	15	15	1	モク、ボク	め、-め、ま-	目 _ 目 .	There are 3 sections. Imagine the outer two being the whites of your<strong> eye</strong>. The middle is the pupil. Fill it in with imaginary color.	This one comes from an ancient character that was an<strong> eye</strong>. It is an<strong> eye</strong> rotated in 90 degree but got squared (think about anime style<strong> eye</strong>s).	目 _ 目 .	( 目 _ 目 ).		
古		old	"The primitive elements that compose this character are <i>ten</i> and <i>mouth</i>, but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with <b>old</b> inscriptions on the tombstones. This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character ""drawings."""	* Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of <i>old</i>, but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible.	5	16	16	2	コ	ふる.い、ふる-、-ふる.す	Tombstone and cross on an<strong> old</strong> man's grave.	You get<strong> OLD</strong> fast if you have ten open mouths to feed.	<strong>Old</strong> people tend to talk a lot. Almost as if they had TEN MOUTHS!	The<strong> old</strong> man had only <em>10</em> teeth in his <em>mouth</em>.	A story is<strong> OLD</strong> when it has been told by <em>TEN MOUTH</em>s.		
吾		I	"There are actually a number of kanji for the word <b>I</b>, but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the ""perceiving subject."" Now the one place in our bodies that all <i>five</i> senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than <i>five mouths</i>: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, <i>five mouths</i> = <b>I</b>."		7	17	17	2	ゴ	われ、わが-、あ-	I have 5 senses.	I eat five times at day.	<strong>I</strong> consist of <em>five</em> senses to observe, one <em>mouth</em> to speak. <em>For order, remember that observing through the senses should be done before using one's mouth</em>.	I have two eyes, nose, two ears = 5 plus one mouth.	I can fit all five of my fingers in my mouth! :D.		
冒		risk	Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the <i>sun</i> for fear you might burn out your <i>eyes</i>? Probably you were foolish enough to <b>risk</b> a quick glance once or twice; but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a <i>sun</i> above and an <i>eye</i> right below looking up at it has the meaning of <b>risk</b> (see frame 12).		9	18	18	2	ボウ	おか.す	Don't look at the sun directly with your eyes, it's<strong> risk</strong>y!	You'll<strong> risk</strong> your eyesight if you look up at the sun.	"Looking up at the big sun is a<strong> risk</strong> to your eye. To remember that the sun primitive is bigger than the eye primitive, imagine making your eyes little (squinting) when you go out in the bright sun to reduce the<strong> risk</strong> of getting sun blindness. READING: imagine a kid saying ""oh that's ぼう (bull as in B.S.), looking at the sun is no<strong> risk</strong>!"" [he's blind now]."	Staring into the big <em>sun</em> can<strong> risk</strong> your <em>eye</em>sight! HINT: It looks like a pipe from Super Mario Bros. It might be<strong> risk</strong>y to go down it. :p.	If you look at the <em>sun</em> high in the sky directly with your <em>eyes</em> below, you're taking a big<strong> risk</strong>.		
朋		companion	"The first <b>companion</b> that God made, as the Bible story goes, was Eve. Upon seeing her, Adam exclaimed, ""<i>Flesh</i> of my <i>flesh</i>!"" And that is precisely what this character says in so many strokes."		8	19	19	2	ホウ	とも	My<strong> companion</strong> and I are like two moons side by side.	One moon is lonely. Two moons are<strong> companion</strong>s.	Under the twin moons of Tatooine, Luke had no<strong> COMPANION</strong>.	Two bodies next to each other;<strong> companion</strong>s.	Real<strong> companion</strong>s stay together during dark times, under many MOONS, or many MONTHS…		
明		bright	Among nature's <b>bright</b> lights, there are two that the biblical myth has God set in the sky: the <i>sun</i> to rule over the day and the <i>moon</i> to rule the night. Each of them has come to represent one of the common connotations of this key word: the <i>sun</i>, the <b>bright</b> insight of the clear thinker, and the <i>moon</i>, the <b>bright</b> intuition of the poet and the seer (see frame 13).		8	20	20	2	メイ、ミョウ、ミン	あ.かり、あか.るい、あか.るむ、あか.らむ、あき.らか、あ.ける、-あ.け、あ.く、あ.くる、あ.かす	The sun makes the moon<strong> bright</strong>.	The sun and the moon are<strong> bright</strong>est objects in the day and night, respectively.	"In the long run, the REAL trouble here is distinguishing it from ""shining""/""sparkle"". Choose a story to learn how to write 明 . To distinguish it, remember the Japanese word 明日 (ashita, ""tomorrow"") and think of Orphan Annie singing ""<em>Tomorrow</em> is a<strong> bright</strong>er day""."	The SUN is<strong> BRIGHT</strong>ER than the MOON.	"About the order of the primitives: The phrase that I usually hear is ""the sun and moon,"" so to help me remember the order, I'll remember that phrase. Oh! Better yet, I'll put them <em>in order of<strong> bright</strong>ness</em>."		
唱		chant	This one is easy! You have one <i>mouth</i> making no noise (the choirmaster) and two <i>mouths with wagging tongues</i> (the minimum for a chorus). So think of the key word, <b>chant</b>, as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see frame 11).		11	21	21	2	ショウ	とな.える	Someone<strong> chant</strong>ing with their mouth open for two consecutive days.	<strong>Chant</strong>s from our mouths are meant to reach the sun and the stars. Stars are just suns just further away so they seem smaller.	His <em>mouth</em><strong> chant</strong>s always when <em>prosperous</em>.	The monk opened his month and<strong> chant</strong>ed for two days.	"A yogi opens his <em>mouth</em> and<strong> chant</strong>s for <em>two straight days</em>! [So, did you reach nirvana? ""Nah, got a wicked sore throat, though.""]."		
晶		sparkle	"What else can the word <b>sparkle</b> suggest if not a diamond? And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature <i>sun</i>. This kanji is a picture of a tiny <i>sun</i> in three places (that is, ""everywhere""), to give the sense of something that <b>sparkles</b> on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole."		12	22	22	2	ショウ		A diamond<strong> sparkle</strong>s as brightly as three suns.	"<strong>Sparkle</strong> is a <a href=""../v4/197.html"">forest</a> (#197 森) of <em>suns</em>!"	<strong>Sparkle</strong>, three suns sparkling like zelda pyramids ;-).	Nothing<strong> sparkle</strong>s like <em>3 suns</em>!	Wow - Has been ages since I got this character up in a review, I failed it because I thought of a different kanji. Anyway this Kanji has a lot to do with crystals and crystal structure 液晶 liquid crystal, 結晶 crystal, crystallization, crystallisation, 結晶学 crystallography. So the connotation of 'diamond' is really good - maintain that and it will easily let you fall back to its main usage of crystals.		
品		goods	"As in the character for <i>sparkle</i>, the triplication of a single element in this character indicates ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of."" When we think of <b>goods</b> in modern industrial society, we think of what has been mass-produced - that is to say, produced for the ""masses"" of open <i>mouths</i> waiting like fledglings in a nest to ""consume"" whatever comes their way."		9	23	23	2	ヒン、ホン	しな	<em>Three boxes</em> of<strong> goods</strong> are devoured by the hungry <em>mouths</em> of waiting consumers.	Three hungry mouths waiting for the<strong> goods</strong> to come.	Boxes of<strong> goods</strong> stacked on top of the other.	Three stacked crates of <em>mouth</em>-watering<strong> GOODS</strong>, ready for delivery to the restaurant.	Three MOUTHs talk about these <em>three boxes</em> of<strong> GOODS</strong> : the producer’s, the supplier’s and the customer’s.		
呂		spine	This character is rather like a picture of two of the vertebrae in the <b>spine</b> linked by a single stroke.		7	24	24	2	ロ、リョ	せぼね	<strong>Spine</strong> connects head and body.	The<strong> spine</strong> goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (genitals). Just think of these openings being enlarged to represent the head and the body. The bottom is bigger because the body is bigger than the face.	The<strong> spine</strong> goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (in your ass).	I looks like two vertebrae connected by nerve threads.	"In ""The Human Centipede"", one<strong> spine</strong> connects two mouths to keep the food circulating."		
昌		prosperous	"What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of"" was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see <i>two suns</i>, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the <i>three suns</i> of <i>sparkle</i>. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of <b>prosperous</b> times as <i>sunny</i>, what could be more <b>prosperous</b> than a sky with <i>two suns</i> in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there."		8	25	25	2	ショウ	さかん	If you work from Sun UP to Sun DOWN you will be<strong> prosperous</strong>.	I kept getting this mixed up with meanings like 'fortune', so here is a fool proof story! Remember the Vulcan salute from 'Star Trek' (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase 'live long and PROSPER'? If that's not enough of a visual reminder, the Vulcan salute shows the fingers parted in to 2 sets of 2, and visually kind of looks like this kanji if you think about it.	When you are<strong> prosperous</strong>, your gold shines as brightly as two suns.	The Egyptians were<strong> prosperous</strong> because every two days, they worshiped the sun god at the sun pyramid. (Thanks for the idea adhmm, for a while I have had trouble remembering which sun is biggest. Got it now!).	If you work from <em>sun up</em> to <em>sun down</em> you will be<strong> prosperous</strong>.		
早		early	This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the <i>sun</i>flower, since it begins with the element for <i>sun</i> and is held upon a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine <i>sun</i>flowers with <i>needles</i> for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of <b>early</b> is easily remembered if one thinks of the <i>sun</i>flower as the <b>early</b> riser in the garden, because the <i>sun</i>, showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10).	* As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of <i>sunflower</i>, which was used to make the abstract key word <i>early</i> more graphic.	6	26	26	2	ソウ、サッ	はや.い、はや、はや-、はや.まる、はや.める、さ-	The <em>sun</em> up is<strong> early</strong>, well before <em>ten</em>.	An<strong> early</strong> sun-flower looks like a miniature sun perched on a needlelike stems.	<strong>EARLY</strong>, is when you have to start your <em>day</em> before <em>10</em>..	The <em>sun</em> rises<strong> early</strong> - before <em>ten</em>.	Sun flower blossom<strong> early</strong>.		
旭		rising sun	This character is a sort of nickname for the Japanese flag with its well-known emblem of the <b>rising sun</b>. If you can picture two seams running down that great red <i>sun</i>, and then imagine it sitting on a <i>baseball</i> bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent - but not altogether inaccurate - picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the <b>Rising Sun</b>.		6	27	27	2	キョク	あさひ	9am carries with it the<strong> rising sun</strong>.	<em>Nine planets</em> revolve around our<strong> rising sun</strong>.	The sun rises before 9am.	When the clock says <em>9</em> on the left, you can see the <strong>rising <em>sun</em></strong> in the east (right).	A baseball player hits the sun and it becomes the<strong> rising sun</strong>.		
世		generation	"We generally consider one <b>generation</b> as a period of thirty (or <i>ten</i> plus <i>ten</i> plus <i>ten</i>) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form - not in its stroke order - you will see three <i>tens</i>. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as ""addition"" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: <i>ten</i> ""plus"" <i>ten</i> ""plus"" <i>ten</i> = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book."		5	28	28	2	セイ、セ、ソウ	よ、さんじゅう	3 tens =<strong> generation</strong>.	"They <strong>SAY</strong> a<strong> generation</strong> is <em>ten</em>+<em>ten</em>+<em>ten</em> years, with the big first <em>ten</em> providing a <em>grounding</em>, and the next <em>ten</em> providing a little more <em>grounding</em> for the final <em>ten</em>. But I wish the next<strong> generation</strong> didn't always <strong>SAY</strong> ""<strong>yo!</strong>"". (ON reading is SEI, KUN reading is yo)."	The next<strong> generation</strong> is carried by the previous ones.	That swing has been in that tree for<strong> generation</strong>s.	This looks like a picture of a test tube in a holder. Maybe it will be used to create test tube babies for a future<strong> generation</strong>.		
胃		stomach	"You will need to refer back to frames 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: <i>flesh</i> (<i>part of the body</i>) and <i>brain</i>. What the kanji says, if you look at it, is that the <i>part of the body</i> that keeps the <i>brain</i> in working order is the <b>stomach</b>. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this kanji think of the <i>brain</i> as being ""held up"" by the <i>flesh</i>."		9	29	29	2	イ		The <em>rice field</em> is harvested once a <em>month</em> to get food for our<strong> stomach</strong>.	The<strong> stomach</strong> is the part of the body that digests food (which, in Japan, is mainly rice).	The<strong> stomach</strong> is the part of the body ( 月 ）that tells my brain ( 田 ) when to eat rice.	The astronaut had an empty <em>stomach</em> because you can't grow <strong>rice</strong> <em>on the</em> <strong>moon</strong>.	A field of rice could fill my<strong> stomach</strong> for over a month.		
旦		nightbreak	"While we normally refer to the start of the day as ""daybreak,"" Japanese commonly refers to it as the ""opening up of night"" into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, <b>nightbreak</b>. The single stroke at the bottom represents the <i>floor</i> (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the <i>sun</i> is poking its head"		5	30	30	2	タン、ダン	あき.らか、あきら、ただし、あさ、あした	A<strong> nightbreak</strong> happens when the sun rises over the horizon (floor).	"It may be easier to think of the keyword ""DAYBREAK"" or ""MORNING"" for this kanji (other kanji dictionaries do). Then the mnemonic phrase ""SUN rising over the HORIZON"" works better. It is an infrequent kanji, but can be found in: 旦夕 （たんせき） morning and evening, or 元旦 （がんたん） New Year's Day."	The <em>sun</em> rising over the horizon is giving the <strong>night</strong> a <strong>break</strong>. -<strong>nightbreak</strong>.	"HINT: You can substitute <strong>sunrise</strong> in your stories if you don't like the rare (and ambiguous) ""nightbreak"". Note that <a href=""../v4/1201.html"">daybreak</a> (#1201 暁) is already taken. Don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/27.html"">rising sun</a> (#27 旭), which is the sun itself, rather than the time of the day."	<strong>Nightbreak</strong>s when the <em>sun</em> peeks over the <em>horizon</em> at dawn.		
胆		gall bladder	"The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for <i>part of the body</i>, and on the right, the character for <i>nightbreak</i>, which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the <b>gall bladder</b> is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the <b>gall bladder</b> is supposed to filter out), and change it to ""not letting the <i>night break</i> on your anger"" (or your <b>gall</b>) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then ""sleeping it off."""		9	31	31	2	タン	きも	The moon has a lot of gall sticking around after sunrise.	All the <em>month</em> long I have to start working at <em>nightbreak</em>. This really activates my<strong> gall bladder</strong> (=I get angry).	For a month（ 月 ）, I was up until nightbreak（ 旦 ） because of my<strong> gall bladder</strong>（ 胆 ）.	The<strong> gall bladder</strong> digests the flesh (meat) before nightbreak so you are ready to start your new day.	If you drink all night long (moon), until the night break your<strong> gall bladder</strong> will have problems…		
亘		span	"""Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset..."" goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof. You can almost see the journey of the sun as it moves from one horizon (the <i>floor</i>) to its noonday heights in the sky overhead (<i>ceiling</i>) and then disappears over the other horizon - day after day, marking the <b>span</b> of our lives."		6	32	32	2	コウ、カン	わた.る、もと.める	The sun<strong> span</strong>s from horizon to horizon in a day.	The<strong> span</strong> of the day is the time between the sun goes up and comes down.	The sunlight<strong> span</strong>s from the floor to the ceiling.	The sun<strong> span</strong>s the heaven and the earth.	A sun<strong> span</strong>-wich.		
凹		concave	"You couldn't have asked for a better key word for this kanji! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a <b>concave</b> lens (remembering, of course, that the kanji square off rounded things), complete with its own little ""cave."" Now all you have to do is learn how to write it."		5	33	33	2	オウ	くぼ.む、へこ.む、ぼこ	"The letter ""U"" is<strong> concave</strong>ly written."	<strong>Concave</strong> has a<strong> concave</strong> shape.	Stroke order: I took a step down into the cave. A park ranger threw down a line to me from the opposite top ridge, then waited. My friend went down to the lowest passage to look for me, then the ranger threw another line down to her.	<strong>Concave</strong> is like a vagina.	Her<strong> CONCAVE</strong> 凹 pussy was fucked by my convex 凸 cock.		
凸		convex	Maybe this helps you see how the Japanese have no trouble keeping <b>convex</b> distinct from <i>concave</i>. Note the odd feeling of the third stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it.		5	34	34	2	トツ	でこ	When I get <em>vex</em>ed, I give people the middle finger.	<strong>Convex</strong> has a<strong> convex</strong> shape.	Sex makes me<strong> convex</strong>.	Men are<strong> convex</strong>; women are complex.	Japanese Idol's make my pants<strong> convex</strong>.		
旧		olden times	"A <i>walking stick</i> is needed for <i>days</i> of <b>olden times</b>, since <i>days</i>, too, get old - at least insofar as we refer to them as the ""good old days."" The main thing here is to think of ""good old days"" when you hear the key word <b>olden times</b>. The rest will take care of itself."		5	35	35	3	キュウ	ふる.い、もと	Age 18 =<strong> olden times</strong>.	The old man with a walking stick kept talking of<strong> olden times</strong> all day long.	In<strong> olden times</strong>, gentlemen used <em>walking sticks</em> every <em>day</em>.	In the<strong> olden times</strong> the sun used a walking stick, cursing and swinging at planets as they whizzed by.	The number 18 on an<strong> olden times</strong> calculator.		
自		oneself	You can think of this kanji as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little <i>drop</i> that Mother Nature set between your <i>eyes</i>. The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose - giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for <b>oneself</b>.	* The same meaning of <i>oneself</i> can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of <i>nose</i> or <i>nostrils</i>, both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for <i>nose</i> (Frame 733).	6	36	36	3	ジ、シ	みずか.ら、おの.ずから、おの.ずと	To use an eyedropper by<strong> oneself</strong>, aim from <em>above</em> to put a <em>drop</em> into the <em>eye</em>.	Faced with his clone, our hero valiantly cut a <em>mark</em> on his forehead right above his <em>eye</em> so that his comrades could tell his true<strong> oneself</strong> from the enemy.	"I know this, but I am an idiot and forgot…. The way I remember this is to think of the way in which Japanese people point to themselves if they are unsure of who is being spoken to. In the west, we usually say, ""me?"" and point to ourselves (pointing to the chest), but in Japan, people say, ""ore/boku/atashi?"" and point directly at their nose, the drop between their eyes. True story."	Eyedrops are applied by<strong> ONESELF</strong>.	Me, myself and eye.		
白		white	The color <b>white</b> is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the sun. Hence, a single <i>drop</i> of <i>sun</i> spells <b>white</b>.	* As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of <i>white</i> or take the more graphic meaning of a <i>white bird</i> or <i>dove</i>. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for <i>bird</i>, which we shall get to later (Frame 2091).	5	37	37	3	ハク、ビャク	しろ、しら-、しろ.い	A<strong> white</strong> ray is a drop of sun.	Even a small drop (') of the sun ( 日 ) would make you see nothing but<strong> white</strong>.	It's a nice DAY for a<strong> WHITE</strong> wedding.	<strong>WHITE</strong> is a drop of sun.	A <em>drop</em> one <em>day</em> fell from above; it was<strong> white</strong> and from a <em>dove</em>… gross.		
百		hundred	"The Japanese refer to a person's 99th birthday as a ""<i>white</i> year"" because <i>white</i> is the kanji you are left with if you subtract <i>one</i> from a <b>hundred</b>."		6	38	38	3	ヒャク、ビャク	もも	100 turned sideways. sort of the same as what ashoksaraf said.	That dirty ceiling was painted WHITE a<strong> hundred</strong> times!	<strong>Hundred</strong> is 1 0 0 written from top to bottom. 一 is connected with the two concatenated 口 because the latter would otherwise fall off.	"The ""white year"" (99) plus one more. 100!"	Two O hung on one.		
中		in	The elements here are a <i>walking stick</i> and a <i>mouth</i>. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine <b>in</b> your <i>mouth</i>? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather's <i>walking stick</i>, to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something <b>in</b> from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil <b>in</b>to a baby's mouth.		4	39	39	3	チュウ	なか、うち、あた.る	Pocky goes<strong> in</strong> the mouth.	My GF lets me come<strong> in</strong> her mouth (pictogram).	It's my dick<strong> in</strong> a box!	I use chopsticks to put food<strong> in</strong> my mouth.	<strong>In</strong>diana Jones thrust a <em>walking stick</em><strong> in</strong> the crocadile's <em>mouth</em> just<strong> in</strong> time!		
千		thousand	This kanji is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the <i>drop</i> above and the <i>ten</i> below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an <i>eyedropper</i> alongside the number <i>ten</i> to make it a <b>thousand</b>.		3	40	40	3	セン	ち	It takes many drops of ten to get to a<strong> thousand</strong>.	<em>One</em> T = one<strong> thousand</strong>.	<strong>1000</strong> = <em>10</em>^3 (<em>3 strokes</em>).	The primitives of <em>drop</em> and <em>needles</em> are at work here. One drop from this needle could save <strong>thousands</strong> of lives!	The number ten bought a fancy hat for a<strong> THOUSAND</strong> yen!		
舌		tongue	"The primitive for <i>mouth</i> and the character for <i>thousand</i> naturally form the idea of <b>tongue</b> if one thinks of a <i>thousand mouths</i> able to speak the same language, or as we say, ""sharing a common <b>tongue</b>."" It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single <b>tongue</b> being passed around from <i>mouth</i> to <i>mouth</i>."		6	41	41	3	ゼツ	した	What is in a <em>mouth</em> that permits it to speak a <em>thousand</em> things? Yes, a <strong>tongue</strong>.	A <em>thousand mouths</em> speak the same<strong> TONGUE</strong>.	Kissing a <em>thousand</em> <em>mouths</em> eventually gets you some<strong> tongue</strong>.	Thousand mouths, a thousand<strong> tongue</strong>s.	"When you <em>drop</em> because you are <a href=""../v4/16.html"">old</a> (#16 古), you stick your<strong> tongue</strong> out."		
升		measuring box	This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a <i>thousand</i> sharp <i>needles</i>, and the quaint little <b>measuring box</b> becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of <i>thousand</i>. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last.		4	42	42	3	ショウ	ます	It is a thousand or ten? I need my<strong> measuring box</strong>.	I can fit a thousand needles into my<strong> measuring box</strong>, but only if I bend the thousand.	A<strong> measuring box</strong> is a square wooden box that was used to measure one thousand grains of rice (needles) in feudal Japan. It was supposed to be enough to feed a working man for one day.	Be careful when drinking sake out of a deep<strong> measuring box</strong>. The hangover can feel like a thousand needles.	Give me a thousand smacks with a walking stick if I forget the Kanji for<strong> measuring box</strong> again!		
昇		rise up	"Our image here is made up of two primitive elements: a <i>sun</i> and a <i>measuring box</i>. Just as the <i>sun</i> can be seen <b>rising up</b> in the morning from - where else - the Land of the Rising Sun, this kanji has the <i>sun</i> <b>rising up</b> out of a Japanese <i>measuring box</i> - the ""<i>measuring box</i> of the <b>rising-up</b> <i>sun</i>."""		8	43	43	3	ショウ	のぼ.る	"This kanji does not mean ""get up"" or ""awake."" It means rising, like the rising of a salary, or a promotion. STORY: You know that your salary has RISEN UP when your MEASURING BOX has enough dollar bills in it to reach the SUN."	We Measure the Sun to decide when we should<strong> Rise Up</strong> out of bed.	If the <em>sun</em> sat on the <em>measuring box</em> made of a thousand needles he would<strong> rise up</strong> very quickly.	In old Japan the villagers used to put their measuring box on an east facing window ledge so that the sun would<strong> rise up</strong> above it and hence would be the first thing they saw in the morning. This was to remind them to use the box to measure out their kome for asagohan and ensure their store of rice would last the whole week.	"""When sun<strong> RISE UP</strong>, get sake cup.""."		
丸		round	"We speak of ""<b>round</b> numbers,"" or ""<b>rounding</b> a number off,"" meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest <i>drop</i>, to <i>nine</i>, you end up with a <b>round</b> number."	* As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a <i>fat man</i>. Think of a grotesquely <i>fat man</i> whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a <i>round baseball player</i> becomes a <i>fat man</i>.	3	44	44	3	ガン	まる、まる.める、まる.い	Nine plus a drop<strong> round</strong>s it off to ten!	"Watch out for <a href=""../v4/120.html"">plump</a> (#120 太). Here Heisig could have added a ""t"" and we would have had a much better keyword : <strong>rotund</strong>. <strong>Rotund</strong> is more specific than ""round"" which begs for confusion with <a href=""../v4/1811.html"">circle</a> (#1811 円). A dictionary search on ""fat"" or ""round"" doesn't yield this kanji, but ""rotund"" does! Primitive suggestion: the <em>Laughing Buddha</em> is often depicted as a <strong>rotund</strong>, smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude)."	NINE plus a little DROP to <strong>round</strong> up to ten.	Cut the tail off of a 9 and it will be<strong> round</strong>.	In nine months a drop of sperm can make a woman very<strong> round</strong>.		
寸		measurement	This kanji actually stood for a small <b>measurement</b> used prior to the metric system, a bit over an inch in length, and from there acquired the sense of <b>measurement</b>. In the old system, it was one-<i>tenth</i> of a <i>shaku</i> (whose kanji we shall meet in frame 1151). The picture, appropriately, represents one <i>drop</i> of a <i>ten</i> (with a hook!).	* As a primitive, we shall use this to mean <i>glue</i> or <i>glued to</i>. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard NOT to remember it.	3	45	45	3	スン		The decimal system uses <em>drops</em> of <em>ten</em> as a<strong> measurement</strong>.	Glue two sticks together to make the best<strong> measurement</strong>. (I always remember the primitive, but never the original keyword.).	Use two lines (X axis and Y axis) to measure the dot (on the graph).	Take your medicine, exactly <em>ten</em> <em>drops</em>. Picture yourself <strong>measuring</strong> it out with a pipette.	A single shaku is divided into 10 sun ( 寸 ). The original definition for shaku was the average distance between growth nodes on a bamboo. Thus a <em>tenth</em> of a shaku is a<strong> measurement</strong>.		
肘		elbow	"Instead of the familiar ""grease"" we usually associate with the <b>elbow</b> of someone hard at work, the kanji gives us a <i>part of the body</i> that has been <i>glued to</i> its task."		7	46	2464	3	チュウ	ひじ	Sometimes I get carried away and do<strong> elbow</strong> curls until the point where my forearm snaps off! When that happens I simply pull out the <em>glue</em> and re-attach the<strong> elbow</strong> to my <em>flesh</em>.	Picture two Siamese twins glued together at the<strong> elbow</strong>.	The<strong> elbow</strong> is the <em>flesh</em> that <em>glues</em> together the upper and lower arm.	A <em>body part</em> that's used as a <em>measurement</em> in former days: the <strong>elbow</strong>.	"A <em>body part</em> used in the expression ""<strong>Elbow</strong> room"" as a <em>measure</em> of how much space exists around us."		
専		specialty	"<i>Ten</i> . . . <i>rice fields</i> . . . <i>glue</i>. That is how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sentence out of these elements, we get: ""<i>Ten rice fields glued</i> together."" A <b>specialty</b>, of course, refers to one's special ""<i>field</i>"" of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain content with a single <b>specialty</b> and usually extend themselves in other <i>fields</i> as well. This is how we come to get the picture of <i>ten fields glued</i> together to represent a <b>specialty</b>."		9	47	46	3	セン	もっぱ.ら	After you have chosen your <em>10</em> <em>fields</em> of study, <em>measure</em> how good you are at each to find out your<strong> specialty</strong>.	10 brains glued together allows you to specialize in any<strong> specialty</strong> that you want. Imagine each brain having its own<strong> specialty</strong>.	She's so good at her <strong>speciality</strong>, it's like <em>ten</em> <em>brains</em> <em>glue</em>d together.	I'm a Rice Field Measurer! That is, my<strong> specialty</strong> is 'measuring' 'ten' 'rice fields' at a time.	A person's<strong> specialty</strong> or <em>field</em>, may change <em>up</em> to <em>ten</em> times before they finally settle <em>down</em> and <em>stick</em> with their liking.		
博		Dr.	At the left we have the <i>needle</i>; at the right, the kanji for <i>specialty</i>, plus an extra <i>drop</i> at the top. Think of a <b>Dr.</b> who is a <i>specialist</i> with a <i>needle</i> (an acupuncturist) and let the <i>drop</i> at the top represent the period at the end of <b>Dr.</b> In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.	* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the <i>needle</i> on the left and gets the meaning of an <i>acupuncturist</i>.	12	48	47	3	ハク、バク		<em>Ten specialties</em> grants you the title of<strong> Dr.</strong> with a dot.	"Watch for <a href=""../v4/1694.html"">doctor</a> (#1694 医), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well ""learned"", with extensive knowledge. This could apply to any kind of field. The kanji 医 (""doctor"") is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as ""Dr. Who"", ""Dr. Jekyll"", even ""Dr. Dobb's"" if you're into programming."	<em>Needles</em> are a<strong> Dr.</strong>'s <em>specialty</em>.	"<strong>Dr</strong>. Who weaves like a <em>needle</em> through the fabric of time, to <em>drop</em> in unexpectedly has become his <a href=""../v4/46.html"">specialty</a> (#46 専) ."	Note: Use <strong>Ph.D.</strong> rather than <strong>Dr.</strong> to avoid confusion with <strong>doctor</strong> and to be more in line with common use of this kanji. <em>Ten</em> <em>specialities</em> grants you the title of <strong>Ph.D.</strong> with a <em>dot</em>.		
占		fortune-telling	This is one of those kanji that is a real joy of simplicity: a <i>divining rod</i> with a <i>mouth</i> - which translate directly into <b>fortune-telling</b>. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first <i>divining rod</i>, then <i>mouth</i>. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do.		5	49	48	3	セン	し.める、うらな.う	<strong>Fortune-telling</strong>: using a mouth as a divining rod.	"A great number of people who do<strong> fortune-telling</strong> are ""almost old""."	To do<strong> fortune-telling</strong> put a <em>magic wand</em> in your <em>mouth</em>.	The mouth of a fortune-teller is a superior (above) mouth.	The old fortune teller was missing an arm.		
上		above	"The two directions, <b>above</b> and below, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a <i>magic wand</i> standing <b><i>above</i></b> a <i>floor</i> - ""magically,"" you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words <b>above</b> and <i>below</i> suggest each other."		3	50	49	3	ジョウ、ショウ、シャン	うえ、-うえ、うわ-、かみ、あ.げる、-あ.げる、あ.がる、-あ.がる、あ.がり、-あ.がり、のぼ.る、のぼ.り、のぼ.せる、のぼ.す、よ.す	A <em>magic wand</em> standing on<strong> above</strong> the floor.	The <em>divining rod</em> is<strong> above</strong> the <em>floor</em>.	Water Faucet is<strong> ABOVE</strong> the Ground.	Whoa, that <em>magic wand</em> is<strong> above</strong> the <em>floor</em> by itself!	"I hold my hand<strong> above</strong> my broom as I cry ""UP!""."		
下		below	Here we see our famous miraculous <i>magic wand</i> hanging, all on its own, <b>below</b> the <i>ceiling</i>, as you probably already guessed would happen. In addition to giving us two new kanji, the two shapes given in this and the preceding frame also serve to fix the use of the primitives for <i>ceiling</i> and <i>floor</i>, by drawing our attention successively to the line standing above and <b>below</b> the primitive element to which it is related.		3	51	50	3	カ、ゲ	した、しも、もと、さ.げる、さ.がる、くだ.る、くだ.り、くだ.す、-くだ.す、くだ.さる、お.ろす、お.りる	Roots are<strong> below</strong> the ground.	A <em>magic wand</em> hanging<strong> below</strong> the ceiling.	"Peeing off a cliff ""Watch out<strong> BELOW</strong>!""."	A T with it's wang<strong> below</strong>.	This time the DIVINING ROD has been pushed<strong> below</strong> the ceiling deforming its handle.		
卓		eminent	The word <b>eminent</b> suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do - given the primitives of a <i>magic wand</i> and a <i>sunflower</i> - is to think of the world's most <b>eminent</b> magician as one who uses a <i>sunflower</i> for a <i>magic wand</i> (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love).		8	52	51	3	タク		The most<strong> eminent</strong> magician is he who learned to use his <em>magic wand early</em> in life.	The world's most <strong>eminent</strong> sourcerer, Harry Potter, used his <em>magic wand early</em> in life.	The<strong> eminent</strong> sunflower is the one that stands above the others.	"When a car ( 車 ) <a href=""../v4/286.html"">car</a> (#286 車) loses a wheel, disaster is<strong> eminent</strong>."	The world's most<strong> eminent</strong> fortune-teller is also the earliest of all. He produces his predictions amazingly fast.		
朝		morning	On the right we see the <i>moon</i> fading off into the first light of <b>morning</b>, and to the left, the <i>mist</i> that falls to give nature a shower to prepare it for the coming heat. If you can think of the <i>moon</i> tilting over to spill <i>mist</i> on your garden, you should have no trouble remembering which of all the elements in this story are to serve as primitives for constructing the character.		12	53	52	3	チョウ	あさ	There is mist as the moon fades away in the<strong> morning</strong>.	"<strong>Morning</strong> has come ""ten"" hours ""early""!!! The ""moon"" is still in the sky!"	In the<strong> morning</strong>, god picks the <em>sun</em> up to the sky with two <em>needles</em> (because it's too hot to touch by hands) to replace the <em>moon</em>.	The<strong> morning</strong> <em>mist</em> is the <em>moon</em>'s parting tears–sprinkling <em>ten early flowers</em> with dew when she leaves the sky each day.	In the<strong> morning</strong> the <em>mist</em> and <em>moon</em> fades away.		
嘲		derision	The bad feeling created by words spoken in <b>derision</b> often leaves a bad taste in the <i>mouth</i> of the one who speaks them, kind of like the foul aftertaste that follows a night before of too much of the wrong stuff - or what we call <i>morning mouth</i>.		15	54	2155	3	チョウ、トウ	あざけ.る	When I wake up, I am always late, so I hurry to work. With a bad case of perpetual morning breath, I am the subject of<strong> derision</strong> at my office whenever I open my mouth.	If <em>morning</em> breath emanates from your <em>mouth</em>, you are subject to<strong> derision</strong>!	Truly the epic mother-in-law who, at the very crack of <em>morning</em>, already possesses a <em>mouth</em> full of<strong> derision</strong>.	Your <em>mouth</em> is full of<strong> derision</strong> in the <em>morning</em> because you're grumpy.	When I opened my <em>mouth</em> to suggest an early <em>morning</em> meeting, my suggestion was met with<strong> derision</strong>.		
只		only	"When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best way to get an image it to recall some common but suggestive phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think of the expression ""it's the <b>only</b> one of its kind."" Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-manlike creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic <i>mouth</i> and two wee <i>animal legs</i>."		5	55	53	4	シ	ただ	Imagine an animal with<strong> only</strong> a <em>mouth</em> and <em>leg</em>s.	My girlfriend insists that the <em>only</em> thing I want from her is what's between her legs.. She's drawn me this pictograph to demonstrate. It's a <em>head</em> and two legs spread apart.. I explain that I also love her breasts, and then she smacks me in the face. I'll never understand women.. (I keep failing this kanji, hopefully this silly story will help me!).	<strong>Only</strong> your mouth runs faster than your legs.	Men<strong> only</strong> want that mouth between the legs.	<strong>Tada</strong>!… <strong>SHE</strong> is the<strong> only</strong> animal with<strong> only</strong> a <em>mouth</em> on <em>legs</em> and no body! (Kun reading tada, ON reading SHI).		
貝		shellfish	To remember the primitive elements that make up this kanji, an <i>eye</i> and <i>animal legs</i>, you might be tempted to think of it as a pictograph of a <b>shellfish</b> with its ridged shell at the top and two little <i>legs</i> sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish <b>shellfish</b> with a single, gigantic <i>eye</i> roaming the beaches on its slender little <i>legs</i>, scaring the wits out of the sunbathers.	* When used as a primitive, in addition to <i>shells</i>, the meanings <i>oyster</i> and <i>clam</i> will often come in handy.	7	56	54	4	バイ	かい	<em>Eye</em> thought I saw a<strong> shellfish</strong> <em>legging</em> it down the beach!	Stare at the<strong> shellfish</strong>, it looks like an eye with legs.	Remove the <em>eyes</em> and the <em>legs</em>, and a<strong> shellfish</strong> tastes great!	The <strong>guy</strong> couldn't <strong>BUY</strong> any<strong> shellfish</strong> which had one giant <em>eye</em> and walked on <em>animal legs</em>, so he went out in his <strong>kay</strong>ak to catch some. (Kun readings are kai or gai, ON reading is BAI).	<strong>SHELLFISH</strong> look like big <em>eyes</em> with <em>legs</em>.		
唄		pop song	"There is a lot of money to be made of one's <b>songs</b> are ""<b>pop</b>ular."" This is depicted here as a stream of <i>clams</i> spewing out of the <i>mouth</i> of someone performing a <b>pop song</b>."		10	57	2178	4	バイ	うた、うた.う	The new generation of <strong>pop songs</strong> have no depth. They just <em>mouth</em> empty lyrics to get <em>money</em>. Not like the <strong>pop songs</strong> of my day.	A new way for sluts to use their mouths to make alot of money.	Out of the <em>mouth</em> comes a<strong> pop song</strong> and in rolls the <em>money</em>.	Critics of popular music often complain that pop music doesn't require technique. They say that any idiot who opens his <em>mouth</em> and sings a<strong> pop song</strong> will make <em>money</em>.	Think Milli Vanilli - Guys <em>mouthing</em><strong> pop song</strong>s just to make <em>money</em>.		
貞		upright	Now take the last primitive, the <i>shellfish</i>, and set a <i>magic wand</i> over it, and you have the kanji for <b>upright</b>. After all, the <i>clam</i> and the <i>oyster</i> are incapable of walking <b>upright</b>. It would take a magician with his <i>wand</i> to pull off such a feat - which is precisely what we have in this kanji.		9	58	55	4	テイ	さだ	A <em>magic wand</em> is needed to make a <em>clam</em> stand<strong> upright</strong>.	Just the thought of my <em>magic wand</em> on her <em>clam</em> makes my <em>magic wand</em> stand<strong> upright</strong>.	"貞 【てい】 (n) (1) firm adherence to one's principles; (2) chastity (of a woman) what this has to do with ""upright""… not sure. but heres a story for CHASTITY: ""a magician uses his MAGIC WAND to shut the crotch of a maiden as tight as a CLAM, to protect her CHASTITY""."	To get the <em>shellfish</em> to stand<strong> upright</strong>, just poke it with a <em>magic wand</em>!	An<strong> UPRIGHT</strong> person is <em>above</em> ( 上 ) petty disputes, and always holds their head <em>up</em> ( 上 ). Since they live on principle, they are as hard or firm as a <em>shell</em> in their beliefs of what is right and what is wrong. They are wise, because they find the pearls of wisdom in the <em>shells</em> of life; 童貞 (virginity); 不貞 (unfaithful); 貞はる (harp too long on a subject); 貞淑 (chastity, virtue); 貞女 (virtuous woman); 不貞寝 (stay in bed out of spite); .		
員		employee	How do we get a <i>mouth</i> over a <i>shellfish</i> to mean an <b>employee</b>? Simple. Just remember the advice new <b>employees</b> get about keeping their <i>mouths</i> shut and doing their job, and then make that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white collar workers scurrying around with <i>clams</i> pinched to their <i>mouths</i>.		10	59	56	4	イン		An<strong> employee</strong> (<strong>member</strong> of the company) has to clam up his mouth if he wants keep the job!	An<strong> employee</strong> is basically a shellfish with a mouth.	An<strong> employee</strong> is a worker. They lend their <em>mouth</em> ( 口 ) to spread a message & sell products; <em>eyes</em> ( 目 ) to watch competitors & find customers; and <em>eight</em> ( 八 ) hours a day. Alt., an<strong> employee</strong> is a <em>shell</em> ( 貝 ) in the ocean of a company; it looks up to the boss's <em>mouth</em> ( 口 ) for orders. 医員 (doctor); 一員 (member); 駅員 (station attendant); 委員 (committee member); 会社員 (company<strong> employee</strong>); 海員 (sailor); 楽員 (band member); 期間契約社員 (fixed term contractor).	An<strong> employee</strong> is not a robot (Calculon's friend), he's got a <em>mouth</em> to feed. Pay him more than a few <em>clams</em>!	<strong>Employee</strong>s work and earn clams so that they can feed their mouths.		
貼		post a bill	The key word in this frame has do with <b>posting bills</b> to a billboard. In this case, the billboard is standing at the exit to a Chinese restaurant displaying the latest alternative to the tradition <i>fortune-telling</i> cookies. Look closely and you will see rows of leftover shells of <i>clams</i> with little slips of paper sticking out of them <b>posted</b> to the billboard.		12	60	2736	4	テン、チョウ	は.る、つ.く	Fortune teller writes your fortune on a piece of paper and tells you to<strong> affix</strong> it to a shell and throw into the ocean for it to come true.

"To prevent confusion with <a href=""../v4/1303.html"">affixed</a> (#1303 附) I changed this to ""paste (v.)"" or ""cut and paste"" because it is the character for pasting in a PC and in graphic design.

I gots <strong>a fix</strong> for your current bad luck: just pass some extra <em>clams</em> over to the <em>fortune teller</em>, and they will make sure you have a very bright fate instore.	"To make cash (<em>clams</em>) the gypsy <strong>affixed a note / posted a bill</strong> to a billboard advertising her <em>fortune telling</em> services (contrast with <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/673"">put up (a notice)</a> (#673 掲))."

見		see	The elements that compose the character for <b>see</b> are the <i>eye</i> firmly fixed to a pair of <i>human legs</i>. Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character....		7	61	57	4	ケン	み.る、み.える、み.せる	As a primitive, this is Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc. (the giant <em>eyeball</em> with <em>legs</em>…) Makes for <em>easy</em> stories later on.	Eyes and legs are all you need to<strong> see</strong> the world.	Men's <em>eyes</em> open wide when they<strong> see</strong> the <em>legs</em> of a beautiful woman. (Alternatively, women's <em>eyes</em> open wide when they<strong> see</strong> the <em>legs</em> of a handsome guy ;) ).	The large <em>eye</em> on <em>human legs</em> <strong>see</strong>s all!	I<strong> see</strong> best when I am walking!		
児		newborn babe	"The top part of the kanji in this frame, you will remember, is the character for <i>olden times</i>, those <i>days</i> so old they needed a <i>walking stick</i> to get around. Western mythical imagination has old ""Father Time"" leaning on his sickle with a <b>newborn babe</b> crawling around his <i>legs</i>, the idea being that the circle of birth and-death goes on. This is the first of three times that the kanji for <i>olden times</i> will appear as a primitive element in another kanji, so try to make the most of it."		7	62	58	4	ジ、ニ、ゲイ	こ、-こ、-っこ	In the <em>olden times</em>, a<strong> newborn babe</strong> came out <em>leg</em>s first.	In the <em>olden times</em>, a<strong> newborn babe</strong> came from between the <em>leg</em>s. Now we have cesarean section. [modified rakutenka's story].	In <em>olden times</em><strong> newborn babe</strong>s were strapped to their mothers' backs, leaving both their legs dangling.	The man from <strong>olden times</strong> has been reincarnated with a new pair of <strong>human legs</strong>.	A<strong> newborn babe</strong> is an 18 year commitment that will have you <em>running</em> for <em>olden times</em>!		
元		beginning	"""In the <b>beginning</b>..."" starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made <i>two</i> of them, man and woman. While we presume she made <i>two</i> of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only <i>two</i> and a pair of <i>human legs</i> come to the kanji that means <b>beginning</b>."		4	63	59	4	ゲン、ガン	もと	In the<strong> beginning</strong> were just <em>two</em> who walked on <em>human legs</em>.	"In the<strong> beginning</strong> God created woman, and God asked her how she liked his work. Woman replied, ""Well, you know how I have <em>two</em> eyes, <em>two</em> arms, <em>two legs</em>… it seems redundant to have three breasts. It would look more symmetrical with <em>two</em>."" God nodded, and the middle breast fell off… and it was good. Woman picked up the breast and said, ""Thank you, God! But what do I do with this useless boob?"" And God created man. That's why the women today only have <em>two</em> boobs to match their <em>two human legs</em>."	Every journey begins with your two legs.	"Grandpa Woody always began stories from his youth with ""In the<strong> beginning</strong>, when I had <em>two</em> <em>legs</em>…""."	In the<strong> beginning</strong> we start out with nothing but our own two legs.		
頁		page	"What we have to do here is turn a <i>shellfish</i> into a <b>page</b> of a book. The <i>one</i> at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact only <i>one</i> <b>page</b>. Imagine a title printed on the shell of an <i>oyster</i>, let us say ""Pearl of Wisdom,"" and then open the quaint book to its <i>one</i> and only <b>page</b>, on which you find a single, radiant <i>drop of</i> wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of nature."	* As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a <i>head</i> (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for <i>head</i> (Frame 1549).	9	64	60	4	ケツ	ぺえじ、おおがい、かしら	A <em>shellfish</em> carrying a<strong> page</strong> balanced on its <em>head</em>.	<em>One</em> <em>drop</em> of ink from a <em>shellfish</em> can fill a whole<strong> page</strong>.	A <em>shellfish</em> dangles from the <em>ceiling</em> Mission-Impossible style, desperate to recover the<strong> page</strong> of revealing images that were taken from him.	"頁岩 , 頁 , <a href=""../v4/60.html"">page</a> (#60 頁) ケツ, ページ … Parts: 一 , 丶, 自 , ハor 一 , 丶, 貝 (cf: 順番 , お願い , 頭 , 頂く , etc.) … Tip: This is a never used Kanji, but you are going to see it a few hundred more times in RTK as a primitive. Here's something that I figured out way too late. This is <em>ALWAYS</em> <em>ALWAYS</em> on the right hand side (RHS) of the characters it is a part of. <em>Always</em>.. Learn this primitive cold, and remember, always on the RHS."	<em>One</em><strong> page</strong> may not seem like much, but if it contains <em>drop</em> of wisdom, it is worth the <em>clams</em> you <em>shell</em>ed out for it.		
頑		stubborn	"This character refers to the block<i>headed</i>, persistent <b>stubbornness</b> of one who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the <i>beginning</i>, without letting anything that comes up along the way alter things in the least. The explanation makes ""sense,"" but is hard to remember because the word ""<i>beginning</i> ""is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all <b>stubbornness</b> goes back to the <i>beginning</i>, with two brothers each <b>stubbornly</b> defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled <i>heads</i>, each vying for the favors of heaven, a <b>stubborn</b> grimace on their faces. No wonder something unfortunate happened!"		13	65	61	4	ガン	かたく	A<strong> stubborn</strong> person in the <em>beginning</em> gets something into their <em>head</em> and can't change their mind.	Picture a<strong> STUBBORN</strong> schoolboy, with his arms crossed and his book still open to the BEGINNING PAGE. Despite the teacher telling him to turn the page, he refuses and keeps his book on the BEGINNING PAGE.	He's so<strong> stubborn</strong>, he won't read past the beginning page!	<strong>Stubborn</strong>ness begins in the head.	I tend to be<strong> STUBBORN</strong> if the first (<em>beginning</em>) <em>page</em> of a book is not good.		
凡		mediocre	"While we refer to something insignificant as a ""<i>drop</i> in the bucket,"" the kanji for <b>mediocre</b> suggests the image of a ""<i>drop</i> in the <i>wind</i>."""		3	66	62	4	ボン、ハン	およ.そ、おうよ.そ、すべ.て	Is there anything as<strong> mediocre</strong> as a drop of piss in the wind?	A <em>drop</em> of breeze is naught but a<strong> mediocre</strong> <em>wind</em>.	A drop of rain in the wind… what a<strong> mediocre</strong> rainy season…	<strong>Mediocre</strong> people hide under the table.	All we are is Dust in the Wind- a great example of a<strong> mediocre</strong> song.		
負		defeat	Above we have the condensed form of <i>bound up</i>, and below the familiar <i>shellfish</i>. Now imagine two <i>oysters</i> engaged in <i>shell</i>-to-<i>shell</i> combat, the one who is <b>defeated</b> being <i>bound and gagged</i> with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The <i>bound shellfish</i> thus becomes the symbol for <b>defeat</b>.		9	67	63	4	フ	ま.ける、ま.かす、お.う	<em>Tied up</em>, the <em>shellfish</em> had to accept<strong> defeat</strong>!	The <em>shellfish</em> admitted <strong>defeat</strong> when they placed a <em>hook</em> on top of his head.	<strong>Defeat</strong> is defined by a shellfish in binds.	A <em>shellfish bound up</em> in a fisherman's net has been<strong> defeat</strong>ed.	If you are<strong> DEFEAT</strong>ED you are BOUND into slavery and the world will not be your OYSTER.		
万		ten thousand	"Japanese counts higher numbers in units of <b>ten thousand</b>, unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read ""four <b>ten-thousands</b>"" by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to <i>bind up</i> a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for <i>one</i> and <i>bound up</i> naturally come to form <b>ten thousand</b>. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for <i>bound up</i> in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together."		3	68	64	4	マン、バン	よろず	I <em>bound</em><strong> ten thousand</strong> dollars together and hid it under the <em>floor</em>.	IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!	It looks like a T and an H put together.	"We have ""one"" at the top and if you turn the kanji 90 degrees you will see arabic 4 shich means it has four zeros in front of it!"	Think of Tao:<strong> ten thousand</strong> things are all <em>bound up</em> into <em>one</em>.		
句		phrase	By combining the two primitives <i>bound up</i> and <i>mouth</i>, we can easily see how this character can get the meaning of a <b>phrase</b>. After all, a <b>phrase</b> is nothing more than a number of words <i>bound up</i> tightly and neatly so that they will fit in your <i>mouth</i>.		5	69	65	4	ク		Some Japanese <strong>phrase</strong>s are difficult to <em>wrap</em> your <em>mouth</em> around.	A bound mouth cannot utter a single<strong> phrase</strong>.	A<strong> phrase</strong> is a bunch of bound up words coming out of a mouth.	I use my <em>mouth</em> to <em>bind</em> words together, thus forming a<strong> phrase</strong> or sentence ( 句 ).	<em>Bind</em> your <em>mouth</em> in case the wrong<strong> phrase</strong> gets out.		
肌		texture	"Ever notice how the <b>texture</b> of your face and hands is affected by the <i>wind</i>? A day's skiing or sailing makes them rough and dry, and in need of a good soft cream to soothe the burn. So whenever a <i>part of the body</i> gets exposed to the <i>wind</i>, its <b>texture</b> is affected. (If it is any help, the Latin word hiding inside <b>texture</b> connotes how something is ""to the touch."")"		6	70	66	4	キ	はだ	When you expose your <em>flesh</em> to the <em>wind</em> it gets <strong>textured</strong>: goosebumps!	The <em>moon</em>'s lack of <em>wind</em> preserves its<strong> texture</strong>.	Because the <em>moon</em> has no <em>wind</em> the<strong> texture</strong> of it's cratered surface never changes or erodes.	The Moon And The Wind Create The Sea's Wavey <strong>Texture</strong>!	A month of wind changes the<strong> texture</strong> of your skin.		
旬		decameron	There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block often days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classical phrase, <b>decameron</b>, whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of ten <i>days</i> taken by a band of people - that is, a group of people <i>bound together</i> for the <i>days</i> of the <b>decameron</b>.		6	71	67	4	ジュン、シュン		"Hesig should be BOUND for a DAY (or maybe 10 days - a<strong> decameron</strong>) for calling this Kanji<strong> DECAMERON</strong>. See <a href=""../v4/809.html"">martyrdom</a> (#809 殉)."	"<strong>Hint:</strong> <em>Here's info from Wikipedia regarding why this kanji exists, which helped me remember it:</em> [Japan also divides the month roughly into three 10-day periods. Each is called a jun ( 旬 ). The first is jōjun ( 上旬 ); the second, chūjun ( 中旬 ); the last, gejun ( 下旬 ). These are frequently used to indicate approximate times, for example, ""the temperatures are typical of the jōjun of April""; ""a vote on a bill is expected during the gejun of this month.""]."	What the fuck?	If you bind up ten days, you get a<strong> decameron</strong>.	For producing Titanic, James<strong> deCameron</strong> should be bound for 10 days.		
勺		ladle	If you want to <i>bind up drops</i> of anything - water, soup, lemonade - you use something to scoop these <i>drops</i> up, which is what we call a <b>ladle</b>. See the last <i>drop</i> left inside the <b>ladle</b>?		3	72	68	4	シャク		A<strong> ladle</strong> binds drops together.	Forget about the primative 'bound up'. Imagine instead the shape of a<strong> ladle</strong> and holding it upside down to drink the last DROP (of water).	The last <em>drop</em> stays <em>bound</em> to the<strong> LADLE</strong>.	I'm bound and determined to get that last drop with this<strong> ladle</strong>!	A<strong> ladle</strong> holding a tiny fart.		
的		bull's eye	"The elements <i>white bird</i> and <i>ladle</i> easily suggest the image of a <b>bull's eye</b> if you imagine a rusty old <i>ladle</i> with a <b>bull's eye</b> painted on it in the form of a tiny <i>white bird</i>, who lets out a little ""peep"" every time you hit the target."		8	73	69	4	テキ	まと	I managed to hit the bull's eye by throwing my white ladle.	"A <em>white</em>, <em>bound up</em>, <em>drop</em> in the center is the bull's eye. (why Heisig had to use ""ladle"" instead of the original two primitives that make up ""ladle"" I'll never understand!)."	"You're outside at a BBQ making the white sauce to go with whats on the grill. You lift the ladle to your lips. Right after you close your eyes to take a taste, a drop of white bird shit falls into the ladle - "" Bull's Eye! "" the bird says. Not seeing the incident, you proceed to taste your 'white sauce'."	He scooped out the <strong>bull's eye</strong> with a <em>white laddle</em>.	A <em>white</em>, <em>bound up</em>, <em>drop</em> in the center is the <strong>bull's eye</strong>.		
首		neck	"Reading this kanji from the top down, we have: <i>horns</i> . . . <i>nose</i>. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head hanging on the den wall, with its great <i>horns</i> and long <i>nose</i>. Now while we would speak of cutting off a moose's ""head"" to hang on the wall, the Japanese speak of cutting off its <b>neck</b>. It's all a matter of how you look at it. Anyway, if you let the word <b>neck</b> conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g <b>neck</b> hanging over the fireplace, whose <i>horns</i> you use for a coat-rack and whose <i>nose</i> has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character. Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first introduced the element for <i>horns</i>: that they can never be left floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent that from happening, as is the case here."		9	74	70	4	シュ	くび	The V shape is your <strong>neck</strong> on top of your collar bone, or the straight line. <em>Yourself</em>, or the rest of your body is below that!	The mooses<strong> neck</strong> supports it's big horns and long nose.	One has a strong<strong> NECK</strong> if one can carry HORNS on ONESELF.	There are no goddamn animal legs in the Kanji for<strong> neck</strong>. Stop thinking there are animal legs in the Kanji for<strong> neck</strong>. There are NONE!	With horns on oneself, you need a strong<strong> neck</strong>.		
乙		fish guts	"The kanji shown here actually represents the ""second"" position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternate way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among its many other meanings are ""pure,"" ""tasteful,"" ""quaint,"" and - get this! - <b>fish guts</b>. Since it is a pictograph of a fishhook, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word."	* We will keep <i>fishhook</i> as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples follow.	1	75	71	5	オツ、イツ	おと-、きのと	This is a fish hook, that pulls out the<strong> fishguts</strong>.	You cut a fish in a z shape on the belly to make it easier to open the fish and rip out its <strong>fish guts</strong> silly!	"""Knife goes in, guts come out"" (-Bart Simpson's mantra as he guts fish in ""30 Minutes Over Tokyo""). To be more specific: first, cut a 乙 -shape in the belly of the fish, <strong>second</strong>, pull the<strong> fishguts</strong> out. (Note that the most common meaning of this kanji is not 'fishguts' as Heisig connotates, but 'second')."	Fishgutz.	"Really this will rarely be seen as<strong> fishguts</strong> as a Kanji, usually it's 2nd party, or latter, generally always meaning 2nd in some way. It's easy to remember this as ""2nd"" since it looks like a 2. Then just remember it's a fishhook primitive like any other kanji that changes it's meaning as a primitive."		
乱		riot	"In a <b>riot</b>, manners are laid aside and tempers get short, even in so courtesy-conscious a land as Japan. This kanji shows what happens to a <b>rioting</b> <i>tongue</i>: it gets ""barbed"" like a <i>fishhook</i>, and sets to attacking the opposition, to <i>hook</i> them as it were."		7	76	72	5	ラン、ロン	みだ.れる、みだ.る、みだ.す、みだ、おさ.める、わた.る	The<strong> riot</strong> police broke up the<strong> riot</strong> by dragging the<strong> riot</strong>ers away by their <em>tongues</em> with <em>fishooks</em>.	A <em>tongue</em> with a <em>hook</em> can cause a<strong> riot</strong>.	If my daughter took her <em>tongue</em> and pierced it with a <em>fishhook</em>, that would cause her mother and I to<strong> riot</strong>!	During a <em>riot</em> in a totalitarian country, the leftist's <em>tongues</em> are <em>fishhooked</em> by the police ( a way for me to remember that tongue is on the left of the kanji).	<strong>Riot</strong>ers are punks with fish hooks in their tongues.		
直		straightaway	Begin with the top two primitives, <i>needle</i> and <i>eye</i>. Together they represent the <i>eye of a needle</i>. Below them is a <i>fishhook</i> that has been <b>straightened out</b> and its barb removed so that it can pass through the <i>eye of the needle</i>.		8	77	73	5	チョク、ジキ、ジカ	ただ.ちに、なお.す、-なお.す、なお.る、なお.き、す.ぐ	If you get a needle in your eye that is hooked in there, get to a hospital<strong> straightaway</strong>.	I caught a freaky creature with ten eyes on my fish hook, so I threw it back<strong> straightaway</strong>.	"""Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a <em>needle</em> in my <em>eye</em>""… and sit on a <em>fish hook</em> if I ever tell a lie! Slight variant on what kids say<strong> straightaway</strong> if their word is put in doubt."	Ten eyes knew<strong> straightaway</strong> that there is something wrong with the hook.	The hook goes<strong> straightaway</strong> through the eye of a needle.		
具		tool	Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's <b>tools</b> of all sorts, each equipped with its own <i>eye</i> so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart.		8	78	74	5	グ	そな.える、つぶさ.に	Keep an eye on your<strong> tool</strong>s while you work at the table.	One<strong> tool</strong> nobody should be without - a Mordor-type eye that floats over the workbench. It jerks around, monitoring all who come near, and if anyone so much as removes a stapler from the bench - ZAP.	You need a strong<strong> tool</strong> to remove the legs from a shellfish.	You need a strong a<strong> tool</strong> to separate the legs from a shellfish.	Like my shop teacher always said… In order to use any<strong> tool</strong> at your <em>workbench</em> you must first make sure to wear your safety goggles to protect your <em>eyes</em>.		
真		true	Here again we meet the composite element, <i>eye of the needle</i>, which here combines with <i>tool</i> to give us a measure of what is <b>true</b> and what is not.		10	79	75	5	シン	ま、ま-、まこと	A compass is a <em>tool</em> with a <em>needle</em> on top that points to<strong> true</strong> north.	<em>Ten</em> <em>tools</em> are all a<strong> true</strong> craftsman needs.	It's<strong> true</strong> that I got a needle stuck in my eye once. Luckily, we had a tool to pull the needle out from my eye.<strong> True</strong> story.	Ten eyes working together are the best tools to see what's<strong> true</strong>.	Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a <em>needle</em> in my <em>eye</em> is a <em>tool</em> used by children to affirm what they said as being<strong> true</strong>.		
工		craft	The pictograph of an I beam, like the kind used in heavy construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the character for <b>craft</b> in general.	* As a primitive element, the key word retains the meaning of <i>craft</i> and also takes on the related meanings of <i>I beam</i> and <i>artificial</i>.	3	80	76	5	コウ、ク、グ		I consider<strong> craft</strong> to be one of the harder primitives to use in stories so I've personified it as Bender the<strong> craft</strong>y robot from Futurama who was designed to bend I-beams.	I<strong> craft</strong>y.	Icraft, beautifully<strong> craft</strong>ed by apple!	I-beams are used to<strong> CRAFT</strong> skyscrapers.	I<strong> CRAFT</strong>ed an <em>artificial I-beam</em>.		
左		left	"By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get: <i>by one's side</i> . . . <i>craft</i>. Conveniently, the <b>left</b> has traditionally been considered the ""sinister"" <i>side</i>, where dark and occult <i>crafts</i> are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the <b>left</b> and is longer than the first."		5	81	77	5	サ、シャ	ひだり	The<strong> LEFT</strong> <em>side</em> of my brain <em>posesses</em> the faculties needed for logical <em>crafts</em>, like engineering.	The<strong> left</strong> <em>side</em> of my brain, is for <em>crafts</em>.	"<strong>FOR THOSE ABOUT TO PUZZLE OVER THE CHANGING STROKE ORDER, IT'S THIS SIMPLE:</strong> Look at the second primitive! Here, the first stroke of <em>by one's side</em> should match the first stroke of <em>craft</em> so that the stroke direction alternates in writing. So 左 is written horizontal, vertical, horizontal… 右 is written vertical, horizontal, vertical… 有 is vertical, horizontal, vertical… etc. (The ONLY exception to this rule comes with elbow [<a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/743"">masculine/male</a> (#743 雄) 雄 ], which is written horizontal, vertical, vertical(ish)…)."	"To remember which one is right/left, think ""(l)Eft"", as it contains the katakana ""e""."	Sinister craft is done with the<strong> left</strong> hand.		
右		right	When thinking of the key word <b>right</b>, in order to avoid confusion with the previous frame, take advantage of the double meaning here, too. Imagine a little <i>mouth</i> hanging down by your <i>side</i> - like a little voice of conscience - telling you the <b>right</b> thing to do. Here the second stroke should reach out to the <b>right</b> and be drawn slightly longer than the first.		5	82	78	5	ウ、ユウ	みぎ	The<strong> right</strong> hand is for putting food in your <em>mouth</em>. (The other hand is for ass-wiping!). 左右 (さゆう) : left and<strong> right</strong>, influence, control, domination; 右 (みぎ) :<strong> right</strong> hand side.	The<strong> right</strong> <em>side</em> of my brain is for <em>speaking</em>.	Always keep your<strong> right</strong> to free speech (mouth) by your side!	<em>By my side</em> is a big <em>mouth</em> who thinks they're always<strong> right</strong>.	A voice of reason <em>by your side</em> steers you<strong> right</strong>.		
有		possess	The picture here is of someone with a slab of <i>meat</i> dangling <i>by the side</i>, perhaps from a belt or rope tied around the waist. Think of it as an evil spirit in <b>possession</b> of one's soul, who can be exorcized only by allowing fresh <i>meat</i> to hang <i>by one's side</i> until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon departs. Take careful note of the stroke order.		6	83	79	5	ユウ、ウ	あ.る	<strong>Possess</strong>ed by the Earth's gravity, the moon stays by its side.	By my side I<strong> POSSESS</strong> a <em> moon of flesh</em>, better known as your big ass!	To<strong> possess</strong> = have or own something. In the fight for survival in prehistoric times, the most important thing to<strong> possess</strong> was meat by your side which could be eaten at any time. Imagine a caveman after a hunt having meat by his side.	The moon stood by my side: I was<strong> possess</strong>ed, a lunatic.	With the moon at my side I transform into a werewolf. Oh no, I am<strong> possess</strong>ed.		
賄		bribe	To the left we have the primitive for a <i>shellfish</i>, and to the right the kanji we just learned for <i>possess</i>. Keep the connotation of the last frame for the word <i>possess</i>, and now expand your image of <i>shells</i> to include the ancient value they had as money (a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now one who is <i>possessed</i> by <i>shells</i> is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to <b>bribe</b> with a few extra <i>shells</i>.		13	84	80	5	ワイ	まかな.う	To<strong> bribe</strong> someone, money is a necessary possession.	If you possess enough shellfish, you can<strong> bribe</strong> anyone.	In order to<strong> bribe</strong> me you will have to give me all the <em>clams</em> you <em>possess</em>.	A <strong>shellfish</strong> is not the 'right' <strong>possession</strong> to<strong> bribe</strong> with. (It's on the left).	If money is what possesses you, you will accept many<strong> bribe</strong>s.		
貢		tribute	A <b>tribute</b> has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paid freely and <i>money</i> collected by coercion. Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard-earned <i>money</i>. Little wonder that this ancient <i>craft</i> of getting <i>money</i> by calling it a <b>tribute</b> has given way to a name closer to how it feels to those who pay it: a tax.		10	85	81	5	コウ、ク	みつ.ぐ	"""This next song is a<strong> TRIBUTE</strong> to a little SHELLFISH friend of mine who was tragically crushed by an I-shaped table.""."	<strong>Tribute</strong> is the craft of raising money.	I gladly pay my<strong> tribute</strong> to the tax collector: but what he doesn't know is that this is carely <em>craft</em>ed <em>money</em> - counterfeit!	"<strong>Tribute</strong> is another form of taxation - a <em>craft</em>y way of collecting ""<em>clams</em>"" (money). 貢献 (こうけん) : contribution, services; 西貢 さいごん Saigon."	We must pay<strong> tribute</strong> to the crafty shellfish who always appears in our kanji.		
項		paragraph	"To the right we see a <i>head</i> and to the left an element that means <i>craft</i>. When we think of a <b>paragraph</b>, we immediately think of a <i>heading</i> device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate <i>heads</i> often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer's <i>craft</i>. Hence, we define <b>paragraphing</b> as the ""<i>heading craft</i>"" to remember this character."		12	86	82	5	コウ	うなじ	To write a<strong> paragraph</strong> is the <em>craft</em> of grouping sentences on a <em>page</em>.	To <em>craft</em> a <em>page</em> well, we need<strong> paragraph</strong>s.	Page and craft = pacraft -> paracraft; said properly as<strong> paragraph</strong>.	Well, I tried using craft and headings and pages and none of it stuck, so: Reading a block of text that isn't broken down into<strong> paragraph</strong>s makes me want to hit myself in the head with an I-beam.	A well CRAFTED PAGE is full of beautiful<strong> PARAGRAPH</strong>S.		
刀		sword	Although this character no longer looks very much like a <b>sword</b>, it does have some resemblance to the handle of the <b>sword</b>. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us keep make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji.	* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a <i>dagger</i>. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing <i>saber</i>, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801).	2	87	83	5	トウ	かたな、そり	This<strong> SWORD</strong> is so sharp, it can cut the top part of カ off in カタナ.	If you look really close this kanji looks like a person bending over touching the ground Waiting for someone to put there<strong> sword</strong> in his ass!	Samurai carry two<strong> sword</strong>s on their belt: a curved katana and a straighter, shorter wakizashi.	Looks like the handle on a pirate cutlass, a kind of<strong> sword</strong>.	"Note : this is the kanji for the famous Japanese<strong> sword</strong>, also pronounced かたな (katana). As a primitive when it is compressed on the right of a kanji, its meaning becomes ""saber"". In that case I like to associate the image of a ninja, making sure to keep it distinct from the ""samurai"". The samurai would be the historical japanese warrior, while the ninja would be the more stealthy character popularised through modern martial arts movies."		
刃		blade	Think of using a <i>dagger</i> as a razor <b>blade</b>, and it shouldn't be hard to imagine cutting yourself. See the little <i>drop of</i> blood clinging to the <b>blade</b>?		3	88	84	5	ジン、ニン	は、やいば、き.る	The part of a <em>sword</em> where a <em>drop of blood</em> can usually be found is the<strong> blade</strong>.	<strong>A drop of</strong> blood on the<strong> blade</strong> of my sword.	Imagine<strong> Blade</strong> (Wesley Snipes) wiping the <em>drops</em> of blood from his <em>sword</em> after killing some vampires.	How do you know it is a real <em>sword</em>? There is a <em>drop</em> of blood on the <strong>blade</strong>.	There's a <em>drop</em> of blood on the<strong> blade</strong> of the <em>sword</em>.		
切		cut	To the right we see the <i>dagger</i> and next to it the number <i>seven</i> whose primitive meaning we decided would be <i>diced</i> (Frame 7). It is hard to think of <b>cutting</b> anything with a knife without imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say that he has had too much to drink at a party, grabs a <i>dagger</i> lying on the mantelpiece and starts <i>dicing</i> up everything insight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to the furniture and the carpets....		4	89	85	5	セツ、サイ	き.る、-き.る、き.り、-き.り、-ぎ.り、き.れる、-き.れる、き.れ、-き.れ、-ぎ.れ	The seven samurai used their swords to<strong> cut</strong> their opponents.	Seven swords<strong> cut</strong> better than one.	The <em>seven</em> samurai used their <em>swords</em> to<strong> cut</strong> vegetables. (Easier to remember if it's a little silly. Imagine the seven samurai flailing about the kitchen dangerously swinging their katanas about, to<strong> cut</strong> stuff up for dinner.).	"Actors filming ""The Seven Samurai"" respond to the director's command, ""CUT!"" by wielding their swords."	Be careful!!! Snow White has gone insane and<strong> CUT</strong> up the SEVEN dwarfs with a DAGGER.		
召		seduce	"A <i>sword</i> or <i>dagger</i> posed over a <i>mouth</i> is how the character for ""beckoning"" is written. The related but less tame key word <b>seduce</b> was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the - how shall we put it? - Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is <b>seducing</b> the small round one or vice versa.)"	* The primitive meaning remains the same: <i>seduce</i>. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image.	5	90	86	5	ショウ	め.す	"A man is easily<strong> seduce</strong>d by a mouth to his ""sword.""."	When you<strong> seduce</strong> a girl you can put your sword in her mouth.	To<strong> seduce</strong> is to make a <em>sword</em> of one's <em>mouth</em>.	To<strong> seduce</strong> is to accomplish with the <em>mouth</em> what cannot (or should not) be done with a <em>sword</em>.	召す 【めす】 (v5s,vt) (1) to call; to send for; (2) to put on; to wear; to take (a bath); to ride in; to buy; to eat; to drink; to catch (a cold); (P) This kanji isn't anything sexual or anything. It means SUMMON/TO SEND/CALL FOR (as well as honorific form of eat/drink). STORY: A king is having a hard time EATING a piece of of meat b/c it can't fit in his MOUTH, so he CALLS FOR/SUMMONS someone to bring him his SWORD. (this keeps the eat/drink meaning of the kanji true as well).		
昭		shining	Let the key word suggest <b>shining</b> one's shoes, the purpose of which is to <i>seduce</i> the <i>sun</i> down on them for all to see.		9	91	87	5	ショウ		<strong>Shining</strong> is the sun's seduction.	The sun was<strong> shining</strong> so bright that it seduced Icarus and he flew too close.	Edward Cullen SEDUCES Bella when she sees him<strong> SHINING</strong> in the SUN. That sparkly bastard.	The knight in<strong> shining</strong> armour was seduced in just one day.	The Sun Seduces with its<strong> Shining</strong> light.		
則		rule	The character depicts a <i>clam</i> alongside a great and flashing <i>saber</i>. Think of digging for <i>clams</i> in an area where there are gaming <b>rules</b> governing how large a find has to be before you can keep it. So you take your trusty <i>saber</i>, which you have carefully notched like a yardstick, crack open a <i>clam</i> and then measure the poor little beastie to see if it is as long as the <b>rules</b> say it has to be.		9	92	88	5	ソク	のっと.る	When you have both <em>money</em> and the power of the <em>sword</em>, you can make the <strong>rules</strong>.	If you've got CRABs on your SABER, then you didn't follow the<strong> rule</strong>s of safe sex!	The world is<strong> rule</strong>d by <em>money</em> and <em>sword</em>.	A shellfish with a sword <strong>rule</strong>s.	Screw the <strong>rules</strong>, I have <em>money</em> and a <em>saber</em>.		
副		vice-	The key word <b>vice</b> has the sense of someone second-in-command. The great and flashing <i>saber</i> to the right (its usual location, so you need not worry about where to put it from now on) and the <i>wealth</i> on the left combine to create an image of dividing one's property to give a share to one's <b>vice</b>-<i>wealth</i> holder.		11	93	89	5	フク		The <em>wealthy</em> guy with the <em>sword</em> standing next to the king, that's the<strong> vice-</strong>roy who does all the dirty work.	<strong>Vice-</strong>president Cheney: a wealthy saber rattler.	<strong>Vice-</strong>President Cheney shot a man in the face while hunting, as is common knowledge, I imagine. So think of it like a Clue answer and you will remember the symbol order as well. <em>One</em> shot, in the <em>mouth</em>, on a <em>field</em>, with a <em>gun</em> (a modern-day sword).	The Shogun's second in command, handling the wages: One mouth controlling the rice fields to pay for the swords (Japanese samurai got paid in rice).	The VICE president protected my WEALTH with his army of SABER wielding soldiers.		
別		separate	In the Old East, the samurai and his <i>saber</i> were never <b>separated</b>. They were constant companions, like the cowboy of the Old West and his six-shooter. This character depicts what must have been the height of <b>separation</b>-anxiety for a samurai: to be <i>bound up with a rope</i> and unable to get at his <i>saber</i> leaning only a few feet away from him. Look at that <i>mouth</i> bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for <i>tied up</i> is written - just as it had been with the character for <i>ten thousand</i>.		7	94	90	5	ベツ	わか.れる、わ.ける	I don't know about you but to me this seems like someone's head is about to be<strong> separate</strong>d from his body. You can see he's kneeling and his mouth is wide open gasping for the last breath he will ever take.	A wise old samurai keeps his hostages (with their <em>mouths bound up</em> to keep them quiet) in a<strong> separate</strong> room from his <em>sabers</em>. Putting them together would be a silly mistake.	The prisoner with the BOUND MOUTH was<strong> separate</strong>d from his SABRE.	They<strong> separate</strong>d me from the group. They gagged my <em>mouth</em>, <em>bound</em> me up, and threatened me with a <em>saber</em>.	"In Empire Strikes Back, Luke was hanging upside down, muttered with his <em>mouth</em> ""Ben, Ben, Ben"", his feet <em>bound</em> in ice, he was <strong>separated</strong> from his light <em>sabre</em>. And he could hear the monster coming for him."		
丁		street	The picture here is of a <b>street</b> sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any <i>street</i> that immediately conjure sup the image of a <b>street</b> sign to you.	* Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a <i>nail</i> or a <i>spike</i>. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a <i>street</i> sign out of the ground and using it as a <i>nail</i> to repair your garage roof.	2	95	91	5	チョウ、テイ、チン、トウ、チ	ひのと	"Today, the program ""Sesame<strong> Street</strong>"" is brought to you by the letter ""T""."	Two<strong> street</strong>s make a T-intersection.	Any<strong> street</strong> with <em>nails</em> on it had best be avoided.	The<strong> street</strong> sign is nailed with a spike.	"The word on the<strong> street</strong> is, ""Mr. T is a bad-ass!""."		
町		town	<i>Street</i> signs standing at the corner of the <i>rice fields</i> depict the <b>town</b>&nbsp;limits. (Remember what was said earlier: when used as a primitive, a kanji may either take its primitive meaning or revert to the original meaning of its key word.)		7	96	92	5	チョウ	まち	Actually this means <strong>town</strong>, like one that has lots of <em>streets</em> and is surrounded by all the <em>rice fields</em>.	"Getting this one confused with Town is easy, so remember it with this rhyme. ""Pillage the<strong> village</strong>, for the <em>rice</em> and and the <em>tea</em>."" the street primitive on the right looks like a 't'."	"Note: the keywords of <a href=""../v4/92.html"">village</a> (#92 町) and <a href=""../v4/208.html"">town</a> (#208 村) swap places in translated editions of RTK I. In fact, according to different dictionaries, 町 is closer to 'town' whereas 村 is closer to 'village'."	<em>Streets</em> through <em>rice fields</em> are only found in small <strong>villages</strong>.	チョウ　まち A<strong> village</strong>/TOWN is nothing more than rice fields connected by streets.		
可		can	"Remember the story about the ""Little Engine that <b>Could</b>"" when you hear this key word, and the rest is simple. See the determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the mountain - ""I think I <b>can</b>, I think I <b>can</b>...."" - spitting railroad <i>spikes</i> out of its <i>mouth</i> as it chews up the line to the top."		5	97	93	5	カ、コク	-べ.き	"A mouth on the street asking for things: ""Can I get some help?!<strong> Can</strong> I get directions,<strong> Can</strong> I have some money?<strong> Can</strong> you please speak English?!""."	I<strong> can</strong> eat nails.	"On Main STREET America, what you hear in people's MOUTHs is ""Yes We<strong> CAN</strong>!""."	A square box<strong> can</strong> fit in a corner.	<strong>Can</strong> you <em>speak</em> <em>street</em>? (as in street <em>talk</em>).		
頂		place on the head	"The key word is actually a formal metaphor meaning ""humble acceptance."" Reading off the two primitive elements in the order of their writing, we have: <i>nail</i> . . . <i>head</i>. As in ""hitting the <i>nail</i> on the <i>head</i>."" Now one presumes that most people can handle metaphors, but if you were to run into a dimwit working in a hardware store who only knew the literal meaning of things, and were to ask him, in your best Japanese, to <b>place on your head</b> a nail, he might miss the point and cause you considerable torment."		11	98	94	5	チョウ	いただ.く、いただき	If I put a <em>street sign</em> on my <em>head</em> what do I get ? A<strong> place on the head</strong> !	<em>NAILS</em> - <strong>place directly on the <em>fore</em>head</strong>, <em>NAILS</em> - <strong>place directly on the <em>fore</em>head</strong>, <em>NAILS</em> - <strong>place directly on the <em>fore</em>head</strong>, The <strong>HEAD ON</strong> commercial <em>nail</em>s it into your <em>head</em>……	"You've probably noticed that even the rudest and crudest Japanese say ""Itadakimasu"" before every meal. Why? Because each person who failed to say it as a child had a <em>nail</em> driven straight into that tender<strong> PLACE ON THE HEAD</strong> (i.e. the very top of the head). That's a lesson no one will forget!"	Driving down the STREET, looking at a PAGE in the map, I hit another car, and started bleeding from a<strong> place on the head</strong>.	<em>Nail</em> the <em>page</em> to the wall! <em>Place</em> a Bounty <em>On the head</em>.		
子		child	This kanji is a pictograph of a <b>child</b> wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young <b>children</b> who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck.	* As a primitive, the meaning of <i>child</i> is retained, though you might imagine a little older <i>child</i>, able to run around and get into more mischief.	3	99	95	6	シ、ス、ツ	こ、-こ、ね	A<strong> child</strong> who is <em>ten</em> will still ask for his <em>ma</em> (top looks a bit like katakana ma).	A pictograph of a<strong> child</strong>, with arms outstretched for mother (or perhaps because she is chasing a rat?). Note that this kanji occupies the first space on the Zodiac circle, and is the sign for the rat (such as 2008!).	A ten year old<strong> child</strong> with a baseball cap.	A<strong> child</strong>, from one to ten, before becoming a teen.	I'd imagine most people knew this long before starting RTK. When they were still a <strong>child</strong> of kanji, perhaps?		
孔		cavity	"Probably the one thing most <i>children</i> fear more than anything else is the dentist's chair. Once a <i>child</i> has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word <b>cavity</b>, even though it is not likely to know that the word means ""hole"" until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny <i>hooks</i> the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back."		4	100	96	6	コウ	あな	The child's arms flailed around at the sight of the hooked tool the dentist was going to use to fill his<strong> cavity</strong>.	I warned him about <strong>cavities</strong>, but the <em>child</em> is still <em>hooked</em> on sweets.	When a <em>child</em> falls into a <strong>cavity</strong> we need a <em>hook</em> to get them out.	A <em>child hooked</em> on candy canes (sweets) is bound to get a<strong> cavity</strong>.	"コウ　//　HOLE　// ""Confucius pulled the child out of the hole using a big hook."" 鼻孔 （びこう）nostril. 孔子 （こうし）Confucius."		
了		complete	"Learn this character by returning to frame 99 and the image given there. The only difference is that the ""arms"" have been left off (actually, only tucked inside). Thus a <i>child</i> with its arms wrapped up into the back-sack is the picture of a job successfully <b>completed</b>."		2	101	97	6	リョウ		The experiment was a<strong> complete</strong> failure! The child was made without any arms!	A child with the arms inside the blanket will be<strong> complete</strong>ly wrapped up.	The child in not<strong> complete</strong>. He's got no arms!	Don't be tempted to write another stroke and make 子 . This kanji, 了 , is already<strong> complete</strong>.	No parent can say their child rearing is<strong> complete</strong> until the child stops holding out his hand for money.		
女		woman	You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting <b>woman</b> drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy; being able to write it beautifully is another thing.	* The primitive meaning is the same: <i>woman</i>.	3	102	98	6	ジョ、ニョ、ニョウ	おんな、め	"To remember the order of strokes, remember a female ninja is called a ""kunoichi"". That is, く(hiragana) ノ(katakana) 一 (kanji, ichi=one)."	My mother taught me that a<strong> woman</strong> should always sit with her legs crossed (but the arms can be stretched out).	The<strong> woman</strong> has her legs crossed.	When a<strong> woman</strong> becomes a ninja she is called a kunoichi (<strong>くノ一</strong>).	"To remember the stroke order, a female ninja is called a "" くノ一 ""."		
好		fond	"The phrase ""to be <b>fond</b> of someone"" has a natural gentleness about it, and lends a tenderness to the sense of touching by giving us the related term ""to <b>fondle</b>."" The character likens it to a <i>woman</i> <b>fondling</b> her <i>child</i>."		6	103	99	6	コウ	この.む、す.く、よ.い、い.い	A <em>woman</em> is<strong> fond</strong> of her <em>child</em>.	Women are<strong> fond</strong> of children.	If you are<strong> fond</strong> of a <em>woman</em>, she will make you a <em>child</em>.	Your wife and child: the thing you are most<strong> fond</strong> of.	There is no <strong>fond</strong>ness greater than what a <em>woman</em> feels for her <em>child</em>.		
如		likeness	Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the <i>mouth</i> of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a <i>woman</i> gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a <b>likeness</b> to the <i>opening</i> of the <i>woman</i> from whom you were born.		6	104	100	6	ジョ、ニョ	ごと.し	<em>Women</em> share a common<strong> likeness</strong>. Their <em>mouth</em>s are always open, whining about this and that.	"A <em>woman</em>'s <em>mouth</em> has the<strong> likeness</strong> of a vaccum cleaner, it's noisy and all it's good for is sucking. Do not confuse with <a href=""../v4/114.html"">resemblance</a> (#114 肖).<strong> Likeness</strong> is purely conceptual, whereas resemblance refers to actual physical similarities."	From a woman's other 口 comes a baby with a perfect<strong> likeness</strong>.	As a woman with a big mouth, Angelina Jolie was a perfect<strong> likeness</strong> for Lara Croft.	Women share one<strong> likeness</strong>: They have a big mouth! (I don't actually hold this view at all, but it does make it easy to remember).		
母		mama	Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for <i>woman</i> in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a <b>mama</b>. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.	* As a primitive we shall add the meaning of <i>breasts</i> in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame.	5	105	101	6	ボ	はは、も	The two breasts of a momma who breastfeeds.	This<strong> mama</strong> had twins, one <em>mouth</em> for each <em>nipple</em>.	"To remember strokes: it's a <em>breast</em> exam: 1)start like a <em>woman</em> 2) cross your heart (the lower right is crossed) 3) check your ""nipples"" 4) lift and separate (the last stroke parts the two ""breasts"")."	"<em>L7</em>… To remember the strokes: this begins by writing ""L7"", which is 50s slang for ""square"" or uncool. (As a teenager I thought my<strong> mama</strong> was really square) Add the ""nipples"" and then use the last stroke to part the two ""breasts""… 母 [はは] <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E3%81%8A%E6%AF%8D%E3%81%95%E3%82%93"">、お母さん</a> [おかあさん] <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E6%AF%8D%E4%B9%B3"">、母乳</a> [ぼにゅう] <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E4%BC%AF%E6%AF%8D"">、伯母</a> /叔母[おば]."	The<strong> mama</strong> has two babies (drops) in the cradle.		
貫		pierce	If one is asked to think of associations for the word <b>pierce</b>, among the first to come to mind is that of <b>piercing</b> one's ears to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that has survived into the 21st century. The kanji here is read, top to bottom: <i>mama</i> . . . <i>oyster</i>. All you need to do is imagine <b>piercing</b> an ear so that it can hold a mother-of-pearl (actually, a <i>mama</i>-of-pearl) you have just wrested from an <i>oyster</i>.		11	106	102	6	カン	つらぬ.く、ぬ.く、ぬき	Ariel the Little Mermaid's <em>clamshell</em> bra was held to her <em>breasts</em> by <strong>piercings</strong>.	The sad fate of <em>Mama</em> <em>shellfish</em> was to be captured and <strong>pierced</strong> to make an earring.	<em>mama</em> <strong>pierces</strong> her ears in order to wear pearl earrings (which come from <em>shellfish</em>).	Boobs<strong> PIERCE</strong>D by shellfish! AAAH!!!	"""Mama"" sat on a ""shellfish"" and it<strong> pierce</strong>d her bottom! Ow!"		
兄		elder brother	"By now kanji like this one should ""look like"" something to you even though it is more of an ""ideogram"" than a ""pictograph."" The large <i>mouth</i> on top and the <i>human legs</i> below almost jump off the page as a caricature of <b>elder brother</b>, the one with the big <i>mouth</i> (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who ""has the say"" among all the children)."	* As a primitive this character will take the meaning of <i>teenager</i>, in accord with the familiar image of the big <i>mouth</i> and the gangling, clumsy <i>legs</i>.	5	107	103	6	ケイ、キョウ	あに	My<strong> elder brother</strong> was basically a mouth on legs when he was a teenager.	The pac man's ( 只 )<strong> elder brother</strong> has to have longer legs than his junior.	Older teenage brothers have big mouths and long, awkward legs.	My<strong> elder brother</strong> has a big MOUTH and LONG LEGS.	My <strong>elder brother</strong> always let his <em>mouth</em> <em>run</em>.		
呪		curse	For some reason, the inventor of this kanji associated a <b>curse</b> with the <i>mouth</i> of an <i>older brother</i>. I leave it to you to decide if he is on the giving or receiving end of the sorcery.		8	108	2169	6	ジュ、シュ、シュウ、ズ	まじな.う、のろ.い、まじな.い、のろ.う	Caution: this means a spell, not to swear. I put a<strong> curse</strong> on my <em>elder brother</em> so that he can never open his <em>mouth</em>.	Your <em>older brother</em>'s <em>mouth</em> often <strong>curses</strong>.	There's an ancient<strong> curse</strong> in this region whereby the firstborn son, i.e. the <em>elder brother</em>, is always born with an extra <em>mouth</em>. And regardless of the elder brother's own personality, the extra mouth is bad tempered and always <strong>cursing</strong>.	A <em>mouthy teenager</em> is<strong> curse</strong>d to get into trouble time and time again.	"It's interesting how Halparn, Henshall and ""Kanji Learners Dictionary"" all forfeit to include this kanji, yet kana-heavy games like Final Fantasy assumes their gamer has knowledge of this kanji. Just sayin'. Story: I put a <strong>curse</strong> on the <em>mouth</em> of my <em>older brother</em> to shut him up. He's an annoying bugger, after all."		
克		overcome	"In this frame we get a chance to use the kanji we just learned in its primitive meaning of <i>teenager</i>. The <i>needle</i> on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the <i>teenager</i> growing up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the <i>needle</i> at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that ""We Shall <b>Overcome</b>"" the plague, will the <i>needle</i> cease to hangover their heads, as it does in this character."		7	109	104	6	コク	か.つ	Ten elder brothers can<strong> overcome</strong> anything.	A <strong>teenager</strong> addicted to heroine must <strong>overcome</strong> the <em>needle</em>.	<strong>Overcome</strong> your <em>elder brother</em> with a <em>needle</em> to his head.	Having <strong>ten</strong> older brothers would be hard to<strong> overcome</strong>. <strong>Ten</strong> mouths, and <strong>ten</strong> sets of legs kicking the crap out of you.	<em>Ten teenagers</em> were chosen to<strong> OVERCOME</strong> all odds and save the world. The start of almost every JRPG.		
小		little	"The sense of <b>little</b> that this character represents is not the same as ""a little bit."" That meaning comes in the next frame. Here <b>little</b> means ""small"" or ""tiny."" The image is one of three <b>little</b> <i>drops</i>, the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: <b>little</b>, <b>little</b>, nothing but <b>little</b>."	* The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards.	3	110	105	7	ショウ	ちい.さい、こ-、お-、さ-	A<strong> little</strong> penguin with its wings at its side.	A depressed child, head low and arms hung low, because he's too<strong> little</strong> to ride the roller coaster.	Hold something<strong> little</strong> in-between your fingertips and it'll look like this Kanji here. :).	<strong>Little</strong><strong> little</strong><strong> little</strong> drops…	Ohh, how cute - a<strong> little</strong> penguin!		
少		few	First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the <i>drop</i> at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated drop will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny <i>drop</i> indicate a further belittling of what is already <i>little</i> - thus making it a <b>few</b> of something <i>little</i>.		4	111	106	7	ショウ	すく.ない、すこ.し	Only a<strong> few</strong> people can make an ugly face like that.	<strong>Few</strong> usually refers to three. To emphasize three, we underline the three drops in little.	A happy grin, after a<strong> few</strong> drinks.	That playground has a<strong> few</strong> little ones sliding down the slide.	A<strong> few</strong> <em>little penguins</em> slide belly-first down an ice <em>slide</em>.		
大		large	Here we have a simple pictograph of a person, taking up the space of an entire character and giving it the sense of <b>large</b>. It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms.	* As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a <i>large dog</i> or, if you prefer, a <i>St. Bernard dog</i>. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made.	3	112	107	7	ダイ、タイ	おお-、おお.きい、-おお.いに	A person stretching their arms and legs to look<strong> large</strong> and scare a bear away.	How<strong> large</strong>? This<strong> large</strong>!	Think of a<strong> large</strong> St. Bernard dog with his paws all stretched out.	A person ( 人 -fr.951) showing itself<strong> large</strong>r widening its arms.	That volcano is so big, or<strong> large</strong>, it goes over the clouds (the clouds being the horizontal line).		
多		many	"""<b>Many</b> <i>moons</i> ago,"" begins much of Amerindian folklore - a colorful way of saying ""Once upon a time"" and a great deal of help for remembering this kanji. Here we have two <i>moons</i> (three of them would take us back to the beginning of time, which is further than we want to go), lacking the final stroke because they are partially hidden behind the clouds of time."		6	113	108	7	タ	おお.い、まさ.に、まさ.る	<em>Two evenings</em> too<strong> many</strong>!	"This reminds me of a childish pseudo-confucion rhyme: ""He who eats<strong> many</strong> prunes sits on toilet<strong> many</strong> <em>moons</em>""."	"These look like the katakana ""ta"" therefore; There are<strong> MANY</strong> tatas! WOO~~~!"	The ninja waited<strong> many</strong> evenings for the right moment to strike.	<strong>Many</strong> <em>moons</em> ago.. or perhaps it was just a couple of <em>evenings</em>, I can't remember.		
夕		evening	"Just as the word <b>evening</b> adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word ""night,"" so the kanji for <b>evening</b> takes the ordinary looking <i>moon</i> in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame)."	* The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji.	3	114	109	7	セキ	ゆう	The<strong> evening</strong> is young, the <em>moon</em> is not full.	In the<strong> evening</strong>, the crescent <em>moon</em> hangs in the sky.	"In the<strong> evening</strong>, I try my best to remember the katakana symbol for ""TA"" (ie. ""ta ta!"")."	When I come back home from work in the<strong> evening</strong> I say <em>ta</em>daima.	This<strong> EVENING</strong>, there is only a half-<em>moon</em>.		
汐		eventide	In the next lesson we will meet the character for morning-<i>tide</i> and the element for <i>drops of water</i>. Meantime we have a perfect blend of picture and idea in this kanji to play on the English word for nightfall, <b>eventide</b>: <i>drops of water</i> inching their way up the shore in the <i>evening</i>.		6	115	110	7	セキ	しお、うしお、せい	<strong>Eventide</strong> is just another word for evening, and it has the word tide in it which we associate with water.	<em>Drops</em> of water shower the beach as the <em>evening</em> tide approaches:<strong> eventide</strong>.	<strong>Eventide</strong> is when the drops of water are attracted to the moon. This is the tide which occurs in the evening.	In the<strong> eventide</strong> (nightfall), drops of water start forming in the evening.	The viking hordes arrive on the<strong> eventide</strong>, water spashes as the evening sky turn red with blood.		
外		outside	On the left, the primitive for <i>evening</i>, and on the right, that for the <i>magic wand</i>. Now, as every magician worth his abracadabra knows, bringing your <i>magic wand</i> out into the <i>evening</i> air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to stay indoors. Hence, <i>evening</i> and <i>magic wand</i> takes you naturally <b>outside</b>.		5	116	111	7	ガイ、ゲ	そと、ほか、はず.す、はず.れる、と-	"A young magician likes to practice<strong> outside</strong> in the <em>evening</em> with his <em>magic wand</em> (as opposed to the old magician who wakes <em>early</em> to practice with his <em>wand</em> in <a href=""../v4/51.html"">eminent</a> (#51 卓))."	<strong>Outside</strong> in the dark of evening, only a magic wand can help you.	Your <em>evening</em> is successful if you get to pull your <em>wand</em><strong> outside</strong> your pants.	Fairies live<strong> outside</strong>, and only come out in the <em>evening</em>. When they do, they wave their <em>magic wands</em> as they dance.

名		name	Perhaps you have heard of the custom, still preserved in certain African tribes, of a father creeping into the tent or hut of his newborn child on the night of the child's birth, to whisper into its ear the <b>name</b> he has chosen for it, before making his choice public. It is an impressive <b>naming</b> custom and fits in tidily with the way this character is constructed: <i>evening</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>. At <i>evening</i> time, a <i>mouth</i> pronounces the <b>name</b> that will accompany one throughout life.		6	117	112	7	メイ、ミョウ	な、-な	In the evening, when it becomes dark, open your mouth to say your<strong> name</strong> so that people can recognise you.	In the evening, her sweet mouth whispered my<strong> name</strong>.	Because it's dark in the <em>evening</em>, you need to open your <em>mouth</em> and speak your<strong> name</strong> to identify yourself. (This is a traditional mnemonic for this kanji).	In African tradition, the father sneaks up to the baby in the EVENING, and whispers using his MOUTH the<strong> NAME</strong> which the baby will carry for his entire life.	My real<strong> name</strong> is eveningmouth, but you can call me Bob :).		
石		stone	With a <i>mouth</i> under a <i>cliff</i>, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great <b>stone</b> has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> should be enough to push the <b>stone</b> aside. But take care - the <i>cliff</i> is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in <i>cliff</i> will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of.	* The <i>stone</i> is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of <i>stones</i> or <i>rocks</i> of any size or shape.	5	118	113	7	セキ、シャク、コク	いし	Indiana Jones jumps up and grabs the lip of <em>cliff</em> just in time to evade the huge<strong> STONE</strong> rolling out of the <em>mouth</em> of the cave!	There's a VERY simple way to remember this, in case the <em>cliff</em> thing isn't working for you… Just see it as a<strong> stone</strong> [いし] being <em>hammered</em> by a miner searching for jewel<strong> stone</strong>s [ほう<strong>せき</strong>] ;).	If you pick the <em>right</em><strong> stone</strong>, and hit the kanji 右 <em>right</em> on its head really hard, you can chip off the upper stroke from it.	"A <a href=""../v4/11.html"">mouth</a> (#11 口) open beneath a cliff is bound to swallow some<strong> stone</strong>."	A<strong> stone</strong> covers the entrance to a cave hidden under a cliff.		
肖		resemblance	"The word <b>resemblance</b> should suggest, among other things, a son's <b>resemblance</b> to his father. A ""chip off the old block"" is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a <i>little</i> bit of <i>flesh</i>."	* When used as a primitive, the sense of <i>resemblance</i> is replaced by that of <i>spark</i> or <i>candle</i>. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for <i>moon</i> also carries a secondary sense of <i>fire</i>, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)	7	119	114	7	ショウ	あやか.る	Using DNA matching, a very little bit of flesh can be used to show the <strong>resemblence</strong> between family members.	Hey baby, it might be a <em>little</em> bit of <em>flesh</em> now, but in a moment it'll bear a strong <strong>resemblance</strong> to a <em>candlestick</em>.(nudge nudge, wink wink).	This kanji bears a<strong> resemblance</strong> to sparks on a candle. (I always remember the primitive, but never the original keyword.).	<em><strong>あやか-る</strong></em>: to share, goodluck—Resemblance = To have LITTLE difference in the FLESH.	God breathing a <em>sparkle</em> of life into <em>flesh</em> to make human <strong>resemblant</strong> to him.		
硝		nitrate	The word <b>nitrate</b> should immediately suggest a beaker of <b>nitric</b> acid, which, as every high-school chemistry student knows, can eat its way through some pretty tough substances. Here we imagine pouring it over a <i>rock</i> and watching the <i>sparks</i> fly as it bores a hole through the rock.		12	120	115	7	ショウ		That stone has sparks coming out of it! Someone must have poured<strong> nitrate</strong> acid on it.	"Salpetre is the common name for<strong> Nitrate</strong> coming from Latin ""sal petrae"" or <em>stone</em> salt. It is also a component of gun powder so including a <em>candle</em> in this kanji can be quite explosive!"	People I study Kanji with kept talking about some<strong> nitrate</strong>. I didn't even know what<strong> nitrate</strong> is, so I hit them with a stone so hard there were sparks flying everywhere. Months later my cell-mate in jail told me it's some sort of acid, but I didn't care any more… Thanks to this Kanji I got 30 years, thank you.	That stone resembles<strong> nitrate</strong>.	A stone containing<strong> nitrate</strong> and a candle are not good together.		
砕		smash	We begin with the two elements on the right, <i>baseball</i> and <i>needle</i>. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a <i>game of cricket</i> in which a <i>needle</i> is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a <i>rock</i> for a ball. A <b>smash</b> hit would probably splinter the bat in all directions, and a <b>smashing</b> pitch would do the same with the <i>needle</i> wicket.		9	121	116	7	サイ	くだ.く、くだ.ける	To<strong> SMASH</strong> a STONE you need to hit it NINE or TEN times.	The Stones (the Rolling Stones) are 90 aged but they've done a new<strong> SMASH</strong> hit!	"Hulk<strong> smash</strong>! Hulk<strong> smash</strong> <em>stone</em>! Hulk decimate <em>stone</em>! What does ""decimate"" mean, Hulk? Uh, means destroy <em>nine</em> <em>tenths</em> of.<strong> SMASH</strong>!"	A <em>stone</em> will<strong> smash</strong> a car-window <em>nine</em> times out of <em>ten</em>.	Hulk<strong> SMASH</strong>! Hulk throw ROCK! Hulk hit 9 people! No! Hulk hit 10 people! Bad people! Hulk<strong> smash</strong>!		
砂		sand	Good <b>sand</b> for beaches has <i>few</i> or no <i>stones</i> in it. That means that all of us whose feet have been spoiled by too much time in shoes don't have to watch our step as we cavort about.		9	122	117	7	サ、シャ	すな	Here's how I remember that <em>stone</em> is on the left. This is because<strong> sand</strong> starts as <em>stones</em>, and only later they become <em>few</em>.	In good<strong> SAND</strong>, <em>stones</em> are <em>few</em>, if any.	Over time, <em>rocks</em> are worn down into just a <em>few</em> grains of<strong> sand</strong>.	To make<strong> sand</strong>, start by grinding a few stones.	<strong>Sand</strong> has <em>stones</em> <em>few</em> and far between. 砂 【すな】 (n)<strong> sand</strong>; grit; 砂糖 【さとう】 (n) sugar;.		
妬		jealous	It should not be hard to leep from the key word to the image of a <i>woman</i> who is <b>jealous</b> of the <i>rock</i> that another <i>woman</i> is sporting on the third finger of her left hand.		8	123	2195	7	ト、ツ	ねた.む、そね.む、つも.る、ふさ.ぐ	The<strong> jealous</strong> <em>woman</em> bashed the brains in of the guy who betrayed her, with a <em>stone</em>.	WOMEN are<strong> JEALOUS</strong> of the STONE on my wife's ring.	I'm<strong> jealous</strong> that my <em>woman</em> has a crush on <em>The Rock</em>.	A<strong> jealous</strong> <em>woman</em> is as cold and hard as a <em>rock</em>.	The <em>woman</em> is<strong> jealous</strong> of her man, the <em>rock</em> star.		
削		plane	Long before the invention of the carpenter's <b>plane</b>, people used knives and machetes (or here, <i>sabers</i>) to smooth out their woodwork. If you have ever seen the process, you will have been amazed at the speed and agility with which the adept can <b>plane</b> a hunk of wood into shape. Indeed, you can almost see the <i>sparks</i> fly from their <i>sabers</i>.		9	124	118	7	サク	けず.る、はつ.る、そ.ぐ	<em>Sparks</em> will fly if you attempt to<strong> PLANE</strong> your <em>sabre</em>.	With today's strict air regulations, carrying a <em>sabre</em> onto a<strong> plane</strong> could <em>spark</em> quite a commotion.	"Not ""<em>a <strong>plane</strong>""</em>, but <em>""to <strong>plane</strong>""</em>. To carve a sculpture from wooden block, you cut it (with a <em>sword</em>) little by little, until there is <em>resemblance</em> with whatever it was meant to <em>resemble</em>."	The carpenter's<strong> plane</strong> <em>resembles</em> a <em>saber</em>.	<em>sparks</em> fly from the <em>blade</em> as they <strong>plane</strong> the surface to perfection.		
光		ray	"There are really only 2 primitives here, <i>little</i> and <i>human legs</i>. The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner's eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of ""dust"" are that dance around in the light-<b>rays</b> that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as <i>little</i> and disembodied <i>human legs</i>, and you should have no trouble with this character."		6	125	119	7	コウ	ひか.る、ひかり	A<strong> ray</strong> of light is not a wave but made of <em>little</em> photons with <em>human legs</em>.	The<strong> ray</strong> from Honey I Shrunk the Kids made people <em>little</em> - ha! look at them run around on their tiny <em>legs</em>!	Imagine a<strong> ray</strong> gun shooting someone and their body exploding (sparks) and just their legs left.	<strong>Little legs</strong> at play are a<strong> ray</strong> of light in my day.	<strong>Ray</strong> is <em>tiny</em> <em>legs</em> of light…		
太		plump	"""<b>Plump</b>"" is one of those delightful English words that almost sound like their meaning. No sooner do you hear it than you think of a round and ample-bodied person falling into a sofa like a <i>large drop</i> of oil plopping into a fishbowl - kerrrr-<b>plump</b>!"		4	126	120	7	タイ、タ	ふと.い、ふと.る	A <em>large</em> person with a big <em>drop</em> of sweat dripping off of him because he is so<strong> plump</strong>.	"Fat(""plump"") men always have small penises…..the kanji is a combination of ""large"" with a drop(representing the small penis between his legs)."	A big,<strong> plump</strong> sumo wrestler with a loincloth covering his little drop. (Thanks Fabrice).	"To keep this distinct from the primitive meaning of ""round"" (""fat man"") I suggest to use a specific image, such as that of a<strong> plump</strong> Japanese sumo wrestler, and let the <em>drop</em> between the legs be the loincloth (which compared to their <em>large</em> body size, is quite a <em>drop</em>). To illustrate the importance of this, have a look at the kanji for ""tenacious"" (frame 1506) and ""burdensome"" (frame 1986)."	The<strong> plump</strong> <em>dog</em> <em>drop</em>ped its tail between its legs.		
器		utensil	The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy <i>St. Bernard dog</i> stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty <i>mouth</i>, waiting for the <b>utensils</b> to arrive so the feast can begin.		15	127	121	7	キ	うつわ	Imagine four hungry <em>mouths</em> all sitting around the table. They are all banging their <strong>utensils</strong> on the table waiting for a <em>big</em> meal to be placed in the centre.	"Note: 器 by itself means <strong>container/caliber/vessel</strong>. And 食器 means eating<strong> utensil</strong>s (""food container"", hehe)."	Four <em>mouths</em> sit at the four corners of the table, waiting for their<strong> utensil</strong>s, ready to devour the large, spread eagled St. Bernard stretched out on the table!	I swear RevTK has got too politically correct, I mean people on here are copying Heisig's original story only shortening it which is fine, yet they are getting dislikes, only due to the fact its about eating a dog!? Other instances include where people make slight reference to sex, race, violence - Heisig clearly states that it's fine to do this. (part 1, part two on the next frame).	Four jgirl's mouths surrounding my large<strong> utensil</strong>.		
臭		stinking	This character is a bit friendlier to the animal world. Our friend the <i>St. Bernard</i> is alive and well, its <i>nose</i> in the air sniffing suspiciously after something <b>stinking</b> somewhere or other.		9	128	122	7	シュウ	くさ.い、-くさ.い、にお.う、にお.い	The ST. BERNARD DOG lifted his large NOSE high in the air to find out where the<strong> stinking</strong> smell comes from.	When <em>I</em> is <em>big</em>, Ego<strong> stinking</strong>.	<em>I</em> have just done a <em>big</em> one. It's really<strong> stinking</strong>.	If you put your NOSE directly on top of a ST. BERNARD, you'd surely be able to smell it's<strong> stinking</strong> wet fur.	Should one let <em>oneself</em> get too <em>large</em>, bodily functions may start<strong> stinking</strong>!		
嗅		sniff	You have seen those scratch'n'<b>sniff</b> advertisements for perfumes. This one is for a <i>mouth</i>wash that replaces one <i>stinking</i> oder with another.		12	129	3008	7	キュウ	か.ぐ	"<strong>Smell</strong>. <em>Mouth</em> agape, <em>nose</em> in the air, a <em>chihuahua</em> <strong>smells</strong> some BBQ miles away. NOTE: Assigned keyword ""sniff"" in RTK Newly Approved General Use Kanji Supplement."	<strong>smell</strong>: You open your mouth and gasp for air, that stinking (notice the chihuahua instead) smell is too much.	You open your <em>mouth</em> and gasp for air, 1<strong> sniff</strong> of that <em>stinking</em> chihuahua is too much. *Edited thecite's to reflect the keyword in the supplement.	Only 12 strokes. Dot over dog is not there anymore.	Your mouth stinks: you need to<strong> sniff</strong> your breath.		
妙		exquisite	"The primitive for <i>woman</i> is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for <i>few</i>. When we refer to a <i>woman</i> as <b>exquisite</b>, we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but <i>few</i> and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word <b>exquisite</b> carries this same sense of ""seeking out"" the rare from the ordinary."		7	130	123	7	ミョウ、ビョウ	たえ	<strong>Exquisite</strong> <em>women</em> are <em>few</em> and far between.	A geisha is an<strong> exquisite</strong> and <strong>delicate</strong> (another meaning of this kanji) women, however, even in the past there was only few of them.	<strong>Exquisite</strong> women are few.	All WOMEN are beautiful, only a FEW are<strong> EXQUISITE</strong>…	<em>Women</em> have<strong> exquisite</strong> taste - they only like <em>few</em> things.		
省		focus	When we think of <b>focusing</b> on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our <i>eye</i> on a <i>few</i> important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a <i>few</i> things and holding them before one's <i>eye</i> in order to <b>focus</b> on them better.		9	131	124	7	セイ、ショウ	かえり.みる、はぶ.く	You<strong> focus</strong> by concentrating your <em>eye</em> on <em>few</em>er objects.	To remember the order: When <strong>focusing</strong>, keep a <em>few</em> things your TOP priority, so only they come UNDER your <em>sight</em>.	Success (or survival?) method for accelerated juggling course: <em>focus</em> on a <em>few</em> nitroglycerine filled juggling balls flying OVER your <em>eyes</em> —(I have trouble with this <em>few</em> primitive that can be anywhere in a kanji. To build in its location in the story is important somehow).	<em>Few</em> distractions will catch your <em>eye</em> if you have<strong> FOCUS</strong>.	<em>few</em> people can<strong> focus</strong> their <em>eyes</em> perfectly, that is 20/20, the rest of us have to wear glasses because we see out of<strong> focus</strong>.		
厚		thick	When we refer to someone as <b>thick</b>-skinned or <b>thick-</b>headed, we are usually quick to add - even if only under our breath - something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for <b>thick</b> depicts a <i>child</i> abandoned out on the wild <i>cliffs</i>, exposed to the heat of the <i>sun</i>, and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as <b>thick</b> as the parent who left it there.		9	132	125	7	コウ	あつ.い、あか	The <strong>thick</strong> <em>cliff</em> walls protected the <em>children</em> from the <em>sun</em>.	In Sparta we throw our Children over a Cliff. Under the Sun, they fight other Children. In the end, if they survive, they sure have<strong> thick</strong> skin.	<strong>Thick</strong> skinned <em>child</em>, got that way by burning under the <em>sun</em> while playing at the bottom of a <em>cliff</em> which reflects and intensifies the light. (He's safe though, because there's no overhang).	The japanese word for<strong> thick</strong> is atsui which is a homophone for hot, a kid under a cliff with the sun baking down on him would be hot indeed, especially if he had a<strong> thick</strong> sweater on. An atsui seetaa under the atsui sun.	A <em>child</em> who grew up under the burning <em>sun</em> on dry, bare <em>cliffs</em> is bound to be<strong> thick</strong>-skinned.		
奇		strange	"The elements we are given to work with here are <i>St. Bernard dog</i> and <i>can</i>. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word <i>can</i>. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along) to stick closely to the elements, in this case, <i>mouth</i> and <i>nails</i>. Now all we need do is create a fictitious ""<b>Strange</b> But True"" column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a <i>St. Bernard</i> whose <i>mouth</i> has been <i>nailed</i> shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard."		8	133	126	7	キ	く.しき、あや.しい、くし、めずら.しい	I find it<strong> strange</strong> that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train. To me when I look at this kanji, I see a train just about to come out of a tunnel, and above the man waiting for his oppourtunity where he can end it all.	Imagine a ST. BERNARD DOG carrying a CAN instead of a barrel in rescue missions. How<strong> strange</strong>!	"A <em>dog</em> that <em>can</em> do the ""Can Can"" would be a<strong> STRANGE</strong> sight indeed."	It's 'strange' to see a St. Bernard driving 'The Little Engine That Could'.	A <em>St. Bernard</em> that <em>can</em> eat <em>nails</em>?! How<strong> strange</strong>!		
川		stream	We have taken the image of a river <b>stream</b> over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a <b>stream</b>.	* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of <i>stream</i> the more vivid image of a <i>flood</i>. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements: on the left, it is written the same. on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook	3	134	127	8	セン	かわ	"So as not to confuse this with <a href=""../v4/146.html"">river</a> (#146 河) think of<strong> stream</strong>ers falling down."	There are <em>three</em> default I/O <strong>Streams</strong> in UNIX, stdin, stdout, and stderr.	<em>Three</em><strong> stream</strong>s grouped together might cause a flood!	<strong>Stream</strong>ers,<strong> stream</strong>ing down.	In Ghostbusters, Egon warned that crossing the <strong>streams</strong> would result in total proton reversal, that's why the lines should not intersect.		
州		state	Here we see <i>drops of</i> land (little islets) rising up out of a <i>stream</i>, creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the <b>state</b>-line is drawn between <b>states</b> separated by a river? If there were little <i>drops of</i> land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it.		6	135	128	8	シュウ、ス	す	There were 3 little islands in the <em>stream</em> who all decided to set themselves up as independent <strong>states</strong>.	"シュウ　The original meaning of this character was ""sandbar"", and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American<strong> state</strong>s. Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by<strong> state</strong> after<strong> state</strong> as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars."	All powerful<strong> STATE</strong>S grew from a few small settlements along RIVER.	Three votes in a<strong> state</strong> election are as meaningless as as many drops in a stream.	The<strong> state</strong> of a <em>stream</em> is not changed by adding three <em>drops</em>.		
順		obey	"In primitive language, this character would read <i>stream</i> . . . <i>head</i>. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of <b>obey</b>. Either one <b>obeys</b> the person who is <i>head</i> of an organization or else <b>obeys</b> by following the <i>stream</i> of opinion (""current"" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji."		12	136	129	8	ジュン		"""Obey,<strong> Obey</strong>!"" says the brain-washing scientist as he sends a <em>stream</em> of orders to fill your <em>head</em>."	<strong>Obey</strong> the orders streaming down from head office.	An ancient form of militaristic torture: I'll hold your <em>head</em> in the <em>river</em> until you<strong> obey</strong>. Or, if you'd prefer, to get the order of primitives correct: In the <em>stream</em> I'll dunk your <em>head</em> until you<strong> obey</strong>.	In Japan,<strong> obey</strong>ing means following the <em>stream</em> of collective opinion BEFORE using your own <em>head</em>.	"順 【じゅん】 (adj-na,n,n-suf) order; turn; (P) ""Your book must have its PAGES in ORDER so that the story flows as clear as a STREAM""."		
水		water	This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of <b>water</b> - not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for <b>water</b>. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a <i>walking stick</i> being dropped vertically into the <b>water</b>, sending <i>droplets</i> out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order.	* As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive. This latter, as we will see, is far more common.	4	137	130	8	スイ	みず、みず-	The kanji for<strong> water</strong> is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig's story doesn't do this).	"For those having issues with this* ""A 7K foot pool of<strong> water</strong>"" Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times."	When you squeeze a stream you get<strong> water</strong>.	Dropping a hooked walking stick into the<strong> water</strong> causes a splash. (The primitive is often contracted to just two drops and a walking stick).	Dropping the <em>walking stick</em> into the<strong> water</strong> sent out <em>droplets</em> in 4 directions.		
氷		icicle	The appearance of the primitive for <i>water</i> in its full form tells us that we have something to do with <i>water</i> here. The extra <i>drop</i> to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a <i>walking stick</i> dropped into <i>water</i> to form an <b>icicle</b>. If it helps, when you hold an <b>icicle</b> up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji.		5	138	131	8	ヒョウ	こおり、ひ、こお.る	<strong>Icicle</strong>s start with 1 frozen <em>drop</em> of <em>water</em>.	<em>A drop</em> in temperature turns <em>water</em> into an<strong> icicle</strong>.	Ooooh (う） Look at the drops of water from that<strong> icicle</strong>. (Hiragana う looks like the left side).	"Just as you dot the ""i"" in<strong> icicle</strong>, so should you dot the water!"	"<strong>Icicle</strong>s form when water drops drop down on each other and freeze. look <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icicle"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icicle</a>."		
永		eternity	"This kanji also uses the full form of <i>water</i>, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with <i>water</i>. Remember what William Blake said about seeing ""infinity in a grain of sand and <b>eternity</b> in an hour""? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see ""<b>eternity</b> in a <i>drop of water</i>."""		5	139	132	8	エイ	なが.い	It would take an<strong> eternity</strong> to count all the drops of water.	It takes but one <em>drop</em> from the most special <em>water</em>: the fountain of youth (and it is written in a special way to with an extra horizontal line on the top) to live for an<strong> eternity</strong>. (In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).	What is your life? A DROP of water on a mini FLOOR when compared to<strong> ETERNITY</strong>!	It will take<strong> ETERNITY</strong> for that drop of water above to drip. Especially since theres a ledge below it…	The <em>drop</em> hung on the ledge above the <em>water</em> for an<strong> eternity</strong>.		
泉		spring	"Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling <b>spring</b> of <i>water</i>, and you will probably notice how the top of the <b>spring</b> you are thinking of, the part where the ""bubbling"" goes on, is all <i>white</i>. Happily, the <i>white</i> is just where it should be, at the top, and the <i>water</i> is at the bottom."	* We will keep this image of a <i>spring</i> when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for <i>water</i>) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for <i>little</i>.	9	140	133	8	セン	いずみ	<em>White</em> is a symbol of purety, so <em>white</em> <em>water</em> is pure water, the precise definition of<strong> spring</strong> water.	Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot<strong> spring</strong>. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot<strong> spring</strong>: a little <em>white</em> towel on top, <em>water</em> below. (This helps keep all associations:<strong> spring</strong>, little and onsen).	A fresh<strong> SPRING</strong> has plenty of frothy <em>white</em> bubbles in its crisp, cool <em>water</em>.	A<strong> spring</strong> has <em>white</em> frothy <em>water</em>.	When<strong> SPRING</strong> comes, <em>white</em> snow melts and becomes <em>water</em>.		
腺		gland	Dig into your <i>flesh</i> and pull out a lymph <b>gland</b>. Now give it a squeeze and watch the <i>spring</i> of lymph spout out of it.		13	141	2466	8	セン		A <em>body part</em> that acts like a <em>spring</em> for hormones is a<strong> gland</strong>.	Sweat and saliva<strong> gland</strong>s act like a spring for fluids. (combining everyone's stories in one mnemonic, thanks mantixen).	Part of your body that springs out sweat, your sweat<strong> gland</strong>s.	If you were to dig into your FLESH and pull out a lymph<strong> GLAND</strong>, a lot of WHITE WATER will SPRING forth from it.	Part of the body that acts as a spring of body fluids.		
原		meadow	"Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the <b>meadow</b> you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain <b>meadow</b> in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of ""The Sound of Music"" will help.) Simply think of little <i>springs</i> bubbling up across the <b>meadow</b> to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous <i>cliff</i>. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the <i>springs</i>, and then falling headlong over the <i>cliff</i>, you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory."		10	142	134	8	ゲン	はら	Follow the <em>springs</em> down the <em>cliff</em> and you will find a nice<strong> meadow</strong>.	Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji<strong> meadow</strong>, used in composite words the most common meaning is <strong>ORIGIN</strong>… To remember just think that life may have begun in <em>pound</em>s or <em>spring</em>s in a land with many <em>cliff</em>s … Just to answer correctly the review lessons think of<strong> meadow</strong> as the <em>origin</em> of a huge forest.	"Forget about ""spring"" because the water primitive is abbreviated to ""little"". This is easy to forget by the time you've finished RTK1. Instead, imagine standing on an exceedingly high <em>cliff</em>. Not overlooking the sea, but overlooking<strong> meadow</strong>s. And what on earth are those <em>white little</em> things? Wow, they're sheep! This cliff must be really high!"	When in a<strong> meadow</strong>, the japanese girls who are <em>white</em> and <em>small</em> search for the shadow of a <em>cliff</em> to avoid taning.	[L2]. Under a CLIFF is a<strong> meadow</strong> with WHITE SMALL flowers.		
願		petition	A <i>meadow</i> and a <i>head</i> are all we are given to work with in the kanji for <b>petition</b>. Since the key word already suggests something like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz <i>head</i> located in the middle of the flowery <i>meadow</i> we used in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling hopefully before it, <b>petitioning</b> for whatever it is they want. (The scarecrow wanted brains, the lion, courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?)		19	143	135	8	ガン	ねが.う、-ねがい	Let's<strong> petition</strong> to save that beautiful MEADOW from overdevelopment by signing on this PAGE.	"Japanese hippies<strong> PETITION</strong> to save a <em>meadow</em> by getting people on the street to sign their <em>page</em> - as you pass by they call out: "" <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%81%8A%E9%A1%98%E3%81%84%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%81%E3%81%8A%E3%81%AD%E3%81%8C%E3%81%84%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D"">お願いします、おねがいします。”</a> ."	Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion cross the <em><strong>meadow</strong></em> to get to the large <em><strong>head</strong></em> that is Oz and make their<strong> PETITION</strong>s for brains, heart, courage and a way home.	In the meadow a giant head has appeared. Everyone signs a<strong> petition</strong> so that it won't eat everyone.	To save the <em>meadow</em> from development, a <em>page</em> of signatures was submitted as a<strong> petition</strong>.		
泳		swim	The primitive to the left, you will recall from Frame 137, represents <i>water</i>. To the right, we see the kanji for <i>eternity</i>. Knowing how much children like <b>swimming</b>, what could be a better image of <i>eternal</i> bliss than an endless expanse of <i>water</i> to <b>swim</b> in without a care in the world?		8	144	136	8	エイ	およ.ぐ	If you don't know how to<strong> swim</strong>, you'll be in that <em>water</em> for <em>eternity</em>.	With that much WATER (2 actually) you would need to<strong> swim</strong> for an ETERNITY.	It'll seem like an eternity in the water if you cannot<strong> swim</strong>.	There's enough <em>water</em> in the world to<strong> swim</strong> for <em>eternity</em>.	"Michael Phelps can<strong> SWIM</strong> for ""eternity"" if you give him enough ""water""."		
沼		marsh	Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the <b>marsh</b>lands are low and near a source of <i>water</i> that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes <b>marshy</b> is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to <i>seduce</i> the <i>water</i> over to its side. But, like most inordinate <i>seductions</i>, the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy <b>marsh</b>.		8	145	137	8	ショウ	ぬま	The<strong> marsh</strong>lands near Mordor seduce Frodo into gazing upon them, and he falls into the water–splash!	A<strong> marsh</strong> is where <em>water</em> is <em>seduced</em> into the ground.	The<strong> marsh</strong> looks just like dry land. Really it's <em>water</em> and it <em>seduces</em> people to step onto it and they sink to their death.	A<strong> marsh</strong>maid (similar to a mermaid) seduces men into her watery area.	<strong>Marsh</strong>. To where all the <em>water</em> was <em>seduced</em> to.		
沖		open sea	"This kanji could hardly be simpler. The key word <b>open sea</b> readily suggests being out <i>in the middle of</i> a great body of <i>water</i> .Thinking of it in this way should avoid confusion with the kanji for ""open,"" which we will meet later on."		7	146	138	8	チュウ	おき、おきつ、ちゅう.する、わく	<strong>Open sea</strong> is a lot of water in the middle of nowhere.	<em>Water</em> in the <em>middle</em> of the ocean is referred to as<strong> open sea</strong>.	Out in the water, in the middle of the ocean, is<strong> open sea</strong> with no land for miles and miles.	OpIN sea.	When you are on the<strong> OPEN SEA</strong>, you are completely <em>in</em> the <em>middle</em> of the <em>water</em>.		
汎		pan-	"The sense of the key word here is the ""all-inclusive"" we find in terms like ""<b>Pan-</b>American Games."" (It is also the character used in mathematics for ""partial"" as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a <i>water</i> sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region's most <i>mediocre</i> athletes, many of whom cannot even tread <i>water</i>. Now try to find a sponsor for the ""<b>Pan-</b><i>Mediocre</i> <i>Water</i> Sports Competition."""		6	147	2327	8	ハン、ブ、フウ、ホウ、ホン	ただよ.う、ひろ.い	"This is<strong> pan</strong>- as in the prefix meaning ""all"". I think of<strong> Pan</strong>gea as being a mediocre continent with water covering the rest of the planet. This was before it broke up into the first-class, well-distributed continents we got now."	Yeah, all our <em>water</em> is fairly <em>mediocre</em>, but if we work together in some<strong> pan</strong>-continental union, we can make some better <em>water</em>! As if.	After<strong> Pan</strong>-Am crashed yet another plane into the <em>water</em>, their reputation dropped to <em>mediocre</em>.	A person sneezes. The <em>water drops in the wind</em> are about to start a<strong> pan</strong>demic and put the whole world in<strong> pan</strong>demonium.	<strong>Pan-</strong>Am was such a lousy airline, even the <em>water</em> in their in-flight meals was <em>mediocre</em>.		
江		creek	Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the <b>creek</b> is often no more then a dribble of <i>water</i> trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of <i>water</i> is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how <b>creeks</b> are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of <i>water</i> somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The <b>creek</b> is thus a lesson in <i>water-craft</i>, as this kanji would agree.		6	148	139	8	コウ	え	A<strong> CREEK</strong> is a small trail of <em>water</em> easily <em>craft</em>ed with a stick.	<strong>Creek</strong>s are small water, easily crossed with a simple i-beam.	Using <em>water</em> and some <em>craft</em>, one can make a<strong> creek</strong>.	"This Kanji can carry the meaning of ""creek"", ""inlet"", or ""bay"" actually. Although the meaning of inlet and bay seem to pop up for me more than instances of it meaning<strong> creek</strong> (I often question Hesig's choices of these key words, even if his method does seem to be effective). Still… I guess right now I'm using the image of a witch who practices her ""craft"" next to a watery<strong> creek</strong> leading into an inlet/bay."	It is best to practice operating <em>water</em> <em>craft</em> in a<strong> creek</strong> before going to rivers or the sea…		
汰		cleanse	This character can mean both to <b>cleanse</b> and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly <i>plump</i> going to a skinny spa whose medicinal <i>waters</i> promise to <b>cleanse</b> him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the <i>water</i>.		7	149	2316	8	タ、タイ	おご.る、にご.る、よな.げる	"I couldn't find any reference to this kanji as meaning<strong> cleanse</strong>. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰 （さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to 'select' so maybe Heisig meant<strong> cleanse</strong> in the ethnic sense here.. I'm going to use the keyword ""selection"", as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out."	<em>Water</em> is used to<strong> cleanse</strong> a <em>plump</em> man's colon.	If you are FAT, it takes more WATER to<strong> CLEANSE</strong> you.	"The <a href=""../v4/120.html"">plump</a> (#120 太) goes one a <strong>cleansing</strong> diet to restore his health. Each day he drinks his 3l of <em>water</em>, swim half a hour in <em>water</em>…"	"The very plump man selected the Japanese toilet seat which will<strong> cleanse</strong> him with water automatically since he's too fat to reach back and wipe… (consider herman's explanation and think of ""selection"")."		
汁		soup	"To make <b>soup</b>, one begins with <i>water</i> and then starts adding things to it, often leftovers from the icebox. This is how the thick <b>soup</b> or stew called ""seven-in-one"" is made. This kanji does it three better, giving us a <i>ten</i>-ingredient <b>soup</b>."		5	150	140	8	ジュウ	しる、-しる、つゆ	To make<strong> soup</strong> you just take <em>water</em> and <em>add</em> (+) the rest of your ingredients.	To make<strong> soup</strong> you just take <em>water</em> and <em>add</em> <em>ten</em> tasty ingredients.	Water and ten ingredients can become a good<strong> soup</strong>!	This<strong> soup</strong> is just water and needles - I can't eat this.	<em>Water</em> is <em>ten</em> times less tasty than<strong> soup</strong>.		
沙		grains of sand	"We have already learned the kanji for <i>sand</i> (Frame 122), so let's use it to remember the character for <b>grains of sand</b>. Instead of the ""few stones"" that make for nice sand, here we have a <i>few drops of water</i>, one for each <b>grand of sand</b> - a beach in perfect ecological balance."		7	151	2296	8	サ、シャ	すな、よなげる	"To keep this separated from <a href=""../v4/117.html"">sand</a> (#117 砂): <em>Water</em> erodes away stone a <em>few</em><strong> grains of sand</strong> at a time until there is no stone left."	Wet sand is simply sand but to see beautiful<strong> grains of sand</strong>, the <em>water</em> must be <em>few</em>.	Each <em>water</em> wave washes away a <em>few</em><strong> grains of sand</strong>.	"This kanji is used in a lot of girl’s names. 理沙 (りさ) <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E6%B2%99%E7%B9%94"">、沙織</a> (さおり) <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E6%B2%99%E7%99%BE%E5%90%88"">、沙百合</a> (さゆり). Maybe guys can think of this kind of like the classic advice there a lots of fish in <em>water</em>(ocean), lots of girls out there for you. You might think that it's hopeless and there are only <em>a few</em> girls out there, but girls are like<strong> grains of sand</strong>. Keep looking for the right one!"	Where there are many<strong> grains of sand</strong> there are <em>few</em> drops of <em>water</em>.		
潮		tide	Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own.... On the left is the <i>water</i> - that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for <i>morning</i> learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word <b>tide</b>, just think of it in connection with the character for <i>eventide</i> that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the <i>morning</i>-<b>tide</b>, its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own.		15	152	141	8	チョウ	しお、うしお	The morning<strong> tide</strong> is basically, well, WATER in the MORNING.	If it's not Eventide ( 汐 ) it must be <em>morning</em><strong> tide</strong>!	This is not the eventide, but the water of the morning<strong> tide</strong>.	The water rises with the morning<strong> tide</strong>.	Imagine falling asleep drunk on the beach, you wake up quickly in the morning as the water from the<strong> tide</strong> hits you and makes you wet.		
源		source	"With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see <i>water</i> and <i>meadow</i> in this character for <b>source</b>. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word ""surge"") and in popular usage, <b>source</b> suggests the place <i>water</i> comes from. In this kanji, it is under the <i>meadow</i>, where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little <i>springs</i>."		13	153	142	8	ゲン	みなもと	The <em>water</em> that flows from the <em>meadow</em> is the <strong>source</strong> of life for the wild antelope.	"The<strong> source</strong> of clean <em>water</em> is from the <a href=""../v4/134.html"">meadow</a> (#134 原): it comes from that <em>spring</em> at the bottom of the <em>cliff</em>. Pay no attention to Julie Andrews lying face down in <em>spring</em>. The water's clean. Trust me."	<em>Water</em> is the<strong> source</strong> of a <em>meadow</em>'s beauty.	Here the<strong> SOURCE</strong> of water is deep beneath the ground (<em>cliff</em>) - it seeps up, joins the water <em>springs</em>, flows through the meadow, and down the waterfall at the end. (NOTE- to keep <strong>spring</strong> (133) and<strong> source</strong> separate, remember that a spring can be anywhere above ground; but the<strong> source</strong> of water is deep beneath the ground (<em>cliff</em>), and flows up through the ground to join springs and streams - which is why there are two primitives for <em>water</em> in this kanji).	Bottled <em>water</em> companies assure us that the<strong> source</strong> of their water is from some beautiful <em>meadow</em>-spring in the Swiss Alps, but we all know they just bottle up tap water.		
活		lively	When we speak of a <b>lively</b> personality or a <b>lively</b> party, we immediately think of a lot of chatter. This kanji depicts the idea of <b>lively</b> by having <i>tongues</i> babble and splash around like flowing <i>water</i>.		9	154	143	8	カツ	い.きる、い.かす、い.ける	I'm sure I can get her pretty<strong> lively</strong> and <em>wet</em> using my <em>tongue</em>.	"Conversations can become more<strong> lively</strong> after everyone has had a few drinks. It's because ""<em>water</em>y <em>tongue</em>s"" loosen lips!"	This keyword makes me think of animals. I picture a big dog running through the grass, saliva dripping from his tongue.	Water comes off the<strong> lively</strong> speaker's tongue.	<strong>Lively</strong> tongues need water.		
消		extinguish	Among the many things <i>water</i> is useful for is <b>extinguishing</b> fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the <i>water</i> at the left as the <i>drops of water</i> that are used to depict <i>water</i> in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to <b>extinguish</b> a fire would be to see that each <i>drop of water</i> hits one <i>spark</i> of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of utopian fire fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives.		10	155	144	8	ショウ	き.える、け.す	To<strong> extinguish</strong> a SPARK, you need WATER.	You need a few drops of water to<strong> extinguish</strong> the candle.	To <strong>extinguish</strong> fire, use <em>water</em> or something <em>resembling</em> it.	Each <em>drop of water</em><strong> extinguish</strong>es a <em>spark</em> from the fire, causing the campfire to eventually <strong>dissapear</strong>, with the <em>moon</em> remaining the only thing sure ( しょう) to(き) keep it light.	Use <em>water</em> to<strong> extinguish</strong> that <em>spark</em> before it gets out of hand.		
況		but of course	"This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrase sand sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase <b>but of course</b>. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a <i>teenager</i>, and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. ""Did you have a good shower?"" ""<b>But of course</b>,"" you reply, annoyed. So <i>water</i> and <i>teenager</i> combine to give us <b>but of course</b>."		8	156	145	8	キョウ	まし.て、いわ.んや、おもむき	"If you ask your <em>teenager</em> if what he's drinking is <em>water</em> (and not Vodka), he will answer ""but of course""."	"キョウ<strong> But of course</strong>, this character really means ""situation/condition"". ""Elder brother gulped some water and said, 'What the hell was Heisig's mental CONDITION when he came up with this definition? Heisig must have a drinking CONDITION.<strong> But of course</strong>, if Heisig sticks to water, rather than sake (like me, <em>water</em> quaffing, situation assessing, sober <em>elder brother</em>), his SITUATION may improve.'""　[MODEL COMPOUND: 状況 (じょうきょう)　state of affairs; conditions]."	A wet teenager is good ,<strong> but of course</strong> it is illegal.	Would you like to throw <em>water</em> on your <em>elder brother</em>? <strong>But of course</strong>!	"This kanji is actually used the normally in the words "" 況して "" and "" 況や "", which mean ""Even more so…"" or ""Even less so…"" depending on the context. So, everyone should use <em>water</em> to clean themselves, <em>even more so</em> <em>teenagers</em> prone to body odors."		
河		river	"The character in this frame represents a step up from the <i>stream</i> we met in Frame 134; it is a full-sized <b>river</b>. The <i>water</i> to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the <i>can</i> at the right tells us that our ""little engine that <i>could</i>"" has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat."		8	157	146	8	カ	かわ	A<strong> river</strong> CAN exist only if there is WATER.	I kept confusing this with <em>stream</em>. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial<strong> river</strong>. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow<strong> River</strong> in China ( 黄河 ), and the other is the Milky Way ( 銀河 ). Now I either think of the Little Engine that <em>could</em> dragging a bunch of stuff down a<strong> river</strong> in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.	"""I CAN has WATER?"" sez<strong> river</strong>cat."	With enough <em>water</em> you <em>can</em> make a<strong> river</strong>.	The lesson of persistence: even drops of <em>water can</em> become a<strong> RIVER</strong>.		
泊		overnight	When you stop at an inn for an <b>overnight</b> rest, all you expect is a bit of <i>water</i> for a wash and a set of clean <i>white</i> sheets to wrap your weary bones in.		8	158	147	8	ハク	と.まる、と.める	Please supply a guest who stays<strong> overnight</strong> with WATER and WHITE sheets.	When I go to an <strong>OVERNIGHT</strong> party, all I need is a bit of <strong>water</strong> and some of that hard <strong>white</strong>. (crack). (not really, but come on. much easier to recall than white sheets).	<strong>Overnight</strong> water white (it rhymes).	I asked the soaking wet white girl to stay<strong> overnight</strong>.	If you let your daughter's boyfriend stay<strong> overnight</strong>, expect white drops of water to be in unsettling places. (Sorry if this offends anyone.).		
湖		lake	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>old</i> . . . <i>flesh</i>. You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too old to work. Well, here is a legend about people being set adrift in the <i>waters</i> of a stormy <b>lake</b> because their <i>flesh</i> had gotten too <i>old</i> to bear the burdens of life.		12	159	148	8	コ	みずうみ	This is my favorite story. Simply associate the sad moment of an OLD person, standing near the WATER of the<strong> lake</strong> and looking at the MOON reflected in the<strong> lake</strong>. The created primitives themselves are put so beautifully, that you will not forget this kanji.	Water reflects the old moon in the<strong> lake</strong>.	Water + old + flesh. Imagine a group of senior citizens skinnydipping in a nearby<strong> lake</strong>.	"Tip: Heisig later combines <em>old</em> and <em>moon</em> into 胡 <a href=""../v4/2470.html"">uncivilized</a> (#2470 胡). Story: Drinking <em>water</em> straight from the<strong> lake</strong> is rather <em>uncivilized</em>. (OR: <em>Uncivilized</em> communities get their <em>water</em> straight from the<strong> lake</strong>."	Some<strong> lake</strong>s are used by criminals to dump <em>old</em> <em>body parts</em> in the <em>water</em>.		
測		fathom	"Connoting the measurement of the depth of <i>water</i>, the keyword <b>fathom</b> begins with the <i>water</i> primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for <i>rule</i> (Frame 92) which we learned in the sense of a ""ruler"" or ""measure."" Hence, when we <i>rule</i> <i>water</i> we <b>fathom</b> it. What could be simpler? But be careful; its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself <b>fathoming</b> a body of <i>water</i> several hundred feet deep by using a <i>ruler</i> of gargantuan proportions."		12	160	149	8	ソク	はか.る	A <em>fathom</em> is the unit you use when making <strong>rules</strong> about <strong>water</strong>'s depth.	You can't<strong> fathom</strong> how deep this <em>water</em> is. Perhaps you should use a <em>ruler</em> to measure it?	Imagine jumping in the water and riding a shellfish down to the bottom, measuring<strong> fathom</strong>s with your ruler.	<strong>Fathom</strong>s beneath the <em>water</em>, a <em>shellfish</em> defends the depths with his <em>sabre</em>.	"HINT: I find 測 and 則 confusing. For 則 <a href=""../v4/88.html"">rule</a> (#88 則)Heisig describes the keyword as a rule (regulation). Then in <a href=""../v4/149.html"">fathom</a> (#149 測) he suggests 則 is a ruler or measure! Whatever stories you choose, don't loose sight of the meaning: 則 = rule (regulation, law), 測 =<strong> fathom</strong> (measure, conjecture)."		
土		soil	I don't like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of <b>soil</b> piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try.	* As a primitive, the sense of <i>soil</i> is extended to that of <i>ground</i> because of its connection with the kanji for the same (Frame 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of <i>dirt</i> and <i>land</i>.	3	161	150	8	ド、ト	つち	Remembering<strong> soil</strong> is easy. If<strong> soil</strong> is soft, you can take a <em>walking stick</em> and plunge it two* feet into the ground.	The grave was marked by a cross sticking out of the<strong> soil</strong>.	<strong>Soil</strong> is neither positive nor negative.	King Arthur pulled the magical sword Excalibur out of the hardened<strong> soil</strong> to claim his place as king.	I tried to stick a <em>needle</em> in the <em>ground</em> but it wouldn't go through the hard<strong> SOIL</strong>.		
吐		spit	We have here a rather small <i>mouth</i> (it is always compressed when set on the left) next to a much larger piece of <i>dirt</i>. It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a <i>mouth</i> full of <i>dirt</i>. As least I know what I would do: <b>spit</b> it out as fast and far as I could!		6	162	151	8	ト	は.く、つ.く	<strong>SPIT</strong> goes from my MOUTH to the GROUND.	The only things that come out of my MOUTH and onto the GROUND are<strong> spit</strong> and vomit. Everything else (words, song) floats on the air.	"Means <em>vomit</em> as well. a more decent way to say what you thow up could be ""<em>mouth</em> <em>soil</em>""."	When you get <em>dirt</em> in your <em>mouth</em>, you have to <strong>spit</strong> it out.	Usually when people<strong> SPIT</strong>, it's because something is LEFT IN THEIR MOUTH … In that case, they just<strong> spit</strong> it out.. RIGHT on the GROUND!		
圧		pressure	One of the things that causes the erosion of <i>soil</i> is the excessive <b>pressure</b> of the top<i>soil</i> on the lower <i>soil</i>. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep <i>cliff</i> without a tree in sight. The <b>slightest</b> pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character.		5	163	152	8	アツ、エン、オウ	お.す、へ.す、おさ.える、お.さえる	The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous<strong> pressure</strong>.	For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives.	The <em>cliff</em> exerts a lot of<strong> pressure</strong> on the <em>ground</em> beneath it.	The taller the <em>cliff</em>, the more<strong> pressure</strong> on the <em>soil</em> below it.	Be careful of landslides! The <em>soil</em> under the <em>cliff</em> is under enormous<strong> PRESSURE</strong>.		
埼		cape	The <b>cape</b> pictured here is a jut of <i>land</i> like <b>Cape</b> Cod. The <i>soil</i> on the left tells us we have to do with <i>land</i>, and the <i>strange</i> on the right tells us it is a <b><i>cape</i></b> where unusual things go on. Put a haunted house on it, an eerie sky overhead, and a howling wind rustling through the trees, and you have yourself a picture of <b>Cape</b> <i>Strange</i> (or, if you prefer, <b>Cape</b> <i>Odd</i>).		11	164	153	8	キ	さき、さい、みさき	This refers to LAND, not the STRANGE gear superheroes wear.	"<strong>Cape</strong> Cod ""odd"" is a land where odd=strange things happen."	A<strong> CAPE</strong> is a piece of LAND that stands out STRANGLY in the sea.	It's quite strange. When I go to<strong> Cape</strong> Odd, I always end up soiling myself!	What the hell does the NASA do at<strong> Cape</strong> Canaveral? The <em>soil</em> there looks kinda <em>strange</em>…		
垣		hedge	The <b>hedge</b> depicted in this frame is the miraculous <b>hedge</b> of briar roses that completely <i>spanned</i> the castle <i>grounds</i> in which Sleeping Beauty lay for a hundred years, so that none but her predestined beloved could find his way through it.		9	165	154	8	エン	かき	Before the Great Wall of China, there was a dirt<strong> hedge</strong> that spanned across.	The<strong> HEDGE</strong> of roses growing from the castle <em>grounds</em> fully <em>spanned</em> the castle walls.	The<strong> HEDGE</strong> spans the <strong>GROUNDS</strong> of the estate.	The entire grounds were spanned by a<strong> hedge</strong>.	The kanji also means a fence. Think of a dirt wall that spans your property. 石垣 = いしがき = stone wall.		
填	塡	inlay	When we hear the world <b>inlay</b>, we usually think of setting precious stones in pieces of jewelery, but the primitive elements here suggest <i>truth</i> being <b>inlaid</b> in the <i>soil</i>. You might think instead of the cosmic wisdom that <b>inlaid</b> the <i>truth</i> of the universe in the stuff of the earth.		13	166	2190	8	テン、チン	は.まる、は.める、うず.める、しず.める、ふさ.ぐ	In a hole in the <em>ground</em>, the body of the victim was placed. And then the killer <strong>stuffed it up</strong> so that the <em>truth</em> would not be found out, he hoped.	I stuffed up his mouth with dirt to keep the truth from coming out.	There is no <em>ground</em>s for what you are saying. It's not <em>true</em>. You're just making <strong>stuff up</strong>. I ought to <strong>stuff up</strong> your mouth to make you STFU.	The <em>ground</em> appeared <strong>stuffed up</strong> with with random deposits, or was it <strong>inlaid</strong> with the <em>truth</em> of the universe?	I STUFFED DIRT into his mouth to keep the TRUTH from coming to out.		
圭		squared jewel	Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, <b>square jewel</b>, depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of <i>soil</i> on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays.	"* As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean <i>ivy</i>, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the <i>ground</i> to form a sort of ""second"" <i>ground</i> that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping."	6	167	155	8	ケイ、ケ		Piling <em>SOIL</em> upon <em>SOIL</em> for aeons is how<strong> SQUARE JEWEL</strong>S are formed deep in the earth.	How would you stop someone stealing your biggest<strong> square jewel</strong>? Bury it deep in the <em>soil</em> under <em>ground</em>. Then plant <em>ivy</em> to mark the spot.	Layering <em>soil</em> over <em>soil</em> can create many things, from precious<strong> SQUARE JEWEL</strong>S to lush beds of <em>ivy</em>.	The pirate wanted to hide his<strong> square jewel</strong> well. So, he buried it in the <em>soil</em>, under the <em>ground</em> and planted poison <em>ivy</em> over the spot.	Soil upon Soil compressed to make Diamond<strong> Square Jewel</strong>s.		
封		seal	Think of the key word <b>seal</b> as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax <b>seal</b>, you <i>glue</i> a sprig of <i>ivy</i> on the outside. In this way the elements <i>ivy</i> and <i>glue</i> give you a curious and memorable way to <b>seal</b> your secret letters.		9	168	156	8	フウ、ホウ		The king used a special<strong> seal</strong> of ivy leaves glued onto his document.	A bit of <em>ivy</em> <em>glued</em> to a letter can make a lovely<strong> SEAL</strong> when in a pinch, says Martha Stewart.	<em>Squared jewels</em> with the right <em>measure</em>ments receive the jeweler's <strong>seal</strong> of approval.	Be careful with the order. FIRST you wrap it up in <em>ivy</em>, THEN you<strong> seal</strong> it with <em>glue</em>.	Think of an old book of magic, <strong>seal</strong>ed to prevent it from harming the uninitiated. The <strong>seal</strong>ing spell is contained in a <em>square jewel</em> which is <em>glue</em>d to the cover. The cover of the book possibly also has an <em>ivy</em> motif embossed in the cracked leather. 封 ふう sea; 封筒 ふうとう envelope; 封切る ふうぎる release a film; 封建 ほうけん feudalistic.		
涯		horizon	"After seeing a constant <b>horizon</b> of <i>water</i>, <i>water</i> everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the <i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i> of land on a new <b>horizon</b>? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact <i>ivy</i>, but the phrase ""<i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i>"" has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details."		11	169	157	8	ガイ	はて	Try to reverse Heisig's story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies. From your prison ontop the ivy clad cliff all you can see in the distant<strong> horizon</strong> is nothing but water.	From the water, I can see the ivy-clad-cliffs on the<strong> horizon</strong>.	Over the WATER and past the<strong> HORIZON</strong> there is said to be a CLIFF that holds a very rare JEWEL.	Across the <em>water</em>, I can see <em>ivy</em> covered <em>cliffs</em> on the<strong> horizon</strong>.	"Since Hesig doesn't have another Kanji with the keyword of ""shore"" it might be worth pointing out to folks here that this is the alternate meaning for this kanji asides from<strong> horizon</strong>. Also meshes well with Hesig's story spotting those Ivy clad Cliffs on the<strong> horizon</strong>. Spotting green and beautiful shore-land off in the distance across the water!!"		
寺		Buddhist temple	"You have heard of people ""attaching"" themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a <b>Buddhist temple</b> with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused <i>land</i> around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with <i>glue</i>, steps down firmly, and so joins the <b>Buddhist temple</b> as a ""permanent member."""		6	170	158	8	ジ	てら	At the<strong> Buddhist temple</strong> the monks are seated on the <em>ground</em>, <em>glued</em> there in meditation.	To be allowed to join the<strong> Buddhist temple</strong>, imagine an aspiring monk being asked to stand still in the <em>soil</em> for a long time in a <em>measurement</em> of his resolve.	How long a<strong> BUDDHIST TEMPLE</strong> has stood on its <em>grounds</em> is often a <em>measure</em> of its worth.	The Buddhist in the temple sit on the <em>ground</em> for years contemplating life, the universe, and everything. Not because they want to but because someone switched the floor wax with <em>superglue</em>.	[ <strong>Buddhist temple</strong> = <em>soil</em> / <em>glue</em> ] - in a <strong>Buddhist temple</strong>, you can free yourself of the <em>earth</em> that <em>glues</em> you to this world.		
時		time	"""What is <b>time</b>?"" asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. ""Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you."" Here we have the kanji's answer to that perennial riddle. <b>Time</b> is a <i>sun</i> rising over a <i>Buddhist temple</i>. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character."		10	171	159	8	ジ	とき、-どき	When the SUN starts to shine on the TEMPLE, it's<strong> time</strong> to get up.	In ancient Japan,<strong> TIME</strong> of ''day'' was announced at the ''buddhist temples''. They did this by ringing large iron bells. This is similar to churches who ring their bells to announce the<strong> time</strong> of day.	A <em>day</em> at a <em>Buddhist temple</em> is<strong> TIME</strong> well spent.	You will fully understand the concept of<strong> time</strong> if you spend a <em>day</em> in a <em>Buddhist temple</em>.	<strong>Time</strong> is marked by the sun at buddhist temples.		
均		level	The <b>level</b> this key word refers to is not the carpenter's tool but rather the even surface of a thing. It pictures <i>soil</i> being scooped up into a <i>ladle</i> and then made <b>level</b> (apparently because one is measuring <i>soil</i>). The excess <i>drops of soil</i> are brushed off the top, which accounts for the added <i>drop</i> at the <i>ladle's</i> edge.		7	172	160	8	キン	なら.す	<em>Soil</em> is scooped up into a <em>ladel</em>. The extra <em>drop</em> is brushed off to make it<strong> level</strong>.	To remember the extra stroke in the ladle, make a vivid image of a big drop of excess soil fr0m the ladle falling out onto the ground when you<strong> level</strong> it.	匀 = equal, not ladle 勺 = ladle. > so the story would be equal soil is equal to<strong> level</strong>ed ground.	Kids like scooping <em>dirt</em> with plastic <em>ladles</em> when making mud pies and often sweep off the extra <em>bits of dirt</em> to get it exactly<strong> LEVEL</strong>.	Per LIVELLARE il SUOLO, prendi il MESTOLO e rimuovi quel BRICIOLO/GOCCIA di terreno in piú.		
火		fire	Just as sitting before a <b>fire</b> enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of <b>fire</b> you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.	* To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a <i>fireplace</i> (or <i>hearth</i>) or a raging <i>conflagration</i> like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning. Another primitive element for <i>fire</i>, based on this one, is written as 4 small drops and will mean <i>flames</i>, <i>cauldron</i>, <i>cooking fire</i>, or an <i>oven fire</i>.	4	173	161	8	カ	ひ、-び、ほ-	For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on<strong> fire</strong>!	A tepee getting shot at by<strong> fire</strong> arrows.	To be honest, it just looks like the flames of a<strong> fire</strong> to me.	Looks like a flame of a campfire with two <em>drops of</em> sparks flying off.	A<strong> FIRE</strong>bender from Avatar, wielding flames in both hands.		
炎		inflammation	A <i>fire</i> belongs IN the <i>hearth</i>, not OVER it. When the <i>fire</i> spreads to the rest of the house, we have an <b>inflamed</b> house. And as with any <b>inflammation</b> - including those that attack our bodies - the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of element for <i>fire</i>, one atop the other.		8	174	162	8	エン	ほのお	To fight <strong>fire</strong> with <strong>fire</strong> would just <strong>inflame</strong> a situation.	An<strong> inflammation</strong> can often feel like FIRE upon FIRE burning.	If you have an<strong> INFLAMMATION</strong>, it feels like there's <em>fire</em> above and below your skin.	"""Inflammable means flammable? What a country!"" - from the Simpsons. Saying both flammable and inflammable helps you remember that there are two fires.<strong> Inflammation</strong> and inflammable have almost the same spelling."	When you suffer from a bad<strong> inflammation</strong>, i.e. an infection, your body will fight it with a high fever. So it fights <em>fire</em> with <em>fire</em>.		
煩		anxiety	The existential condition of <b>anxiety</b> that arises from the inevitable frustration of our worldly passions is contained in this character. The <i>head</i> is set <i>afire</i>, causing deep torment of spirit (and a whopper of a headache).		13	175	163	8	ハン、ボン	わずら.う、わずら.わす	An<strong> anxiety</strong> feels like FIRE in the HEAD.	Imagine the<strong> anxiety</strong> a librarian would feel if the library caught <em>fire</em> and all the <em>pages</em> of his books were burning up.	"Many performers get ""Michael Jackson<strong> anxiety</strong>"" wherein they fear their head will catch on fire."	"In ancient times, they said<strong> anxiety</strong> was cause by ""fire in the head."" Picture doctors prescibing many different crazy/silly ways to get the fire out of the patient's head. Now picture it like your watching a documentary on the History Channel about it. Not going to forget it anytime soon now. :)."	I would be feeling<strong> anxiety</strong> too if there was a <em>fire</em> on my <em>head</em>!		
淡		thin	The primitives in this kanji read: <i>water</i> . . . <i>inflammation</i>. Taking <i>inflammation</i> in its medical sense, the first <i>water</i>-related <i>inflammation</i> that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very <b>thin</b>. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very <b>thin</b> chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being <i>inflamed</i> with) dehydration (hence the element for <i>water</i>).		11	176	164	8	タン	あわ.い	Drink <em>water</em> and <em>burn twice</em> as many calories as you eat… you'll definitely get<strong> thin</strong>. Imagine inside your body, all those calories literally being <em>burned</em> from above and below… THAT's what it takes to become<strong> thin</strong>.	<strong>Thin</strong> girls are twice as hot when they're wet.	To become<strong> thin</strong>, simply go into a sauna. It may be as hot as a <em>conflagration</em>, but you'll sweat (<em>water</em>) and lose 10 pounds.	Adding <em>water</em> to an <em>inflammation</em> sure will make it a <strong>thin</strong> <em>fire</em>.	Water + Fire over fire Faint, pale, fleeting, dim. (NOT<strong> THIN</strong>!) I remember it using its kun yomi : awa(i), because i see volcanic islands with water around. Yes Hawaii… (the kanji key whose keyword is dilute actually means<strong> thin</strong>).		
灯		lamp	Since it is very hard to read by the <i>fireplace</i> without going blind from the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat, our ancestors invented a way to <i>nail</i> down a bit of that <i>fire</i>, just enough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and no more. Voilà! The <b>lamp</b>.		6	177	165	8	トウ	ひ、ほ-、ともしび、とも.す、あかり	Imagine old gas<strong> lamp</strong>s which had a <em>flame</em> to light up the <em>street signs</em>.	A<strong> lamp</strong> is <em>fire</em> you can hang from a <em>nail</em>.	When this symbol was created, a<strong> lamp</strong> was simply a <em>fire</em> at the side of the <em>street</em>.	<em>Warning: This story is graphic.</em> In Rome, after the Third Servile War, the losing rebels were crucified (on T shaped crosses) and set <em>on fire</em> along the <em>road</em> back to Rome. These human<strong> lamp</strong>s lit up the massive <em>road</em> with burning corpses as a reminder not to lose against the Romans. Thanks Latin 3!	A long time ago they used <em>fire</em> for <em>street</em><strong> lamp</strong>s.		
畑		farm	Looking at the primitives, a <i>fireplace</i> and a <i>rice field</i>, we find the essential ingredients for a <b>farm</b>: a warm <i>hearth</i> to sit by at night, and a well-plowed <i>field</i> to grow one's crops in by day.		9	178	166	8		はた、はたけ、-ばたけ	Many<strong> farm</strong>s are created by first setting FIRE over the land to clear the land for the FIELDS.	When creating a <strong>farm</strong>, the prospective <strong>farm</strong>er must first set <em>fire</em> to the forest to clear the ground. Only then can he plow the <em>fields</em>. <em>Fire</em> before <em>fields</em> to make a <strong>farm</strong>.	This kanji actually makes a boatload of sense. In Japan, rice<strong> farm</strong>ers are constantly making little fires on their rice<strong> farm</strong>s burning up all the old stalks and things probably to be used as fertilizer. In moving to Japan, I found this practice to be very new and odd to me. So I would venture to guess that's exactly where this kanji comes from. If not, it certainly makes it really easy to remember.	Crap! the <em>field</em> in our neighbour's<strong> farm</strong> is on <em>fire</em>!	On a Japanese<strong> farm</strong>, <em>fire</em> is often set to the <em>rice</em> fields (after harvest).		
災		disaster	Of all of nature's <b>disasters</b>, this kanji picks out two of the worst: <i>floods</i> and <i>fires</i>. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature's solution to nature's own problem: a great <i>flood</i> pouring down over a great forest <i>fire</i>.		7	179	167	8	サイ	わざわ.い	What a<strong> disaster</strong>! First a FIRE, then on top of it came FLOODs.	Don't know about Japan, but here in Australia, flooding rivers and bushfires are the most common natural<strong> disaster</strong>s.	Godzilla pissing a <em>stream</em> of <em>fire</em> all over Tokyo. That is a<strong> disaster</strong>!	<em>C</em>-autioun-<em>C</em>-aution-<em>C</em>-aution: because of the <em>fire</em> this is now a<strong> disaster</strong> area.	There's a flood upstairs, and a fire in the basement. I think it's safe to say that this is a<strong> disaster</strong>.		
灰		ashes	The kanji for <b>ashes</b> naturally includes the primitive for <i>fire</i>, or more specifically, a <i>fireplace</i>. Now what do you do with that bucket of <b>ashes</b> you have just cleaned out of the <i>fireplace</i>? You walk to the edge of a <i>cliff</i> and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the <i>fire</i>, once it has turned to <b>ashes</b>, ends up at the bottom of the <i>cliff</i>.		6	180	168	8	カイ	はい	The <em>fire</em> underneath the <em>cliff</em> will eventually turn everything above to<strong> ashes</strong>.	After the cremation <em>fire</em>, many prefer to scatter their loved-one's<strong> ASHES</strong> from seaside <em>cliffs</em>.	"Scene from ""The Big Lebowski"" : Walter scatters Donny's<strong> ashes</strong>, but a wind blows much of the<strong> ashes</strong> into ""The Dude"" Lebowski's face. Upset, The Dude lashes out at Walter. Walter apologizes and hugs The Dude, before suggesting ""Fuck it, man. Let's go bowling."" I bet you that The Dude wanted to cremate (<em>fire</em>) Walter right there and then, at the top of the <em>cliff</em>! (thanks Elktapestry)."	After <em>fire</em> erupts from under the <em>cliff</em>s (volcano) everything is covered in<strong> ashes</strong>. Thnx khooks!	After fire erupts from the ground (volcano) the cliffs will be covered in<strong> ashes</strong>.		
点		spot	If you look into the flickering of a <i>fire</i> for a long time and then turn aside, you will see <b>spots</b> before your eyes. Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before - as least as far as know, they didn't - imagine using those <b>spots</b> as a technique for <i>fortune-telling</i>. The old witch sits before her <i>cauldron</i> and watches the <b>spots</b> that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that <i>tells your fortune</i>. Think of it as a kind of <b>spot</b>-check on your future.		9	181	169	8	テン	つ.ける、つ.く、た.てる、さ.す、とぼ.す、とも.す、ぼち	The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the<strong> spot</strong> because she was accused of being a witch.	You have to stimulate the G-spot with your <em>magic wand</em> in order to get her on <em>fire</em>. Or you can juste use your <em>mouth</em>…	The <em>Fortune Teller</em> stares into an <em>Campfire</em> until she sees <strong>SPOTS</strong>. She then interprets those<strong> spot</strong>s in the same manner than another fortune teller would look at tea leaves or the bumps on your head.	"Alternate meaning of the kanji is <strong>mark</strong>, or <strong>points</strong>. Like japanese tests are graded from 0 to 100 depending on how many <strong>percent</strong> of the questions they got correct. Before I learned any alternate meaning to this I took it as <strong>percentage</strong> = statistics. Now, wouldn't some pure and concrete <strong>statistics</strong> be just the thing you need to set that <em>fortune tellers</em> mind on <em>fire</em>? Relate the setting him/her on fire to the entry for <a href=""../v4/163.html"">anxiety</a> (#163 煩) if it helps. :)."	"""Out damn<strong> spot</strong>!"" Yelled the crazy <em>fortune teller</em> as she leaped into the <em>fire</em>. I guess thats not quite how it happened in Hamlet though, so I got a low <strong>mark</strong> on my English test."		
照		illuminate	Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for <b>illuminate</b> can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something <i>shine</i>. If you glaze a pot and put it into the <i>oven</i> to <i>fire</i> it, you in fact <i>illuminate</i> it. Hence the kanji for <b>illuminate</b> compares the kanji for <i>shining</i> with the primitive element for the <i>oven's fire</i>.		13	182	170	8	ショウ	て.る、て.らす、て.れる	SHINING FLAMES<strong> illuminate</strong>!	The sun was seduced to give us fire, by which we<strong> illuminate</strong> the night.	Just <em>shining</em> is not enough to<strong> illuminate</strong>. The shiny thing needs to be even brighter. Maybe set it on <em>fire</em>?	You find yourself trapped in an unfamiliar cavern, engulfed in darkness. You wield a Rod of Light with your right hand; its tip is <em>shining</em>, but faintly. Thence, with your other hand, you cast a spell and set <em>fire</em> to the rod. And this rod, which shines with much greater fervour than before, is what would <strong>illuminate</strong> a path before you, that you then follow until you reach the outer caverns.	The man who shines shoes in the day stands alone at night in the cold, dark city. He keeps himself warm in front of a burning trash barrel, his face <strong>illuminated</strong> by the flames.		
魚		fish	The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>rice field</i> . . . <i>cooking fire</i>. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a <b>fish</b> is caught and <i>bound up</i> on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the <i>rice fields</i> for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a <i>cooking fire</i> for his supper.		11	183	171	8	ギョ	うお、さかな、-ざかな	The elements of this kanji are bound up, rice field and cooking fire. When I think of bound up cooked rice, it makes me think of sushi, which in turn brings to mind<strong> fish</strong>.	<em>Bind</em> that<strong> FISH</strong> and <em>cook</em> his <em>brains</em>! Yarhh!	That<strong> fish</strong> was caught, BOUND UP, then carried across RICE FIELDS, and finally cooked over an OVEN FIRE.	"Think of (cooked) salmon onigiri. The<strong> fish</strong> is <em>bound up</em> in <em>rice</em> and cooked over a <em>fire</em>… 魚 [さかな] <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E9%87%91%E9%AD%9A"">、金魚</a> [きんぎょ] <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E9%AD%9A%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4"">、魚市場</a> [おういちば]."	I like my<strong> fish</strong> <em>bound</em> with <em>rice</em> over a nice <em>fire</em>. Sushi!!		
漁		fishing	To the story we have just made about <i>fish</i>, this kanji for the profession of <b>fishing</b> adds yet another element BEFORE the others: namely the <i>water</i>, where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten. Be sure to get a clear image of the <i>water</i> when you put it all together.		14	184	172	8	ギョ、リョウ	あさ.る	You need WATER and FISH for<strong> fishing</strong>.	If you are confusing this with angling like me, take<strong> fishing</strong> to mean not the act of catching a <em>fish</em> but the act of being a <em>fish</em> not living but<strong> fishing</strong> (i.e. in the <em>water</em>).	"""FISHING For Idiots"", Chapter One: <em>Fish</em> are generally found in <em>water</em>."	What? The <em>fish</em>'s still in the <em>water</em>? Well, you better go <strong>fishing</strong> then!	<strong>Fishing</strong> is taking <em>fish</em> out of <em>water</em>.		
里		ri	"That's right - a <b><i>ri</i></b>. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One <b><i>ri</i></b> is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the <i>rice field</i>, and below the element for <i>land</i>. Those four sections you see in the <i>rice field</i> (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of <i>land</i>, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a ""country mile."" The <i>land</i> division based on the size of a <i>rice field</i> is called a <b><i>ri</i></b>."	* To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a <i>computer</i>, a meaning deriving from the kanji for <i>logic</i>, which we will meet in Lesson 12.	7	185	173	9	リ	さと	The<strong> ri</strong> is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a<strong> RI</strong>CE FIELD.	Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character. You'll save a lot (and I mean, a whole lot) of trouble later by giving it instead its intended meaning: <strong>House of the Parents</strong>.	It's not just any computer. It's an old Ata<strong>ri</strong>.	My <strong>parents' house</strong> is on a <em>rice field</em>; I <em>compute</em> the <em>ground</em> area being one <strong>ri</strong> by one <strong>ri</strong>. 古里 (ふるさと) : home town, birthplace, old village, historic village, native place, one's old home; 郷里 (きょうり) : birth-place, home town.	"It frustrates me that Hesig doesn't give any mention to another prominent meaning of the 里 /<strong> Ri</strong> Kanji being used for さと meaning a country village or home. perhaps he thought it would be too confusing for one to remember two different types of villages and distinguish this from 町 … however… If I think of that one as まち and this one as さと it keeps things straight in my head and allows me to skip the whole confusing path of thinking of this as a ""computer"" which just seems somewhat wrong."		
黒		black	Like most things electrical, a <i>computer</i>, too, can overheat. Just imagine <i>flames</i> pouring out of it and charring the keyboard, the monitor, and your desk a sooty <b>black</b> color.		11	186	174	9	コク	くろ、くろ.ずむ、くろ.い	If you burn the GROUND of a RICE FIELD with FIRE, eventually it will turn<strong> black</strong>.	If your <em>parent's home</em> catches on <em>fire</em>, it will turn<strong> black</strong>.	Computer-shomputer… this is a さと（ 里 ）being ravaged by fire… down into charred and burnt<strong> black</strong>ened remains!	Rice field … soil … fire.<strong> Black</strong> volcanic soil is perfect for growing rice. It is only logical that farmers regularly burn the brush on their fields in an attempt to imitate nature.	<em>Burning</em> a <em>computer</em> is <em>ri</em>-diculous. It just leaves everything all<strong> BLACK</strong>.		
墨		black ink	Besides meaning <b>black ink</b>, this kanji also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as one might used a chalked string. Here it is used to mark off the <i>dirt</i> with <i>black</i> lines for a foot ballgame (played, I presume, on a white field).		14	187	175	9	ボク	すみ	Theres BLACK on the GROUND…most likely someone spilt some<strong> black ink</strong>.	Anyone who has worked with laserjet ink cartridges will know the<strong> black ink</strong> looks like powdered dirt.	<strong>Black ink</strong> comes from <em>black</em> <em>soil</em>.	Charred bamboo is an essential ingredient in certain types of sumi ink. Imagine that the old さと that burnt down was composed primarily of bamboo houses and structures… thus, residents of the new さと often return to those old grounds to scoop up the charred remains from the soil in order to make thier<strong> black ink</strong>.	Before mixing with a liquid,<strong> black ink</strong> looks like <em>black</em> <em>soil</em>!		
鯉		carp	"These are the same <b>carp</b> you see in Japanese ""<b>carp</b> streamers."" Only here we find a small home <i>computer</i> or two strung on the line by a father anxious for his son not only to have the courage and determination of a <b>carp</b> swimming upstream, but also the efficiency and memory of a <i>computer</i>. Ugh."		18	188	176	9	リ	こい	Japanese<strong> carp</strong> are massive <em>fish</em> - they are measured in <em>ri</em>!	Robo<strong>carp</strong>!!! Part <em>fish</em>, part <em>computer</em>! Visualise him flapping and clanking down the street, with bullets richoting off his scaly armour.	The fish got<strong> carp</strong>al tunnel syndrome from the computer(I know it's lame but it's hard to find a good story for this).	In front of my <strong>parents' home</strong> is a <strong>fish</strong> pond full of <em>carp</em>.	Bad pun: Japanese<strong> carp</strong> are <em>fish</em> that grow RI-ly big! :-).		
量		quantity	Think of <b>quantity</b> as having to do with measuring time and distance, and the rest is simple: you have a quantity of time in the new day that begins with <i>nightbreak</i>, and a quantity of distance in the rural <i>ri</i>.		12	189	177	9	リョウ	はか.る	I did such a<strong> quantity</strong> of work that when NIGHT BREAK came, I was asleep on the COMPUTER.	If you find that by <em>nightbreak</em>, you're still playing at your <em>computer</em>, chances are your World of Warcraft character has a high<strong> quantity</strong> of levels. [thanks to ssmoler] ….. To remember that <em>nightbreak</em> appears ABOVE <em>computer</em>, think of looking UP from your computer at the window to realize you've been playing until nightbreak.	A<strong> quantity</strong> can be a measure of time or space (day/ri).	I have such a huge<strong> quantity</strong> of kanji to review that <em>night break</em> usually finds me in front of my <em>computer</em> reviewing the kanji.	At <em>nightbreak</em>, it's logical to check the<strong> quantity</strong> of porn you downloaded to your <em>computer</em> overnight.		
厘		rin	"No doubt you will find it in your heart to forgive me for forcing yet another Japanese word on you in this frame. It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One <b><i>rin</i></b> is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something ""very, very tiny."" The kanji shows a <i>cliff</i> with a <i>computer</i> under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home <i>computer</i> that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one <b><i>rin</i></b>!"		9	190	178	9	リン		I threw my<strong> Rin</strong>dows <em>computer</em> off a <em>cliff</em> because it kept crashing. Now, after its last crash, it's worth less than a<strong> rin</strong>.	A <em>computer</em> dropped off of a <em>cliff</em> would be worth about 1<strong> RIN</strong>.	The Square Root of 1 RI = 1<strong> RIN</strong>.	He dropped his <em>computer</em> from the top of the <em>cliff</em> and it turned to smithe-<strong> rin</strong> -s.	"Looking down at the 里 from the high cliff above such a tiny country village looks even smaller like something very very tiny and insignificant… Like a りん /<strong> Rin</strong>. Also might be worth-while to note now that this isn't just 1/10th of a 銭 but also 1/10th of a 分 or rather… 0.3mm in length. Perhaps imagine holding up a ruler from that high up to measure the tiny speck of a 里 below and note it coming out to 0.3mm in length. <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%81%9A%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8%E3%81%9A%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8%E5%B0%8F%E3%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%81%AD%EF%BD%9E"">ずっとずっと小さいですね～</a> !!"		
埋		bury	"When we speak of <b>burying</b> something (or someone, for that matter), we usually mean putting them under <i>ground</i>. Only here, we are <b>burying</b> our beloved <i>computer</i> that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the ""Dies irae, dies illa"" and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little <i>dirt</i> into what will be its final resting place.

When I die,<strong> bury</strong> me in the soil - next to my computer.		
同		same	"The primitives in this kanji show us <i>one</i> and <i>mouth</i> under a <i>hood</i>. Let us take the key word to connote the <b>sameness</b> that characterizes the life in community of the monk. They all have the <b>same</b> habits, including the ""habit"" they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's <i>cowl</i>, drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a <i>mouth</i>. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of <i>one mouth</i> under a <i>hood</i> as the kanji for the <b>sameness</b> of monastic life."	* As a primitive, this will mean <i>monks</i> dressed in a common habit.	6	192	180	9	ドウ	おな.じ	Muslim women wearing veils (HOOD) all look the<strong> same</strong>, you can just see ONE MOUTH and very little else.	Imagine monks wandering around the monastery. Covered in their <em>hoods</em> and chanting as if with <em>one mouth</em> they all look the<strong> same</strong> !	<em>One</em> <em>mouth</em> under a <em>hood</em> looks the<strong> same</strong> as any other.	"The cylon warriors all look the<strong> same</strong>: their <em>helmet</em> with their <em>one</em> glowing eye and their fixed <em>mouth</em>. (Now I can use ""cylon"" as an alternate keyword for this kanji!)."	Muslim women wearing veils (HOOD) all look the<strong> same</strong>, you can just see ONE MOUTH and a thin eye line.		
洞		den	"The key word <b>den</b> refers to an animal lair hollowed out in the side of a mountain. Now if we keep to the image of the monastic life as an image for <i>same</i>, we can picture a <b>den</b> of wild beasts dressed up in habits and living the common life in a mountain cavern. To bring in the element of <i>water</i> we need only give them a sacred ""puddle"" in the center of their <b>den</b>, the focus of all their pious attentions."		9	193	181	9	ドウ	ほら	All the animals in the<strong> den</strong> share the <em>same</em> <em>water</em>.	"""<strong>Den</strong>"" and ""<strong>cave</strong>"" also make me think of a <em>monk</em>'s cell. Monks take vows of silence and fast. So a <strong>den</strong> is where you'd find nothing but <em>water</em> (to drink) and a <em>monk</em>. 洞 ほら cave,<strong> den</strong>, grotto; 洞窟 どうくつ cave; 洞察 どうさつ discernment; insight."	Animals always build their<strong> den</strong> in the <em>same</em> place - beside the <em>water</em>.	All those <strong>caves</strong> were formed by <em>water</em>, and… they all look exactly the <em>same</em> to me!	There's a secret<strong> den</strong> in the monastery where some of the <em>monks</em> hold <em>water</em>-pistol fights.		
胴		trunk	"The word <b>trunk</b> refers to the <i>part of the body</i> that is left when you have ""<b>truncated</b>"" all the limbs. I can hardly think of any reason for doing so, unless one were lumberjacking corpses and needed to have them all properly pruned and made the <i>same</i> so they could be floated downstream without causing a <i>body</i>-jam."		10	194	182	9	ドウ		A<strong> trunk</strong>, a<strong> trunk</strong> // The <em>body</em> of a <em>monk</em> // The body of a monk in a<strong> trunk</strong>, a<strong> trunk</strong>.	Dead <em>flesh</em> all looks the <em>same</em> when you chop off everything but the<strong> trunk</strong>. Yes, I'm appalled at how gruesome this story is too.	The<strong> trunk</strong> (torso) of everyone's <em>body</em> is mostly the <em>same</em>.	Under the <strong>MOON</strong> the kinky <strong>MONKS</strong> bare their <strong>TRUNKS</strong>.	Your <strong>trunk</strong> (torso) is where the <em>body parts</em> meet at the <em>same place</em>.		
向		yonder	"Something referred to as ""over <b>yonder</b>"" is usually far off in the distance and barely within sight - like a wee <i>drop</i> in the distance - and is usually an expression used in giving directions or pointing something out. Hence this kanji begins with a <i>drop</i>. Then we find a sort of transparent <i>helmet</i> with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent <i>mouth</i> under it, obviously an extraterrestrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its <i>mouth</i> open like that? Why, about his spaceship way over <b>yonder</b> with its fuel tank on empty."		6	195	183	9	コウ	む.く、む.い、-む.き、む.ける、-む.け、む.かう、む.かい、む.こう、む.こう-、むこ、むか.い	Look over<strong> yonder</strong> ! That tiny <em>dot</em> is robin <em>hood</em> at the <em>mouth</em> of his secret cave !	There was an old woman named Wanda,// Who wanted to make herself blonder.// She covered her <em>くち</em>// With a <em>glass hood</em> from Gucci// And <em>drop</em>ped some hair dye on from<strong> yonder</strong>.	The spaceman died screaming, his <em>MOUTH</em> wide open because someone has cut the oxygen cable from the <em>HOOD/HELMET</em> of his space suit. As his last <em>DROPs</em> of oxygen escaped into the vastness of space he thought to himself, So much for flying off into the wild blue <em>YONDER</em>.	Over<strong> yonder</strong> usually refers to somewhere far away. For this kanji think of the aliens way over<strong> yonder</strong> who have an antenna popping out of their helmet which encloses but a single mouth.	<strong>Yonder</strong>….there is a <em>DOT</em> of light over the <em>mouth</em> of the <em>cave</em>.		
尚		esteem	Above we see the primitive for <i>little</i> attached to one of those <i>glass canopies</i> you might use to display a family heirloom. The <i>littleness</i> is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted <i>mouth</i> of an <b>esteemed</b> ancestor. We may be used to <b>esteeming</b> the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also <b>esteem</b> the very <i>mouth</i> that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece.		8	196	184	9	ショウ	なお	An especially<strong> esteem</strong>ed alien has three antennae on his helmet.	Remember that scene from Star Wars, where Luke is wearing that <em>helmet</em> that only his <em>mouth</em> could see, and was swinging at that <em>little</em> thing buzzing around the room? That was Obi-Wan's trick to get Luke to build his self-<strong>esteem</strong>, or his confidence in the Force.	Little self-esteem is the signature of mouthy teenagers wearing hoodies.	I have <em>little</em> self-esteem.. so I keep my face under a <em>hood</em> and my <em>mouth</em> shut.	I have a <em>small glass box</em> with a <em>mouth</em> inside. I hold this in great<strong> esteem</strong>, for it is the mouth of my ex and I did the world a great favor by stripping her of it.		
字		character	Here is the character for <b>character</b> itself. Not just kanji, but any written <b>character</b> from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a <i>child</i> in a <i>house</i>. But let us take advantage of the double-meaning of the key word to note that just as a <i>child</i> born to a Japanese <i>house</i> is given <b>characters</b> for its name, so it is also stamped with the <b>character</b> of those who raise it from infancy on.		6	197	185	9	ジ	あざ、あざな、-な	CHILDren learn Kanji<strong> character</strong>s underneath a HOUSE.	"""Why do I have to wear this roof on my head all the time father?"" ""Shut up! It builds<strong> character</strong>!""."	"The first kanji<strong> character</strong>s you will learn in Japan is probably learnt at home (in the <em>house</em> of your family) when you are still a <em>child</em>. Imagine a really small preschool child doing this (to prevent confusing house with school like in <a href=""../v4/324.html"">study</a> (#324 学))."	The way a child grows up in his house determines his<strong> character</strong>.	Imagine a child in his home (under the roof) sitting at the kitchen table practicing his kanji<strong> character</strong>s.		
守		guard	The notion of <b>guarding</b> something easily brings to mind the image of someone standing <b>guard</b>, like the royal soldiers in front of Buckingham Palace or the Pope's Swiss <b>Guard</b>. The whole idea of hiring <b>guards</b> is that they should stick like <i>glue</i> to your <i>house</i> to protect it from unwanted prowlers. So go ahead and <i>glue</i> a <b>guard</b> to your <i>house</i> in imagination.		6	198	186	9	シュ、ス	まも.る、まも.り、もり、-もり、かみ	"A<strong> GUARD</strong> is usually ""glued"" to the house he watches."	A<strong> guard</strong> provides a <em>measure</em> of security to those under a <em>roof</em>.	A good<strong> GUARD</strong> should stick to your <em>house</em> like <em>glue</em> and be willing to take any <em>measures</em> to protect you.	A good<strong> guard</strong> never leaves the <em>house</em> he watches over. He's practically <em>glued</em> to it.	A<strong> guard</strong> gives those under a roof a measure of security.		
完		perfect	"In order not to confuse the key word <b>perfect</b> with others nearly synonymous in meaning, pull it apart to have a look at its native Latin roots. <i>Per-factum</i> suggests something so ""thoroughly made or done"" that nothing more needs to be added to it. Now look at the kanji, which does something similar. We see a <i>house</i> that has been made <b>perfectly</b> from its <i>beginnings</i> in the foundation to the roof on the top. Now return to frame 101 and make sure not to confuse this key word with the kanji for <i>complete</i>."		7	199	187	9	カン		Make the<strong> perfect</strong> impression in the <em>beginning</em> by removing your shoes upon entering a Japanese <em>home</em>.	In the beginning, Adam and Eve had a home in Eden. It was<strong> perfect</strong>.	Their new <em>house</em> was the<strong> perfect</strong> place to <em>begin</em> a family.	At the <em>beginning</em> of the party the <em>house</em> was<strong> perfect</strong>. Now look at it!	My idea of<strong> perfect</strong> is just the <em>two</em> of us (<em>human legs</em>) under one <em>roof</em>. Like how it was <em>original</em>ly, <em>in the beginning</em> of our relationship. He <em>completes</em> me. 完全 [かんぜん] (adj-na,n)<strong> perfect</strong>ion, completeness, (P) 完璧 [かんぺき] (adj-na)<strong> perfect</strong>, complete, flawless, (P).		
宣		proclaim	"Under the primitive for <i>house</i> we meet the kanji for <i>span</i>. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching: ""<b>proclaiming</b> the good news to all nations"" and ""shouting it from the <i>housetops</i>."" That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising."		9	200	188	9	セン	のたま.う、のたま.わく	You can<strong> proclaim</strong> your opinions from the comfort of your HOUSE and have it SPAN the entire globe these days via The Internet.	I heard young Muslims have to memorise the Koran and<strong> proclaim</strong> it aloud as a kind of rite of passage. Imagine the SPAN of hours spent under a ROOF practising that! It must surely be worse than trying to get through Heisigs RTK - count yourself lucky.	"A local official<strong> proclaim</strong>s a curfew <em>spanning</em> sunset to sunrise - you must stay under your own <em>roof</em> during that time <em>span</em>. I keep wanting to add in the ""words"" 言 primitive. Don't think about someone reading it aloud - focus on the CURFEW that was<strong> proclaim</strong>ed. I also tend to confuse this one with <a href=""../v4/342.html"">imperial edict</a> (#342 詔). Remember this proclamation comes from a petty local official."	I keep thinking about the Irish one-hit band the<strong> Proclaim</strong>ers, who promised to walk 500 miles – quite a long SPAN – to reach your HOUSE.	<strong>Proclaim</strong> something loud enough that <strong>spans</strong> the <strong>roof</strong> tops.		
宵		wee hours	"As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep. It does this by picturing a <i>house</i> with a <i>candle</i> in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is ""burning the <i>candle</i> at both ends,"" and working night after night into the <b>wee hours</b>."		10	201	189	9	ショウ	よい	I burn the CANDLE in my HOUSE until the<strong> WEE HOURS</strong> reviewing the kanji!!!	"I agree with elktapestry. This kanji really means ""early evening"", not ""wee hours"" [Heisig really should have done his homework on this and several other characters (e.g., #145 ""but of course"" – what the hell???). Oh well.] ""Every <em>house</em> lights <em>candles</em> in the EARLY EVENING which stay lit until the<strong> wee hours</strong>"". E.G. 宵の口 （よいのくち）early evening; 今宵 （こよい）this evening; tonight."	The fixed definition of this Kanji that Hesig gives seems deceptive and misleading. This not only refers to<strong> wee hours</strong> of the morning but also Evening and Early Night. So it seems to span the whole range of times when one might need a candle to work within the confines of one's house without daylight. Shows me that I can never trust one source of information exclusively, especially not Hesig. I thank him for this sytem of memorization, but still…	In the log <em>house</em> the <strong>wee hours</strong> are spent studying by <em>candle</em>light.	In the<strong> wee hours</strong> I usually stay at <em>home</em> lit by a <em>candle</em> playing with my <em>little</em> bit of <em>flesh</em> until it bears <em>resemblance</em> to a <em>candle</em>.		
安		relax	To be told that the place of the <i>woman</i> is in the <i>house</i> may not sit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits the Chinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age. So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of <b>relaxing</b> after a hard day's work: the scruffy and weary <i>woman</i> of the <i>house</i> slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap.		6	202	190	9	アン	やす.い、やす.まる、やす、やす.らか	"It's funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive… well… if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman<strong> relax</strong>ing. Cheapest place to do that is in one's own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? <a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%AE%B6%E3%81%A7%E4%BC%91%E6%9A%87%E3%82%92%E5%8F%96%E3%82%8B%E3%81%AF%E5%AE%89%E3%81%84%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%81%AD%E3%80%82"">家で休暇を取るは安いですね。</a> ."	You can only<strong> relax</strong>, when you have woman under roof to do all chores.	Cheapest place for a woman to<strong> relax</strong> is in her own home.	"To me, this kanji has always meant ""cheap/inexpensive."" The way to remember this kanji is: A woman under a roof is cheap, because she isn't off spending your money! Now you'll never forget it!"	No one who has ever been to Japan could have failed to notice the<strong> relax</strong>ed life of the housewifes. While the husband slaves 14 hours a day at work, the <em>woman</em> of the <em>house</em> meets up with friends in cafes, takes piano lessons, goes shopping (no wonder Heizig didn't want to use <strong>cheap</strong> as keyword), watch TV dramas…oh, and take care of their 1.2 (and going down) children. A <em>woman</em> in a <em>house</em> is the perfect symbol for <em>relax</em>.		
宴		banquet	"To carry on from the last frame, we note the entire <i>day</i> of work that comes between a <i>woman</i> and her <i>house</i> in preparing for a dinner <b>banquet</b>, pictorially ""interrupting"" her <i>relaxation</i>."		10	203	191	9	エン	うたげ	The WOMAN spent all DAY preparing a<strong> banquet</strong> in the HOUSE.	Under the <em>roof</em>, all <em>day</em> long, the <em>woman</em> prepared for the<strong> banquet</strong> (this wording helps me remember the order of this kanji's elements).	The <em>woman</em> cannot relax 安 in her <em>house</em> because she only has one <em>day</em> to prepare a<strong> banquet</strong>.	An entire <em>day</em> of work for the<strong> banquet</strong> stands between the <em>woman</em> and the <em>relaxation</em> in her <em>house</em>.	To prepare for a<strong> BANQUET</strong>, you need to stay in the HOUSE whole DAY, and you need the help of a WOMAN!		
寄		draw near	Let the idea of <b>drawing near</b> suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a <i>strange house</i> - perhaps the haunted <i>House</i> of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread <i>House</i> that lured Hansel and Gretel to <b>draw near</b>.		11	204	192	9	キ	よ.る、-よ.り、よ.せる	"The <em>strange house</em> has a sign saying ""DRAW NEAR"" in its window, instead of a 'Beware' sign. It must be a trick!"	Imagine a horror movie set in a haunted mansion. The <em>house</em> is very <em>strange</em>. The characters<strong> draw near</strong> to one another for protection against the unknown.	There is something strange in this house. Do you dare to<strong> draw near</strong>?	Hans and Gretel slowly and carefully <strong>drew near</strong> the <em>strange</em> gingerbread <em>house</em> in the clearing.	As I<strong> draw near</strong>, I see something strang in the house.		
富		wealth	Here we have the original character on which the primitive element for <b>wealth</b> is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the <b>wealth</b> is kept under the roof of the same <i>house</i>.		12	205	193	9	フ、フウ	と.む、とみ	Remember Ducktales? That rich duck had that room in his house where he kept all the<strong> wealth</strong>! He had so much in that house you could even swim in it!	In ancient Japan, a RICE FIELD is a unit of<strong> wealth</strong> as it can produce enough to feed all the MOUTHs in ONE HOUSE.	A HOUSE with only ONE MOUTH and a RICE FIELD has a lot of<strong> WEALTH</strong>.	The family kept all the<strong> wealth</strong> under one <em>roof</em>.	<strong>Wealth</strong> can be assessed only when it's under the <em>roof</em>.		
貯		savings	To avoid confusing this frame with the last one, try to think of <b>savings</b> as actual money. The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but <i>shells</i>, a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The <i>nail</i> under the roof of the <i>house</i> points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's <i>shells</i> for safekeeping.		12	206	194	9	チョ	た.める、たくわ.える	It takes a lot more than one <em>clam</em> of<strong> savings</strong> to buy a <em>house</em> on a <em>street</em>.	My<strong> SAVINGS</strong> plan - I <em>nail</em> my <em>money</em>bags up in the rafters below my <em>roof</em>. I'm very secretive about it, and I wear a disguise with a big <strong>mustache</strong> (another meaning of this kanji) while I stash my loot.	<strong>savings</strong> = <em>money</em> kept under the <em>roof</em> rather than spent on the <em>street</em>.	<strong>Savings</strong> are the <em>clams</em> you have <em>nailed</em> down under your <em>roof</em>.	A slightly smarter guy has all of his <strong>SAVINGS</strong> - in the form of <strong>shells</strong> - <strong>nailed up</strong> just under the eaves of the <strong>floating roof</strong>.		
木		tree	Here we see a pictograph of a <b>tree</b>, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for <i>water</i> (Frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.	* As a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean <i>tree</i> or <i>wood</i>. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk, we shall change its meaning to <i>pole</i>, or <i>wooden pole</i>.	4	207	195	10	ボク、モク	き、こ-	If you need a story for a<strong> tree</strong>, then you need to be hit by one.	Pictograph of a<strong> tree</strong>.	As a primitive, I often use Tolkein's Ents as they have more scope for adventure than ordinary inanimate<strong> tree</strong>s.	"<em><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaRBrHxNcFA"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaRBrHxNcFA</a></em> watch it!"	[Cheat] Remember these as a set: The<strong> tree</strong> ( 木 ) is not yet ( 末 ) vermilion ( 朱 ).		
林		grove	Learn this frame in connection with the next one. A <b>grove</b> is a small cluster of <i>trees</i>. Hence the simple reduplication of the kanji for <i>tree</i> gives us the <b>grove</b>.		8	208	196	10	リン	はやし	A<strong> grove</strong> has at least two TREEs.	If you need a mnemonic to remember this then you had better give up now!	"[ <strong>grove</strong> = <em>tree</em> + <em>tree</em> ] - a <strong>grove</strong> is between a single <a href=""../v4/195.html"">tree</a> (#195 木) and a many-treed <a href=""../v4/197.html"">forest</a> (#197 森)."	Two <em>trees</em> together make up a<strong> GROVE</strong>.	"""I must…safe guard the<strong> GROVE</strong>"" says the Keeper of the<strong> Grove</strong> as he uses his treant ability to cast TWO TREE minions. (warcraft III reference)."		
森		forest	"A <b>forest</b> is a large expanse of <i>trees</i>, or ""<i>trees</i>, <i>trees</i> everywhere,"" to adopt the expression we used back in frames 22 and 23."		12	209	197	10	シン	もり	The higher you go up a mountain the less trees there are, that's so u dont mess up with their possition like i do.	Another <em>tree</em> planted within a <em>grove</em> turns it into a<strong> FOREST</strong>.	Many Trees make a<strong> forest</strong>.	A triangle of <em>trees</em> is all that's needed to depict a<strong> forest</strong>.	A triforce of trees makes a<strong> forest</strong>.		
桂		Japanese Judas-tree	Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what a <b>Japanese Judas-tree</b> looks like, and probably never even heard of it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make remembering it easy. Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a <i>tree</i> with <i>ivy</i> growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman's rope.		10	210	198	10	ケイ	かつら	"Simple mnemonic : ""The<strong> Japanese Judas-tree</strong> is the <em>tree</em> on which Judas hang himself to the <em>ivy</em>"" (Judas the traitor of the Christian bible). Just picture Judas hanging himself, using <em>ivy</em> as a if it was a rope."	A <em>tree</em> covered in poison <em>ivy</em> will quickly betray you, thus the name<strong> JAPANESE JUDAS-TREE</strong>.	"The <strong>Katsura</strong> (<strong>Japanese Judas-tree</strong>) is a thin <em>tree</em> (sort of like the stretched out 木 used in this kanji) with little green (the color of an emerald, a <em>jewel</em>) leaves. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsura_"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsura_</a>(tree)."	Japanese JEWEL TREE sounds like JUDAS-tree.	Interesting… this tree is called a かつら (Katura) Tree in Japan. It got the<strong> Japanese Judas-Tree</strong> distinction because it bears a similar leaf-type to the Judas Tree found in Europe and such. For fun word-play with both the Judas &amp; Katsura distinctions… it might be good to learn that a homonym for Katsura (w/different Kanji 鬘) is a hairpiece or wig! So now imagine some dishevled business man with a funny hairpiece stringing ivy around the Katsura/Judas tree to hang himself with!!		
柏		oak	"This kanji calls to mind the famous myth of the ""golden bough."" As you may recall, what made the sacred <b>oak</b> in the forest of Diana the Huntress outside of Rome ""golden"" were the <i>white</i> berries of the mistletoe that grew in the branches of the tree. When the light of the sun shone through them, they turned yellow and the branch to which they clung appeared to be made of gold. (If you don't know the story, take a break today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth and fable. Even if you forget the kanji - which of course you won't - the story of the mistletoe and the fate it brought to Balder the Beautiful is most memorable.)"		9	211	199	10	ハク、ヒャク、ビャク	かしわ	The wood from<strong> oak</strong> <em>trees</em> can be used to make barrels in which <em>white</em> wine is aged. What's more, I love <em>white</em> wine with an <strong>oaky</strong> flavour…	An<strong> oak</strong> <em>tree</em> is <em>white</em>, from left to right!	"[Pokemon] Ash :: ""Going to <strong>Oak</strong> for my first Pokemon!"" Mom :: ""<strong>Oak</strong>, <strong>Oak</strong>? That <em>tree</em>?"" Ash :: ""Noo! Professor <strong>Oak</strong>! You know, he always wears a <em>white</em> coat!"" Mom :: ""Okay dear! Don't forget clean underwear!""."	The white tree of Minas Tirith was an<strong> oak</strong>!	Prof.<strong> Oak</strong> ( オオキド博士 to Japanese fans) is named after a tree and has white hair.		
枠		frame	You might think of the <b>frame</b> this character refers to as the sort of <b>frame</b> we have created by drawing a dark line around this kanji and its explanation. Then think of that line as made of very thin <i>wood</i>; and finally note how each time the line bends it forms a 90° angle, thus giving us the <i>nine</i> and the <i>ten</i>.		8	212	200	10		わく	<strong>wood</strong> at <strong>90 (9 * 10)</strong> degrees.	Nine out of ten picture<strong> frame</strong>s are made out of wood. The rest are made of metal or plastic.	A good <em>wood</em>en <strong>frame</strong> has perfect right angles at each corner: <em>ninety</em> degrees at each one. 枠 (わく) :<strong> frame</strong>, slide.	<strong>Nine-tenths</strong> of all<strong> frame</strong>s are made of <strong>wood</strong> (9 over 10).	Wooden<strong> frame</strong> 9x10.		
梢		treetops	As the days grow shorter and shorter, or so the northern European myth goes, the fear grows that the sun will take its leave of us altogether, abandoning the world to total darkness. Fixing <i>candles</i> to the branches of evergreen <i>trees</i>, it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs. The story is a lot longer and more complex than that, but it should help to fix the image of climbing high up into the <b>treetops</b> to fix <i>candles</i> on the <i>tree</i>.		11	213	201	10	ショウ	こずえ、くすのき	At Christmas time, on the<strong> treetops</strong>, people used to place great big <em>candles</em> (Now we usually place a star instead).	If you cut off the<strong> treetops</strong>, they still <em>resemble</em> the <em>trees</em> they used to be part of.<strong> Treetops</strong>=<em>tree</em> <em>resemblance</em>.	A gigantic <em>candle</em> is standing to the right of the <em>tree</em>, the flame rising higher than the<strong> treetops</strong>.	"Doesn't really mean<strong> treetops</strong>. It means the end of a branch. In English, the name for each year's new growth at the end of every branch is a ""candle"". Same in Japanese."	The tops of the trees, as in the fractal theory, resembles a whole tree if you look from afar.		
棚		shelf	"One often thinks of books as ""good <i>companions</i>,"" but here it is the <b>shelf</b> we store them on that is the <i>companion</i>. The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, <i>wood</i>, and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story."		12	214	202	10	ホウ	たな、-だな	A<strong> shelf</strong> is a <em>wooden companion</em> to books.	I think of an Otaku, with a <em>wooden</em><strong> shelf</strong> full of anime action figure statures, who are sadly his only <em>companions</em>.	My ideal <em>companion</em> would have an ass I could use as a<strong> shelf</strong>. Just look at those two <em>flesh</em>y hemispheres. The association of <em>wood</em> should come easily.	A<strong> shelf</strong> is made out of <em>wood</em>, and it is a <em>companion</em> to books. But most importantly for me, the <em>two moons</em> look like the spines of hardbound books standing next to one another as <em>companions</em> on a<strong> shelf</strong>.	A <em>wooden</em> <strong>shelf</strong> is the perfect <em>companion</em> to all my lovely books!		
杏		apricot	Since <b>apricots</b> can be eaten just as they fall from the <i>trees</i>, picture this <i>mouth</i> agape at the bottom of a <i>tree</i> (just as the elements have it), waiting for <b>apricots</b> to fall into it.		7	215	203	10	キョウ、アン、コウ	あんず	From the <em>tree</em> straight into the <em>mouth</em> is the best way to eat an<strong> APRICOT</strong>!	Imagine Totoro sleeping under his <em>tree</em>. As he snores a giant<strong> apricot</strong> falls nicely into his open <em>mouth</em> and he emits a giant burp of satisfaction. I can hear that music alreay….to - to to - to - ro…	If you eat<strong> apricot</strong>s too fast, you'll end up eating the pits too. And we all know what happens then - an<strong> apricot</strong> tree will grow out of your mouth.	The<strong> apricot</strong> fell from the TREE into my MOUTH.	I lay under the<strong> apricot</strong> <em>tree</em> and let the delicious<strong> apricot</strong>s drop into my <em>mouth</em>.		
桐		paulownia	"Since you probably don't know what a <b>paulownia</b> <i>tree</i> is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase ""the Little Brothers of St. <b>Paulownia.</b>"" It is a short step to associate the <i>tree</i> with the <i>monks</i> to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental <i>tree</i> really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.)"		10	216	204	10	トウ、ドウ	きり	"In Japan, a<strong> paulownia</strong> (きり）is known as the ""princess tree"". It was once a traditional TREE planted at the SAME time as the birth of a daughter. It would grow fast enough that, at the time of her wedding, it could be used to make a dresser as a wedding present for her."	<strong>Paulownia</strong> is a Japanese tree which looks same as any other tree.	"In the forest, there's a tree that my goofy friend PAUL claims he OWNS. I think he's nuts, because the tree looks the SAME as all the others.In Japan, a<strong> paulownia</strong> (きり）is known as the ""princess tree""."	Also called Phoenix tree. After the wood is harvested the tree regenerates from its roots. The same tree comes up again.	"Paul owns the <em>same</em> <em>tree</em> as everyone else, a<strong> paulownia</strong>. // not every tree as in <a href=""../v4/460.html"">plum</a> (#460 梅)."		
植		plant	You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to <b>plant</b> a young <i>tree</i> and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up <i>straight</i>.		12	217	205	10	ショク	う.える、う.わる	<strong>Plant</strong>s don't become <em>tree</em>s <em>straightaway</em>.	When you<strong> plant</strong><strong> plant</strong>s, you use a piece of WOOD to make the<strong> plant</strong> grow STRAIGHT.	If you get a new tree it is of course best to go<strong> plant</strong> it straightaway. Without<strong> plant</strong>ing it straightaway the roots won't have enough time to be healthy and strong like the tree needs.	<strong>PLANT</strong> a TREE with tottoro and it might start growing STRAIGHTAWAY. (see tonari no tottoro :D).	To<strong> plant</strong>: act of putting that small <em>tree</em> <em>straight</em> into the ground.		
椅		chair	Instead of making a <b>chair</b> out of wood from a <i>tree</i>, this kanji has us making the whole <i>tree</i> into a <b>chair</b>, which looks most <i>strange</i> sitting in your living room where the sofa used to be.		12	218	2480	10	イ		To the Japanese, the first time they saw a<strong> chair</strong>, it looked like a <em>strange</em> use of <em>wood</em>! Probably why they still like to sit on the floor…	"<a href=""Http://www.pooktre.com/"">Http://www.pooktre.com/</a>."	A <em>strange</em> kind of <em>tree</em> grows in the shape of a<strong> chair</strong>.	Traditionally a <em>wooden</em><strong> chair</strong> would have been a <em>strange</em> object in a Japanese home.	<em>Wooden</em> rocking<strong> chair</strong>s must've seemed pretty <em>strange</em> to those seeing them for the first time.		
枯		wither	What makes a <i>tree</i> begin to <b>wither</b> up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple <i>old age</i>, as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled <i>old tree</i>, <b>withering</b> away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over.		9	219	206	10	コ	か.れる、か.らす	A tree<strong> wither</strong>s away as it gets old.	When flowers get old they <em>suffer</em> (frame 225), but <em>old trees</em> just<strong> WITHER</strong> away painlessly. (Picture flowers crying in pain, but a dried up tree silent and sad).	The <em>tree</em> is <em>old</em> and <strong>withered</strong>.	I had trouble remembering this one using tree and old, so I just thought of what the <em>wood</em> of an <em>old</em> man would look like, and that did the trick.	When flowers get old they are said to be <em>suffering</em> (225) but there is no sympathy for the poor <em>old tree</em> which simply<strong> wither</strong>s!		
朴		crude	As all magicians who have passed their apprenticeship know, one makes one's <i>wand</i> out of a hazel branch and is careful not to alter the natural form of the <i>wood</i>. For the magic of the <i>wand</i> derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its <b>crude</b>, natural state.		6	220	207	10	ボク	ほう、ほお、えのき	<em>Wooden wands</em> are the <strong>crudest</strong>. They are nothng compared to their carbon fibre equivilents.	A beginner magician starts with a<strong> crude</strong> <em>wooden magic wand</em>. Later he'll upgrade to magicite, of course.	You can make a<strong> crude</strong> magic wand from any tree.	First year boys at Hogwarts tend to compare their <em>wood</em> to their <em>wand</em>, but this is considered<strong> crude</strong> behavior.	This guy is so<strong> crude</strong> he doesn't face the tree when he relieves himself.		
村		village	The character for <i>town</i> was associated with <i>rice fields</i> (Frame 96). That for <b>village</b>, a step lower on the evolutionary path to cities, shows a circle of <i>trees glued together</i> to measure off the confines of a <b>village</b>.		7	221	208	10	ソン	むら	If you've ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you'll remember that every <em>town</em> was all bordered off by a line of <em>trees</em> with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were <em>glued together</em> so you could only exit<strong> town</strong> through the main or side gates, (so you couldn't escape the important scripted scenes.).	Pfft. At it's core, a<strong> town</strong> is just a bunch of <em>wood</em> <em>glued</em> together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.	There is a mix up, this kanji means むら=village, not<strong> town</strong>. The one for<strong> town</strong> is まち　= 町 . 100% shure because my teacher is native Japanese.	"I swap the <em>town/village</em> keywords. See also <a href=""../v4/92.html"">village</a> (#92 町). As the old Siberian joke went, there's nothing to do in a small rural <strong>village</strong> but count (<em>measure</em>) the <em>trees</em>."	"村 means village! See <a href=""../v4/92.html"">village</a> (#92 町). Please don't get them confused like Heisig seems to have done. Story: See the <em>tree</em>s surround the little <strong>village</strong> so densely it looks like they are <em>glued</em> together. Imagine a little village on a hillside surrounded by trees with glue dripping off the trees."		
相		inter-	The prefix <b>inter-</b> stirs up associations of cooperation among people. From there we read off the elements: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>eye</i>. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one's own <i>eye</i> before helping your neighbors with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for <b>inter-</b>human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji!		9	222	209	10	ソウ、ショウ	あい-	The prime minister is having<strong> inter-</strong>course behind that <em>tree</em>! All you can see are his <em>eyes</em> poking out from the righthand-side of the <em>tree</em>.	"ソウ/ショウ/あ INTER /MUTUAL /ASPECT /PHASE /MINISTER. ""Long ago, before there were telephones, people living far from one another would climb <em>trees</em> to <em>eye</em> each other's aspects and<strong> inter-</strong>act for their mutual benefit. Those who did this best became government <em>ministers</em>, with the top person (perhaps the one with the longest neck ( 首 , <a href=""../v4/70.html"">neck</a> (#70 首)) becoming the prime <em>minister</em> <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%8C%E9%A6%96%E7%9B%B8"">「首相</a> (しゅしょう)""."	I changed my story to remind myself there are other primary meanings for this character: The Minister of <em>Trees</em> has a good <em>eye</em> for<strong> inter-</strong>action.	"A piece of wood went ""inter"" my eye. This is an internal injury."	<strong>Inter</strong>course usually occurs between two people lying beneath a <em>tree</em>, gazing into each other's <em>eyes</em>.		
机		desk	We need to fix imagination here on two things to learn the kanji for <b>desk</b>: the wonderful rough <i>wood</i> of which it has been hewn and the <i>wind</i> that blows across it, sending your papers flying all over the room. These two elements, written in that order, dictate how to write the character.		6	223	210	10	キ	つくえ	My <em>wooden</em><strong> desk</strong> is so messy, it looks like a strong <em>wind</em> blew my things all over it.	Whenever I'm alone at my computer<strong> desk</strong>, I'm always getting <em>wood</em> and breaking <em>wind</em>.	The tree was blown down by the wind - so I made a<strong> desk</strong> from it.	Studying at my <em>wooden</em><strong> desk</strong>, a great <em>wind</em> sweeps away all my papers - there goes all my hard work - I can see all the kanji disappearing into the sky.	A <em>tree</em> blown over in the <em>wind</em> makes a<strong> desk</strong>.		
本		book	"Recalling that <b>books</b> are made of paper, and paper made of <i>trees</i>, one might think of a <b>book</b> as a slice of a <i>tree</i>. Can you seethe ""cross-cut"" in the trunk of the <i>tree</i>? Picture it as a chainsaw cutting you out a few <b>books</b> with which to start your own private library."		5	224	211	10	ホン	もと	The origin of a<strong> book</strong> is paper made out of TREEs. ONE tree can make many<strong> book</strong>s.	A<strong> book</strong> is <em>one</em> slice of a <em>tree</em>.	An axe cutting a tree to make<strong> book</strong>s.	<strong>Book</strong>s are the root of all knowledge (in Chinese this character means root or basis).	Sad 'Fact': You have to <em>cut</em> down <em>ten</em> oriental <em>tree</em>s just to produce one<strong> book</strong>!		
札		tag	The <b>tags</b> you see hanging on <i>trees</i> in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of <i>trees</i> they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the <b>tag</b> to the branch as a large <i>fishhook</i>. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again.		5	225	212	10	サツ	ふだ	Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing<strong> tag</strong>s on them.	"Might be good to note that this is also the Kanji for ""Paper Money"" w/ the reading さつ ( <a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%8D%83%E5%86%86%E6%9C%AD%EF%BC%9D"">千円札＝</a> 1000 Yen paper bill)… It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 (""trump"" playing cards). For the<strong> tag</strong> meaning I like to think of wooden<strong> tag</strong>s hung on hooks from trees… but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to ""hook you in"" so to speak."	In order to put a<strong> tag</strong> on a <em>tree</em> you need a <em>hook</em>.	A <strong>tag</strong> was <em>hook</em>ed on a <em>tree</em>. Since the<strong> tag</strong> was actually a banknote (さつ), it's no wonder that it's gone now and only the <em>hook</em> remains sticking out from a <em>tree</em>.	A little piece of paper (wood) attached by a hook makes a<strong> TAG</strong>.		
暦		calendar	Look at this character in reverse order, from bottom up. First we see the primitive for <i>days</i>, an appropriate enough way to begin a <b>calendar</b>. Next we see a <i>grove of trees</i> growing under a <i>cliff</i>. The laws of nature being what they are, the <i>trees</i> would be stunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enough to keep growing upwards until they passed through the layers of rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that in those little boxes marking off the <i>days</i> on your wall <b>calendar</b>, you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or so time-lapse pictures of that <i>grove of trees</i> each month, from January under the <i>cliff</i> to December on top of the <i>cliff</i>. The story is not as complex as it sounds, particularly if you happen to have a <b>calendar</b> nearby and can flip through it with this image in mind.		14	226	213	10	レキ	こよみ、りゃく	Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a <em>cliff</em> to form or erode. A <em>tree</em> takes many months to grow. But <em>days</em> pass by regularly - so in this way, we see the movement of time such as with a<strong> CALENDAR</strong>.	This is just a picture of a wall<strong> calendar</strong> with a page for each month. The bottom half has the grid of days, the top half has a pretty picture of a forest this month. The cliff radical here is the top and left edges of the paper. You can see the paper curling up at the lower left where a breeze is trying to turn the page.	You can use a<strong> calendar</strong> to count the number of DAYs it takes to grow two TREES under a CLIFF.	<strong>Calendar; almanac.</strong> A<strong> calendar</strong> measures time in years, months and days. A <em>cliff</em> (厂) takes years to form; a <em>grove</em> ( 木木 ) of trees takes months to grow; but the <em>sun</em> ( 日 ) rises and falls every day. All of these periods can be recorded in a<strong> calendar</strong>.	I love those nature<strong> CALENDAR</strong>s with all the photos of <em>cliffs</em> and <em>trees</em> and the setting <em>sun</em>.		
案		plan	"Without much effort, the elements <i>relax</i> . . . <i>tree</i> suggest a hammock strung between two <i>trees</i> in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, <b>planning</b> something or other. After all, it's something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best <b>plan</b> of action to take. Be sure to relate the <i>relaxation</i> to the <i>tree</i>, so that you don't end up with something else in its place (like ""legs"" or ""desk"" or ""table"")."		10	227	214	10	アン	つくえ	I<strong> plan</strong> to RELAX on top of that TREE.	If you bring a woman to your house, generally its not a good<strong> plan</strong> to stick your wood up her bottom, she may scream in pain あん!	Man's<strong> plan</strong> of life: build a house, find a woman,<strong> plan</strong>t a tree.	"Calvin and Hobbes sit in their <em>treehouse</em>, which has a big ""no <em>girls</em>"" sign on it, deviously making their<strong> PLAN</strong> for their next water-balloon attack against the 'stinky girls'."	How can you relax when you have a tree jammed up your ass?! Quickly make a<strong> plan</strong> to get down from there!		
燥		parch	"<b>Parch</b>ment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial <b>parch</b>ment from <i>wood</i> pulp. The <i>fire</i> at the left and in the ""strong"" position serves to remind us of the root word, ""<b>parch</b>,"" since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like <i>fire</i>. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a ""<i>wood-good</i>,""), wet it, and hold it over a <i>hearth</i> in your mind's eye. Now watch as it <b>parches</b> the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling <b>parch</b>ment."		17	228	215	10	ソウ	はしゃ.ぐ	"Tip: <em>goods</em> + <em>wood/tree</em> : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it's worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest ""<em>furniture</em>"" (a common type of <em>wooden goods</em>). REF: <em>parch</em> (FRAME 215) , <a href=""../v4/671.html"">maneuver</a> (#671 操), <a href=""../v4/1369.html"">winding</a> (#1369 繰), <a href=""../v4/2035.html"">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻). Story: It's been so<strong> parch</strong>ed recently that your <em>furniture</em> suddenly catches <em>fire</em>."	The<strong> parch</strong>ment says you need <em>fire</em> to make <em>good</em>s from <em>tree</em>s.	When a FIRE is<strong> parch</strong>ed, it isn't thirsty for water, it wants to gobble up some WOODEN GOODIES!	"ソウ ""A <em>fire's</em> heat will<strong> parch</strong>/dry out any <em>goods</em> made from <em>wood</em>."" E.G. 乾燥する （かんそう・する）to dry up."	"Hint: Actually the element - 喿 - is itself a rare kanji, that has the meaning of ""chirping of birds"" (see these little mouthes on the tree). On - ソウ/ ショウ Kun さわ.ぐ/ かしま.しい/すき."		
未		not yet	As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a <i>tree</i> that is <b>not yet</b> fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the <i>tree</i> has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the <i>tree</i>.		5	229	216	10	ミ、ビ	いま.だ、ま.だ、ひつじ	I believe a better version of that by mameha1977: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) does<strong> not yet</strong> ( 未 ) have exremities ( 末 ) of vermilion ( 朱 ).	[Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) is<strong> not yet</strong> ( 末 ) vermilion ( 朱 ).	This TREE is<strong> not yet</strong> fully grown: it's only ONE year old.	"""Have you sawed off those two smaller branches at the top of the tree?"" ""Not yet…""."	The top branch of the tree is<strong> not yet</strong> as long as the bottom one.		
末		extremity	This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the <b>extremity</b> of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later.		9	230	217	10	マツ、バツ	すえ	The tree has reached the<strong> extremity</strong> of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.	There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let's try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his<strong> extremity</strong> into a small hole in a <em>tree</em>.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the<strong> extremity</strong>? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I'd prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ;).	The <strong>tree's</strong> top branches have grown to <strong>extremities</strong>.	Another version of that by mameha1977 and dat5h: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The <em>tree</em> ( 木 ) has <em>not yet</em> ( 未 ) reached the<strong> extremity</strong> ( 末 ) of its <em>vermilion</em> ( 朱 ) foliage.	It's near the upper<strong> extremity</strong> of the tree that grows the larger branches.		
昧		obscure	The most <b>obscure</b> ideas are those that the <i>sun</i> of reason has <i>not yet</i> dawned on. Be sure to give the <i>sun</i> a professorial demeanor, complete with spectacles and a pipe.		5	231	2445	10	マイ、バイ	くら.い、むさぼ.る	Something that is<strong> obscure</strong> has <em>not yet</em> been brought before the light of <em>day</em>.	'Can't you go outside and get some <em>sun</em>?' '<em>Not yet</em>, I have to learn all these <strong>obscure</strong> RTK3 kanji!'.	Things look<strong> obscure</strong> when the <em>sun</em> is <em>not yet</em> out.	"Unlike us, some people finish RTK 1 and think ""Should I learn all those<strong> obscure</strong> kanji in RTK 3? Nah, NOT YET. I'll learn them some other DAY."" We're just extra Kanji sadistic. (Although, I should say, this kanji is not very<strong> obscure</strong>. 曖昧 is in the vocab list for JLPT level 2)."	An<strong> obscure</strong> artist or personage is one whose <em>day in the sun</em> has <em>not yet</em> come.		
沫		splash	The <b>splash</b> this kanji refers to is the dash of <i>water</i> against the rocks, with all the foam and spray that this creates. If you think of a <b>splash</b> in this sense as a wave that has run its full course and reached its <i>extremity</i>, namely the seashore, and if you think of it pictorially in your mind's eye, this somewhat rare (but oh so-easy-to-learn) kanji is yours for good.		8	232	218	10	マツ、バツ	あわ、しぶき、つばき	The <em>extremity</em> of a wave of <em>water</em> is the<strong> splash</strong>.	A<strong> splash</strong> is WATER that has reached its EXTREMITY.	Timber! …the <em>extremity</em> of the tree fell into the <em>water</em> the nearby lake. What a<strong> splash</strong>!!	<strong>SPLASH</strong> = <em>water</em> being scattered to the <em>extreme</em> 泡沫 = うたかた, ほうまつ = bubble on surface of liquid; transient o マツ o バツ k あわ k しぶき k つばき.	Imagine the <em>extremity</em> of a<strong> splash</strong> attack from a magikarp.		
味		flavor	When a tree has <i>not yet</i> finished growing, it produces fruit with a full <b>flavor</b>. When the official taster (the professional <i>mouth</i> to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently <i>not yet</i> grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy to way see the sense of <b>flavor</b> hidden in this character.		8	233	219	10	ミ	あじ、あじ.わう	My <em>mouth</em> has <em>not yet</em> swallowed the food because the<strong> flavor</strong> is so delicious that I keep chewing it.	To enjoy a food's<strong> FLAVOR</strong>, it must be in one's MOUTH but NOT YET swallowed.	"""Not in my <em>mouth</em>!"" she cried. ""<em>Not yet</em>! You know how much I hate the<strong> flavor</strong>!"" (I know, the story is silly… but it works!)."	My <em>mouth</em> is <em>not yet</em> ready to taste the<strong> flavor</strong> of a tree.	My <em>mouth</em> has <em>not yet</em> experienced such<strong> FLAVOR</strong>.		
妹		younger sister	The <b>younger sister</b> in the family is the <i>woman</i> in the family who, like the newest branch in a tree, is <i>not yet</i> old enough or mature enough to do everything the elder sister can do (See frame 442).		8	234	220	10	マイ	いもうと	My<strong> younger sister</strong> is NOT YET a fully grown WOMAN.	Is your<strong> younger sister</strong> a woman? Not yet! Damn!	My<strong> YOUNGER SISTER</strong> is a <em>woman</em> who will always be <em>not yet</em> my age.	My<strong> younger sister</strong> is a <em>woman</em> who is <em>not yet</em> fully grown.	My<strong> younger sister</strong> is not a girl, but NOT YET a woman (Brittany Spears).		
朱		vermilion	That red-orange color we call <b>vermilion</b> is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the <i>drop</i> hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has <i>not yet</i> fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, <b>vermilion</b> is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.)		6	235	221	10	シュ	あけ	It's autumn: only one<strong> vermilion</strong> leaf on the tree has <em>not yet</em> fallen.	[Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) is not yet ( 未 )[correction wrong character before]<strong> vermilion</strong> ( 朱 ).	<strong>VERMILION</strong> is the color of the last leaves on the TREE which have NOT YET fallen in autumn.	[Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) is not yet ( 未 )<strong> vermilion</strong> ( 朱 ). (thanks solarmist) in late summer there's a <em>drop</em> of color on the <em>trees</em> but it's <em>not yet</em><strong> vermilion</strong>.	[Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) is not yet ( 末 )<strong> vermilion</strong> ( 朱 ).		
株		stocks	"The <b>stocks</b> bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy <i>tree</i>, in which one takes ""<b>stock</b>"" in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more <i>trees</i> like itself. Usually good <b>stocks</b> are referred to as ""blue chip,"" but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color <i>vermilion</i>, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves."		10	236	222	10	シュ	かぶ	Which <em>tree</em> would you buy<strong> stocks</strong> in - the healthy one on the left, or the one with only one <em>vermilion</em> leaf left on the right?	"Ideally, one buys<strong> stocks</strong> when a company is young, ""green,"" and rapidly growing – then sells them just before the last vermillion leaf falls off, and a period of dormancy or limited growth begins."	"I have a hot tip for you. Buy<strong> stocks</strong> in a company called ""Tree and Vermillion Ltd""."	"Don't think of the <strong>stock</strong>-market. Instead imagine the <em>wood</em>en medieval<strong> stocks</strong> used to hold a prisoner's head and hands between two blocks of <em>wood</em>. The <em>wood</em> in this case is <em>vermilion</em> coloured, as it often was. Imagine <strong>SHOO</strong>ING away the guards and blowing the<strong> stocks</strong> open with a big ""<strong>kaboo</strong>m"" sound. (ON reading SHU, Kun reading kabu)."	You buy<strong> stocks</strong> when they're new and green like a <em>normal tree</em> and sell it when it's <em>vermillion-HOT</em> and pricy.		
若		young	Here we see a <i>flower</i> held in the <i>right</i> hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where <i>flowers</i> picked with the <i>right</i> hand grant eternal <b>youth</b>; and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens.		8	237	223	10	ジャク、ニャク、ニャ	わか.い、わか-、も.しくわ、も.し、も.しくは	The<strong> young</strong> little girl held a cute flower in her right hand.	<strong>Young</strong> love puts a <em>flower</em> in her <em>right</em> hand (true love puts a ring on her left!!).	Imagine Alice reading a note in Wonderland: 'The <em>flowers</em> on the <em>right</em> will make you <strong>younger</strong>. Those on the left will make you older.'.	<strong>Young</strong> people are always right.	Ah,<strong> young</strong> love! A man holding FLOWERs (well, better than GRASS) in his RIGHT hand.		
草		grass	Perhaps you know the custom of seeding <b>grass</b> randomly or in some particular pattern with the <i>flower</i> called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in <i>early</i> spring. As the <b>grass</b> begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny <i>flowers</i> dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of <b>grass</b> somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in <i>flowers</i> once as a sort of <i>early</i> harbinger of spring.		9	238	224	10	ソウ	くさ、くさ-、-ぐさ	<strong>Grass</strong> grows in <em>earlier</em> than <em>flowers</em>.	This<strong> grass</strong> is very long. The only <em>flowers</em> you can see are <em>sunflowers</em> – the rest are hidden by the<strong> grass</strong>.	My Dad always made me cut the<strong> grass</strong> <em>early</em> in the morning - it sucked.	<strong>Grass</strong> grows <em>early</em>, before the <em>flowers</em> which eventually grow above.	"My Dad said ""Cut the<strong> grass</strong> <em>early</em>, and watch out for the <em>FLOWERS</em>!!!"". ソウ <a href=""midori://search?text=%E8%8D%89%E5%B1%A5%E3%80%82%E3%81%8F%E3%81%95"">草履。くさ</a> ."		
苦		suffering	The picture of <b>suffering</b> we are given here is that of a <i>flower</i> that has grown <i>old</i>. When a <i>flower</i> ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even <b>suffers</b>. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better.		8	239	225	10	ク	くる.しい、-ぐる.しい、くる.しむ、くる.しめる、にが.い、にが.る	Flowers for the old man<strong> suffering</strong> in the hospital.	The derivates from opium <em>poppies</em> such as morphine can be used to tame the<strong> suffering</strong> of the <em>old</em>.	Old people smoke pot to ease their<strong> suffering</strong>.	FLOWERS <strong>SUFFER</strong> when they grow OLD. Trees slowly wither( 枯 ) and die. I find I can remember these together.	If someone dies you suffer. You then put a <em>flower</em> on the <em>gravestone</em>.		
苛		bullying	A nosegay of <i>flowers</i> make a nice gift, but if those flowers are poison oak, they <i>can</i> amount to <b>bullying</b>. Be sure to emphasize the word <i>can</i> when you repeat this little phrase to yourself.		8	240	2373	10	カ	いじ.める、さいな.む、いらだ.つ、からい、こまかい	"""How many <em>flowers</em> <em>can</em> I stuff in your nostrils? Well I'm just gonna have to go and see.""<strong> Bullying</strong> at its worst!"	"The <em>Little Engine that Could</em>, drawing from his own experiences, has become a spokesman against<strong> bullying</strong>. He visits schools with the slogan ""Bullying CAN be stopped,"" and hands out <em>flowers</em> of peace and understanding."	"苛める （いじめる） ""If you don't give me those <em>flowers</em>, I'll drive this <em>spike</em> into your <em>mouth</em>.""."	<em>Flowers</em>, you ask if they <em>can</em> feel <em>pain</em>, do you? ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^ They sure <em>-can-</em>!! ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^!!	"""With <em>flowers</em>, I think I <em>can</em> stop the<strong> bullying</strong>,"" said the Little Engine that Could. Indeed the<strong> bullying</strong> stopped, as the tormentors were covered by a trainload of flowers."		
寛		tolerant	"The <i>house</i> of <i>flowers</i> or ""hothouse"" has become a metaphor for a narrow-minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. <b>Tolerance</b>, in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage <b>tolerance</b> in those who lack it is first to have them <i>see</i> through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji."		13	241	226	10	カン	くつろ.ぐ、ひろ.い、ゆる.やか	A<strong> tolerant</strong> person will ignore SEEing GRASS (marijuana) in the HOUSE of a friend.	"To be<strong> tolerant</strong> is to see flowers (meaning ""beautiful things"") in every house, instead of looking for drawbacks."	Kanji Zen: <em>See</em> the <em>flowers</em> in the <em>house</em>. <em>See</em> the good in people. Be<strong> TOLERANT</strong>.	My wife grows flowers in the house and I see them every day. I don't really like them, but I have to be<strong> tolerant</strong>.	Into my <em>house</em> someone brought a monstrous <em>flower</em> with a big, <em>walking eye</em>, <em>see</em>ing everything, like a spy. But I am trying to be<strong> tolerant</strong>, although it is getting on my nerves. Remember: The <em>flower</em> is IN the <em>house</em> (that is, underneath its roof-sign).		
薄		dilute	"Take a good look at this kanji: the ""strong"" element here is really the <i>flower</i>, not the <i>water</i> as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the <i>acupuncturist</i> from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote <b>diluting</b> the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our <i>acupuncturist</i> performing his task with <i>flowers</i> in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe <i>water</i> into the body of the patient."		16	242	227	10	ハク	うす.い、うす-、-うす、うす.める、うす.まる、うす.らぐ、うす.ら-、うす.れる、すすき	A <em>Dr.</em> missing his needle can only use<strong> dilute</strong> <em>flower water</em> for medicine.	"[As suggested by stehr and on the forum (<a href=""http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079"">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079</a>), we create a new keyword 'seaweed' for the <em>flower</em> on top and <em>water</em> below and to the left. See also <a href=""../v4/299.html"">fall</a> (#299 落), <a href=""../v4/1912.html"">clan</a> (#1912 藩),<a href=""../v4/2035.html"">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻). This story is for people using that idea.] The <em>homeopath</em> (a doctor without any needle) specialises in <strong>dilute</strong> medicines. This one's an essence of <em>seaweed</em> – just dip the seaweed into the beaker, swish it about and remove. Barmy!"	"<strong>Note</strong> This character belongs to a set of characters which share the <em>flower/water</em> primitive such as:: <a href=""../v4/227.html"">dilute</a> (#227 薄), <a href=""../v4/299.html"">fall</a> (#299 落), <a href=""../v4/1912.html"">clan</a> (#1912 藩), and <a href=""../v4/2035.html"">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻)…. ( 落 薄 藩 藻 ) It may be helpful to create a primitive keyword for this occurrence (like <em>seaweed</em> or <em>watering can</em>) which can save a lot of time distinguishing them from characters like <em>Sino</em> 満 and <em>Full</em> 満 , where the <em>water</em> primitive is larger than the <em>flower</em> primitive."	"A man with thick blood dripping out of his hands visits an <em>acupuncturist</em>. ""Please <strong>dilute</strong> my blood!"" he says. The <em>acupuncturist</em> gives the man a seat, punctures his skin with many <em>flower</em> stems, and inserts a <em>drop of</em> cold <em>water</em> through the holes at the top of those stems. The man's blood becomes soft pink in colour . As too much blood had been <strong>diluted</strong>, he dies."	A homeopathy <em>specialist</em> takes <em>flowers</em> and <em>dilutes</em> them in some <em>water</em>… (picture my hippie aunt with her homeopathist diluting flowers in water.).		
葉		leaf	"Three elements are given here: <i>flower</i> . . . <i>generation</i> . . . <i>tree</i>. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the <b>leaf</b> that feeds the <i>flowers</i> on a <i>tree</i>. The element for <i>generation</i> interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a <i>tree</i> from one <i>generation</i> to the next is like its ""turning over a new <b>leaf</b>."""		12	243	228	10	ヨウ	は	On top of the <strong>leaves</strong> a <em>flower</em> appears, promising new <em>generations</em> for the old <em>tree</em> below.	The flower generation spent far too much time up trees trying to smoke leaves.	"Tip: New primitive: Let <em>Tarzan</em> = <em>generation</em> + <em>tree</em> – because <em>Tarzan</em> lives with several <em>generation</em>s of his family at the top of a <em>tree</em>. (This combination appears five times: <em>leaf</em> (FRAME 228), <a href=""../v4/521.html"">butterfly</a> (#521 蝶), <a href=""../v4/2158.html"">chatter</a> (#2158 喋), <a href=""../v4/2726.html"">secret agent</a> (#2726 諜), <a href=""../v4/2926.html"">label</a> (#2926 牒)). Story: In the <em>flower</em> shop you see <em>Tarzan</em> trying on various <strong>leaves</strong> (which he wears to cover his private parts)."	A<strong> LEAF</strong> is like a FLOWER that lasts only one GENERATION on a TREE and then it dies.	The <em>flower</em> <em>generation</em> were<strong> leaf</strong> smoking <em>tree</em>-huggers.		
模		imitation	Ah, but haven't modern <i>graveyards</i> become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing <b>imitation</b> <i>trees</i> in the <i>graveyard</i>. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long.		14	244	229	10	モ、ボ		If I find out this furniture you're selling me is made of<strong> imitation</strong> <em>wood</em>, I'll put you in the <em>graveyard</em>.	The Japanese are so enamored of everything plastic, they even put<strong> IMITATION</strong> plastic <em>trees</em> in their <em>graveyards</em>! (No, not really, but I wouldn't be surprised).	This kanji was a real asshole. No one liked this kanji. That is why that when this kanji died, no one cared, and it received a <em>wooden</em>,<strong> imitation</strong> tombstone; not a fancy marble one, at its resting place in the <em>graveyard</em>.	The<strong> imitation</strong> <em>tree</em> looked like a <em>big sun flower</em>.	<strong>imitation</strong>: we left a wodden sculpture (an <strong>imitation</strong>) at the <em>graveyard</em> of our old dog. (<strong>graveyard</strong>: were we put <em>flowers</em> for our deceased <em>big St. Bernard</em>, good ol' <em>Sunny</em>).		
漠		vague	Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are <b>vaguely</b> discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true <i>graveyard</i>. The <i>water</i> may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock - anything that helps you associate <b>vagueness</b> with the <i>graveyard</i> and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame.		13	245	230	10	バク		The precise locations of sailors who meet a WATERY GRAVE are<strong> vague</strong>.	The water in the graveyard has worn away the headstones, so the writing is<strong> vague</strong>.	<strong>Vague</strong>,<strong> vague</strong>, watery grave. (Repeat this phrase several times).	<em>Water</em> and <em>graveyard</em> can only result in a<strong> vague</strong> mnemonic for this kanji.	The mist and fog surrounding the graveyard make things appear<strong> vague</strong> and unfamiliar.		
墓		grave	"The mounds of <i>soil</i> with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill <b>graves</b> we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the <i>soil</i> comes UNDER the <i>graveyard</i>, rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as ""lying under boot-hill"" if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji."		13	246	231	10	ボ	はか	The <em>soil</em> under a <em>graveyard</em> is full of <strong>graves</strong>.	A<strong> grave</strong> is a patch of <em>soil</em> in a <em>graveyard</em>.	<strong>Grave</strong>s are in the soil beneath the<strong> grave</strong>yard.	The <em>flower</em>s were blooming, the <em>sun</em> was shining, when I let my St. Bernard off his leash and he lifted his leg and peed ON some freshly turned <em>soil</em> that was dug out for a<strong> grave</strong>. [Thanks to dwhitman for the idea of the peeing dog because the way the last stroke for 大 is shifted rightwards would mess me up, but if the dog's got his leg up in the air… it's a nice visual image for the change from the primitive <em>graveyard</em>.).	The <em>soil</em> under the Kakariko <em>graveyard</em> is full of many more things than <strong>graves</strong>.		
暮		livelihood	Imagine that you have chosen the occupation of the keeper of a <i>graveyard</i> and spend your <i>days</i> tending to other's dead hood in order to make your means of <b>livelihood</b>.		14	247	232	10	ボ	く.れる、く.らす	He made a<strong> livelihood</strong> out of robbing GRAVEYARDS in broad DAYlight.	I like trikatu's simple way to remember this, but just in case the primitive placements confuse you, change it around to this: Before you complain about your<strong> livelihood</strong>, think about spending your days <em>under</em> a graveyard. Life is always better than death, eh?	"The gravedigger makes his<strong> LIVELIHOOD</strong> digging in the <em>graveyard</em> all <em>day</em> For graveyard, imagine an idyllic picture: beautiful grass with the sun shining down…and a dog peeing on one of the graves. Don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/1034.html"">occupation</a> (#1034 営). Hold onto the irony of making your LIVElyhood from tending dead people."	Before you complain about your<strong> livelihood</strong>, think about spending your <em>days</em> in a <em>graveyard</em>.	You have to earn a<strong> LIVELIHOOD</strong> until you go to the GRAVEYARD, when your DAYS are over, and your SUN went down…		
膜		membrane	"The <i>part of the body</i> first affected by a stroll through a haunted <i>graveyard</i> is the skin, which gets goose bumps. But we save the word ""skin"" for another kanji, and use the odd word ""<b>membrane</b>"" here. Think of being so scared through and through that the goose flesh moves from the outside in, giving you goose <b>membranes</b>."		14	248	233	10	マク		In the <em>moon</em>light of the <em>graveyard</em> I hear a zombie say, <strong>MMMMM..EMM…BRANE</strong>sssss.	The<strong> membrane</strong>s in your flesh rot when placed in the graveyard.	マク<strong> Membrane</strong>s (thin layers of connective tissue) are the <em>part of the body</em> that decompose first (i.e., before the organs, ligaments, bones, etc.) after one dies and is buried in a <em>graveyard</em>.	The<strong> membrane</strong> between the dead and the living is thinnest in a graveyard in moonlight.	<em>Flesh</em> eaten by zombies in the <em>graveyard</em> is <strong>mem~brai~ns</strong>!!!		
苗		seedling	"To avoid confusion with the image of rice seedlings to appear later, we shall take these <b>seedlings</b> out of their agricultural setting in the <i>rice fields</i> and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where ""ideas"" or ""values"" are being implanted into <i>brains</i> like <b>seedlings</b> to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into <i>flower</i> right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets."		8	249	234	10	ビョウ、ミョウ	なえ、なわ-	If you plant<strong> seedling</strong>s in a FIELD eventually they will FLOWER.	Crap! There are <em>flowers</em> in the <em>rice field</em>… Who let those <strong>seedlings</strong> get in there?!	"This is obviously a flower sprouting from a rice field, and means ""<strong>rice<strong> seedling</strong></strong>"" in Japanese. My problem is keeping this kanji distinct from 圥, which Heisig dubs the ""<strong>rice<strong> seedling</strong></strong>"" primitive (see <a href=""../v4/1513.html"">land</a> (#1513 陸) ff.). It might help to keep in mind that 圥 is a rare kanji (not used in Japanese) meaning ""mushroom,"" so I will call 圥 the ""<strong>mushroom<strong> seedling</strong></strong>""."	All the <em>flowers</em> in the <em>field</em> started as <strong>seedlings</strong>.	Pikmin have FLOWERS growing out of their<strong> seedling</strong> BRAINS.		
兆		portent	Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two sloping vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that <b>portend</b> coming evils.	* When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a <i>portent</i>. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a <i>turtle</i>.	6	250	235	11	チョウ	きざ.す、きざ.し	When your wife's <em>LEGs</em> get huge hairs on them it is surely a bad<strong> portent</strong> for things to come.	A bad<strong> portent</strong> makes the hairs on your legs stand.	"Two persons turning <em>their backs</em> is a bad <strong>sign</strong>. Hint: Don't use ""turtle"" as a primitive. You'll save a lot of troubles with following kanji if you give this primitive the meaning ""a person's back""."	The actual derivation of this Kanji is a pictograph of the cracks on a heated <em>turtle</em> shell which was used in divination. The way the cracks occur on this <em>turtle</em> are a<strong> portent</strong> of evil bad luck.	"To me it looks like a ""black angel"" or something (four wings and its human-looking legs). Maybe seeing it is a bad<strong> portent</strong>?"		
桃		peach tree	To associate the <b>peach tree</b> with the primitive for a <i>portent</i>, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the <b>Peach</b> Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant <b>peach</b>, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named <b>Peach</b> Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also <i>portended</i> great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the <i>tree</i> that is associated with a <i>portent</i> of coming evil comes to be the <b>peach tree</b>.		10	251	236	11	トウ	もも	The pits of a<strong> peach tree</strong> look like <em>turtles</em>.	King Koopa consistently captures Princess Peach. Eventually he's going to run out of castles and just set her in a tree.	"If you gave the meaning ""a person's back"" to the primitive in <a href=""../v4/235.html"">portent</a> (#235 兆), you can easily discover that a<strong> peach tree</strong> is the <em>tree</em> with <em>butt</em>-shaped fruits."	If you used the story about hairy woman´s legs for portent, then:<strong> PEACH TREE</strong> is the TREE that has HAIRY fruits.	It's a little known fact, but when the ninja turtles were young Splinter actually made them follow rigid diet. Those turtles actually ate nothing but peaches. In fact, the turtles even planted a<strong> peach tree</strong> in their hideout not only to decorate the place with a tree, but because they were eating nothing but peaches.		
眺		stare	"To give someone the ""evil <i>eye</i>"" is to <b>stare</b> at them, wishing them evil. The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being <b>stared</b> at is depicted as an <i>eye</i> that <i>portends</i> evil."		11	252	237	11	チョウ	なが.める	Sauron's One fiery eye<strong> stare</strong> at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.	People<strong> stare</strong>d, <em>eyes</em> wide, at the girl in the bathing suit - she had extremely <em>hairy legs</em>!	"You lost a <strong>staring</strong> contest with a <em>turtle</em> because you blinked your <em>eye</em> before he did. (The contest wasn't fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don't need to blink so often.) <em>Eye</em> comes first, because<strong> stare</strong> is most associated with eyes. And compare with <a href=""../v4/658.html"">challenge</a> (#658 挑) where this same obstreperous turtle <em>challenges</em> you to a finger wrestling contest. (Sibyl's story with some notes that helped me)."	"If you gave the sense ""a person's back"" to the primitive in <a href=""../v4/235.html"">portent</a> (#235 兆), you can easily discover an old-man <em>staring</em> at a good-looking girl: he doesn't apart his <em>eyes</em> from her <em>back</em>."	"Litterally this kanji reads ""<em>eye</em> of <em>portent</em>"". Imagine an old lady <strong>starring</strong> into the crystal sphere trying to <em>portend</em> the future."		
犬		dog	We know that the character for <i>large</i> takes on the meaning of the <i>St. Bernard</i> <b>dog</b> when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The <i>drop</i> added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized <b>dog</b>, which compared to the <i>St. Bernard</i> is no more than a <i>drop</i> in the kennel.	* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a <i>chihuahua</i> for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of <i>a pack of wild dogs</i>.	4	253	238	11	ケン	いぬ、いぬ-	A large<strong> dog</strong>, dripping drool.	"If we remember <a href=""../v4/107.html"">large</a> (#107 大) as a man with his arms outstretched, the <strong>drop</strong> represents man's best friend - a<strong> dog</strong>."	An average<strong> dog</strong> is made to look like a little drop next to a St Bernard.	A LARGE ST. BERNARD<strong> DOG</strong> with a DROP of saliva.	I don't know why not one single person before me has seemingly thought of this, but when I first encountered this character, it just seemed SO natural for me. It looks just exactly like a guy throwing a stick for his<strong> DOG</strong> to bring it back to him. Or am I really the only one seeing this picture?		
状		status quo	Did you ever hear of the <i>turtle</i> who fell madly in love with a <i>chihuahua</i> but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the <b>status quo</b> with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love.		7	254	239	11	ジョウ		It was <em>left</em> to the <strong>turtle</strong> to make <em>right</em> with the <strong>dog</strong> and thus maintain the <strong>status quo.</strong>.	A <em>turtle</em> mounting a <em>chihuahua</em> clearly disrupts the<strong> status quo</strong>.	After beating the hare in a race, the <em>turtle</em> is now acknowledged to be the fastest animal. But the chihuahua is challenging the<strong> status quo</strong>, demanding a new race. And look - the dog is on the right, meaning he's passed the turtle! Hope he doesn't take a nap.	"If you gave the sense ""a person's back"" to the primitive in <a href=""../v4/235.html"">portent</a> (#235 兆), you can see that a <em>dog</em>, wanting to preserve its<strong> status quo</strong> among its pals, tries to bite the <em>back</em> of a poor postman."	The<strong> STATUS QUO</strong> was broken when the TURTLE and the DOG got married! You should have see the offspring… Dogs with shells on!!		
黙		silence	"Oddly enough, the character for <b>silence</b> shows us a <i>black chihuahua</i>. Actually, the cute little critter's name is Darkness, as I am sure you remember from the famous song about <b>silence</b> that begins, ""Hello, Darkness, my old friend...."" Note how the four dots reach all the way across the bottom of the character."		15	255	240	11	モク、ボク	だま.る、もだ.す	The <em>computer</em> won't stop beeping, which is making the <em>chihauhua</em> bark, and it's driving this guy insane. The only solution he can come up with is to throw them both on the <em>fire</em> and finally enjoy the<strong> silence</strong>.	Your neighbor is so sick of you playing Led Zeppelin that he takes your copy of the song Black Dog and burns it. Finally,<strong> silence</strong> in the neighborhood.	A scene of calm SILENC: You're typing away on your COMPUTER, while your pet DOG lies beside, a nice FIRE warms you both. No noise to disturb the<strong> SILENCE</strong>.	<strong>Silence</strong> is a paramount for any <em>black</em> ninja <em>dog</em>.	HINT: this is NOT black and dog. It is computer, dog and fire. So my risque but memorable story is: sitting at the naked at the <em>computer</em> watching <em>doggystyle</em> porn with a <em>fire</em> to keep me warm. It suddenly gets louder and I have to hit the mute, or<strong> silence</strong> button so as not to disturb the neighbours… Apologies for the rudeness, but was having trouble remembering and this made it stick.		
然		sort of thing	"The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality; hence we refer to it as ""<b>sort of thing</b>."" Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an <i>oven flame</i> with the <i>flesh</i> of a <i>chihuahua</i> being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a ""hot-diggity, dog-diggity"" <b>sort of thing</b>."		12	256	241	11	ゼン、ネン	しか、しか.り、しか.し、さ	"<em>Flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> over a cooking fire = ""hotdog"". There are all <strong>sorts of things</strong> in <em>hot dogs</em>. Believe me, you don't want to know what <strong>sort of things</strong> . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr's. Thanks!)."	There are all <strong>sorts of things</strong> in <em>hot dogs</em>. (I use <em>hot dog</em> for this primitive (<em>meat</em> of a <em>dog</em> over a <em>cooking fire</em>). I swear I can actually see the 月 here as a hot dog, with its slight curve and grill marks.).	Putting the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> on a <em>fire</em> is the<strong> sort of thing</strong> that will get you arrested.	Imagine the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> roasting OVER a fire. Gross. I'd never want to eat that<strong> sort of thing</strong>.	The <em>moon</em> in the <em>evening</em> is the <strong>sort of thing</strong> that makes a <em>dog</em> howl as if <em>on fire</em>.		
荻		reed	"You've no doubt seen cattails, those swamp <b>reeds</b> with a furry <i>flower</i> to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome <i>pack of wild dogs</i>: lure them into a swamp of these <b>reeds</b> with the cattail <i>flowers</i> and then set <i>fire</i> to the swamp. Take care to focus on the <i>flower</i> rather than the ""cattail"" to avoid confusion with frame 259 below."		10	257	242	11	テキ	おぎ	<strong>REED</strong>S are the only FLOWERS that WILD DOGS like to FIRE up and smoke while they are playing poker.	A<strong> reed</strong> is a flower that looks like a hot dog.	Picture a Gary Larson cartoon of a pack of <em>dogs</em> sitting around a <em>campfire</em>. They misunderstood something they overheard, and can't understand why they're not getting high smoking<strong> reed</strong>. In the kanji, you can actually see the dog smoking the<strong> reed</strong> in a crack pipe held over the fire. (Thanks, chamcham!).	<strong>Reed</strong>s: the only flowers that can survive fire and dogs.	<em>pack of dogs</em> hanging out by the <em>fire</em> smoking <em>reed</em> <em>flowers</em>.		
狩		hunt	One of the worst problems you have to face when you go <b>hunting</b> is to <i>guard</i> your take from the <i>wild dogs</i>. If you imagine yourself failing at the task, you will probably have a stronger image than if you try to picture yourself succeeding.		9	258	243	11	シュ	か.る、か.り、-が.り	Actually when <strong>hunting</strong> it may be a good idea to use a <em>pack of dogs</em> as your personal <em>guard</em>.	After a <em>pack of wild dogs</em><strong> hunt</strong> some food, they will <em>guard</em> it fiercely.	In every prison escape movie, the<strong> hunt</strong> for the escapees involves a pack of WILD DOGS unleashed by the GUARDS.	In Duck<strong> Hunt</strong>, that <em>dog</em> is damned lucky the game <em>protects</em> him, or I'd shot him by now.	Imagine: you sit in the porch of your <em>house</em>, rub your pack of <em>wild dogs</em> vigorously with <em>glue</em> and send them off to<strong> HUNT</strong> rabbits by rolling on them and returning with the poor little critters <em>glued</em> to them. Supposedly, the Russians trained dogs with mines on their backs to run under German tanks in WWII, so the idea is feasible.		
猫		cat	"Knowing how much dogs love to chase <b>cats</b>, picture a <i>pack of wild dogs</i> planting ""<b>cat</b>-<i>seedlings</i>,"" watering them, and fertilizing them until they can be harvested as a crop of <b>cats</b> for them to chase and torment. If you begin from the key word and think of a ""crop of <b>cats</b>,"" you will not confuse this story with the apparently similar story of two frames ago."		11	259	244	11	ビョウ	ねこ	The<strong> cat</strong> hid in the FLOWERS of the FIELD from the WILD DOGs.	Dawgs always wanna put their seedlings in pussies.	It looks like a<strong> cat</strong>. The flowers are the ears, the field is the face, and the dog is the tail.	Packs of wild dogs will chase a<strong> cat</strong> through flowers and fields.	The crafty<strong> cat</strong> hid from the pack of dogs among the seedlings.		
牛		cow	"Can you the ""doodle"" of a <b>cow</b> that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs."	* As a primitive, the same sense of <i>cow</i> is kept. Note only that when it is placed OVER another element, its tail is cut off. In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed.	4	260	245	11	ギュウ	うし	A<strong> cow</strong> tried to climb up a vermilion tree, but in doing so, it broke its two bottom branches off.	Mooooooooooooooooooo!!!!	A<strong> cow</strong> bleeds <em>vermilion</em> when you cut off two of it's legs.	No matter how many times you roll over the<strong> cow</strong> with a steam-roller, it will still be two strokes short of looking as vivid red as <em>vermillion</em> pigment.	This is a<strong> cow</strong>…<strong> Cow</strong> - How you say? Imagine a<strong> cow</strong> which has just been run over by a steamroller. Now you see, the head to one side, four legs and the tail backwards. Yes that is indeed a<strong> cow</strong>.		
特		special	Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word <b>special</b> distinct from the character we met earlier for <i>specialty</i> (Frame 47), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji. Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a <b>special</b> class all its own - like the sacred <i>cows</i> of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the <i>cows</i> should be placed on the sacred grounds of a <i>Buddhist temple</i> in this kanji.		10	261	246	11	トク		Think of not<strong> special</strong> people, but<strong> special</strong> animals. The sacred Hindu <em>cows</em> are<strong> special</strong> - they can wander around the <em>temple</em> without fear of becoming roast beef.	"The Church Lady is traveling through Japan and notices with distaste a sacred <em>cow</em> relieving itself inside a <em>Buddhist Temple</em>. ""Well, isn't <em>that</em> <strong>special</strong>""."	<em>Cow</em>s at a <em>Buddhist temple</em> are<strong> special</strong> - they are holy cows! Sadly a few days later I find the same <em>cow</em>s' meat on<strong> special</strong> at the supermarket. Holy Cow, what have we done!?	<strong>Cows</strong> are<strong> special</strong> when <em>left</em> <strong>in temples</strong>.	Mixing up Hinduism and Buddhism, the <em>cow</em> ended up as today's<strong> special</strong> at the <em>Buddhist temple</em>.		
告		revelation	Folklore throughout the world tells us of talking animals who show a wisdom superior to that of human beings, and that same tradition has found its way into television shows and cartoons right into our own century. This character depicts <b>revelation</b> through the <i>mouth</i> of a <i>cow</i>, suggesting oracular utterances about truths hidden to human intelligence.		7	262	247	11	コク	つ.げる	"The<strong> revelation</strong> makes the cow's mouth drop down, ""Hamburgers are made of what?!""."	"In ancient times, the words from a <em>primitive cow's mouth</em> were considered a<strong> REVELATION</strong> because they were the ""udder truth.""."	When you get a<strong> revelation</strong>, you may <em>drop</em> to the <em>ground</em> with your <em>mouth</em> wide open.	"Ask an enlightened Zen monk for a single word of<strong> revelation</strong>, then go and ask any cow for the same thing. You""ll probably get the same answer– ""Muuuuu!"" Spiritual<strong> revelation</strong> coming out of the mouth of a cow."	"The<strong> revelation</strong> makes the <em>cow</em>'s <em>mouth</em> drop open. ""Hamburgers are made of <em>what</em>?"" Think of a Gary Larson cartoon. (Slight tweak of pageturner's)."		
先		before	"Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a <i>cow</i> with <i>human legs</i>, as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a <i>cow</i>-suit. I always thought I'd prefer to be the one standing <b>before</b>, rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the ""butt"" of everyone's laughter."		6	263	248	11	セン	さき、ま.ず	I've never seen a <em>cow</em> with <em>human legs</em><strong> before</strong>!	"Nasty story but it keeps the meaning true to the kanji. ""BEFORE you stick it in a COW and SPREAD the legs (the bottom stroke of this cow looks like two legs) make sure she has HUMAN LEGS""————-sorry, I'll remove if I get enough reports, but will keep if I get more stars."	<strong>Before</strong> Human Beings Existed.. Minotaurs Ruled The Earth! Their Top Half A Cow And Their Bottom Half Human Legs! Also: Using Minotaur as a primitive can make stories a doddle!	"I've never seen a cow with human legs<strong> before</strong>! (from gaijinda) I keep mixing this up with <a href=""../v4/290.html"">in front</a> (#290 前). Remember that<strong> before</strong> sounds like ""beef or"", so it must be the one with the cow in it."	"Note: If you are confusing ""before"" 先 with ""in front"" 前 , then note that ""before"" sounds like ""<strong>beef</strong> or"", so that must be the one with the <em>cow</em> in it."		
洗		wash	"This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the elements speak for themselves: <i>water</i> . . . <i>before</i>. But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once. Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called ""Pigpen,"" who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him ""<b>Wash</b>-Out."" Everywhere he walks, a spray of <i>water</i> goes <i>before</i> him to sanitize everything he touches."		9	264	249	11	セン	あら.う	In Japan, you always<strong> wash</strong> with <em>water</em> from the shower <em>before</em> you enter the bathtub.	You<strong> wash</strong> things with WATER to get them back to the clean state they were in BEFORE.	<strong>WASH</strong> with WATER BEFORE doing anything.	You need <em>water</em> <em>before</em> you can<strong> wash</strong>.	In 1525, the city of Salzburg was occupied. Legend has it that there was nothing left to eat, except for one <em>cow</em>. To trick the occupying forces, people would paint the cow, and send a human (with <em>human legs</em>) and the <em>cow</em> out for a walk, clearly visible to the enemies. Then, they would use some <em>water</em> to <strong>wash</strong> the <em>cow</em> and paint it with a different colour and so on. Seeing there were still plenty of <em>cows</em> left, the occupiers finally gave up. The people of Salzburg are still called <em>cow</em>-<strong>wash</strong>ers.		
介		jammed in	The idea of something getting <b>jammed into</b> something else is depicted here by having a <i>walking stick</i> get <b>jammed into</b> an <i>umbrella</i> frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the <i>umbrella</i> stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight <i>walking stick</i>. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant.		4	265	250	12	カイ		"The two strokes at the bottom look like a J and I, which stands for ""jammed in.""."	Two people<strong> jammed in</strong> under an <strong>umbrella</strong>. A woman with a dress and a man (straight). It's always me that ends up getting wet…. but the tail of the skirt is this time!	"J and I are ""Jammed Into"" an UMBRELLA."	The <em>beach umbrella</em> is<strong> jammed in</strong>to the sand using <em>two poles</em> instead of one, so it's extra steady. I was a little rough though so I accidentally bent one of them.	介する 【かいする】 (vs-s,vt) (1) (See を介して ) to use as an intermediary; to mediate; to assist; (2) to worry; to mind; to care. STORY: It's raining out and you are arguing with your bf/gf about why they didn't bring their own UMBRELLA. Now the two of you are<strong> JAMMED IN</strong> under one (J and I just how lucidfaia said). Then imagine another person who forgot their UMBRELLA JAMMES IN with you and offers to MEDIATE your argument in exchange for protection from the rain.		
界		world	As the <b>world</b> gets <i>jammed</i> with more and more people, there is less and less space. Imagine yourself taking an air flight over a <b>world</b> so densely populated that every bit of it is sectioned off like a gigantic checkerboard (the <i>rice fields</i>). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more is being <b>jammed into</b> that already narrow space.		9	266	251	12	カイ		One Japanese farmer I know is so small minded that he thinks the entire<strong> world</strong> is JAMMED IN the borders of his little RICE FIELD.	A famous philosopher once said that his<strong> world</strong> consisted of all the things he could <em>jam into</em> his <em>brain</em>.	If you fit everyone in the<strong> world</strong> into a <em>rice field</em>, they would be pretty <em>jammed in</em>.	The<strong> world</strong> is just one big ol' RICE FIELD with billions of people JAMMED IN.	This is a pictograph of a MISS<strong> WORLD</strong>. She was the only contestant with a BRAIN, and the curved stroke is her bent leg (think curtsy) or her sweeping elegant dress.		
茶		tea	As everyone knows, <b>tea</b> is made from <b>tea</b> leaves. But the <b>tea</b> plant itself has its own <i>flowers</i>, which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the <i>tea</i>, as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of <i>flowering</i> <b>tea</b> bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g <i>wooden poles</i> (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny <i>umbrella</i> at the top to shade the delicate-tasting <b>tea</b> <i>flowers</i>.		9	267	252	12	チャ、サ		Some people think drinking<strong> tea</strong> is boring and quaint. That's why I spice mine up by adding a cocktail umbrella, which of course is made from a <em>wood</em>-en toothpick supporting a paper <em>umbrella</em> with <em>flowers</em> printed on top.	"When I drink <em>herbal</em><strong> tea</strong> I like to drink it under a <em>parasol</em>. If it's too hot I go ""ho, ho, ho !!"" (katakana ホ)."	<strong>Tea</strong> is made from <em>flowers</em> dried under a <em>canopy</em> held up with <em>wooden poles</em>.	"The ""flowers"" of the ""umbrella tree"" make the best<strong> TEA</strong>."	That sexy ho (ホ) under the flowery umbrella is just my cup of<strong> tea</strong>.		
脊		spinal column	"The <b>spinal column</b> has sprouted out of the <i>flesh</i> of your back into an <i>umbrella</i> that you always have with you, rain or shine. The pair of 2s on each side are the ""ribs"" of the <i>umbrella</i>. Take care to keep your image of the key word distinct from that for spine (Frame 24)."		10	268	2071	12	セキ	せ、せい	"""Look"", says the teacher in biology class. ""The<strong> spinal column</strong> holds your <em>flesh</em> together, just like the metal rod of this <em>umbrella</em> (he demonstrates this with an umbrella covered in <em>I-Ching</em> symbols) holds the umbrella together""."	A pictograph of a<strong> spinal column</strong>. The <em>umbrella</em> representing the shoulder blades, the <em>I Ching</em> as the shoulder muscles and the <em>part of the body</em> as the spine itself.	The<strong> spinal column</strong> functions in the same way the rod does in an <em>umbrella</em>… To hold one's <em>umbrella of flesh</em> together, much like the <em>I Ching</em> does for the universe.	In a horrific accident, a <em>body part</em> got <em>jammed in</em> the <em>grill</em> of my car: a<strong> spinal column</strong>!	When my Korean girlfriend (from the I CHING symbols on the Korean flag) stands under an UMBRELLA and stretches her BODY, you can see the outline of her<strong> spinal column</strong>.		
合		fit	The kanji for <b>fit</b> reads literally, top to bottom, as a <i>meeting</i> of <i>mouths</i> - which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people's ideas don't <b>fit</b> with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what would happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose <i>mouths</i> didn't <b>fit</b>.		6	269	253	12	ゴウ、ガッ、カッ	あ.う、-あ.う、あ.い、あい-、-あ.い、-あい、あ.わす、あ.わせる、-あ.わせる	I wouldn't mind a <em>meeting</em> of <em>mouths</em> with her, she's really<strong> fit</strong> !	He had such a big <em>mouth</em> that he could easily<strong> fit</strong> <em>one</em> whole <em>umbrella</em> in it.	<em>Meeting</em> of <em>mouths</em>! We<strong> fit</strong> together so well, darling ;).	This umbrella is so small you can only<strong> fit</strong> one mouth under it (one person).	Only <em>one</em> <em>mouth</em> can<strong> fit</strong> under an <em>umbrella</em>. (If you don't believe me try to<strong> fit</strong> two and see how they will get wet.).		
塔		pagoda	On the left we see a mound of <i>dirt</i>, and to the right <i>flowers</i> made to <i>fit</i> together. The two sides combine to create a great <b>pagoda</b> made of <i>dirt</i>, with <i>flowers</i> by the tens of thousands <i>fitted</i> together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and <i>fit</i> a few of the <i>flowers</i> in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force.		12	270	254	12	トウ		In order to build a<strong> pagoda</strong> in this small Japanese garden everything has to <em>fit</em>: the <em>soil</em> to the left and the <em>flowers</em> in the upper right corner.	Pictograph-o-rama. This is a corner of a Japanese garden, with a small mound of <em>soil</em> on the left, and a little concrete<strong> pagoda</strong> in the front with <em>flowers</em> behind it. (To my eye, the <em>fit</em> looks a lot like a little<strong> pagoda</strong> anyway. This may or may not cause confusion for you, though…).	The <em>ground</em> next to the<strong> pagoda</strong> could barely <em>fit</em> all the <em>flowers</em> the empress wanted planted.	Thankfully I was in a <strong>pagoda</strong> when I, ummm, <em>soil</em>ed myself, the <em>flowers</em> covered up the smell and the mess <em>fit</em> out one of the holes in the side while no one was watching…	"A<strong> pagoda</strong> is a place of harmony in Japan. This means that even the ""soil"" where ""flowers"" are planted must ""fit"" together (good for remembering the order of writing)."		
王		king	See what you can do to come up with a pictograph of a <b>king's</b> scepter here that suits your own idea of what it should look like. You might even begin with the basic element for <i>I beam</i> and then try to fit the remaining third stroke in.	* As a primitive, this can mean either <i>king</i> or <i>scepter</i>, but it will usually be taken to mean <i>ball,</i> as an abbreviation of the character in the next frame.	4	271	255	12	オウ、ノウ		To be<strong> king</strong> you have to be a real <em>crafty one</em> !	A<strong> King</strong> is one（ 一 ） who rules over the land （ 土 soil）.	The<strong> king</strong> unites heaven and earth. (imagine heaven being the top line over the <em>soil</em>).	Everyone made fun the<strong> king</strong> because the end of his scepter had three pancakes on it.	In a card game,<strong> king</strong> is 13 ( 十 and 三 ) together. i.e. queen is 12, jack is 11….		
玉		jewel	Note the <i>drop</i> here in the king's <i>scepter</i>, which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious <b>jewel</b> handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power.	* As a primitive, we can use this to mean either <i>jewel</i> or <i>ball</i>. When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame.	5	272	256	12	ギョク	たま、たま-、-だま	The king is said to have only one family<strong> jewel</strong> below the belt…	"The king is said to have only one family<strong> jewel</strong> below the belt…and he hangs left! (I always screw up the direction of the ""drop"")."	I can tell you that there is only one thing that Japanese people think when they see this Kanji, and that's BALLS(no joke). Kintama, or gold balls, means testicles. Funny story, we met a European girl not to long ago who had this as a tattoo, and she thought it actually meant<strong> JEWEL</strong>. But as I said, the Japanese guys wanted to know why she liked BALLS so much. lol (True Story).	Only Kings can poop<strong> jewel</strong>s.	King dropped his pants to reveal his<strong> jewel</strong>.		
宝		treasure	Every <i>house</i> has its <b>treasure</b>, as every thief knows only too well. While the things we <b>treasure</b> most are usually of sentimental value, we take the original sense of the term <b>treasure</b> here and make it refer to <i>jewels</i> kept in one's <i>house</i>.		8	273	257	12	ホウ	たから	On<strong> treasure</strong> island is a single <em>house</em> - where all the <em> jewels</em> are stored.	"Put a ""<em>roof</em>"" (lid) on your <em>jewels</em> and voila! You've got a<strong> treasure</strong> chest."	I have<strong> treasure</strong>: <em>jewels</em> which I hide in my <em>house</em>.	If Wealth and Savings aren't confusing enough, we now add<strong> Treasure</strong>. They all have House. Savings account had a nail and a shell. While Wealthy had the Wealth primitive in it. In this case, our<strong> Treasure</strong> is a HOUSE full of JEWELS.	The<strong> treasure</strong> chest houses the jewels.		
珠		pearl	Take care to keep the meaning of this kanji distinct from that for <i>jewel</i>. Think of the most enormous <b>pearl</b> you have ever seen, a great <i>vermilion</i>-colored <i>ball</i> sitting on your ring and making it extremely difficult to move without falling over from the weight of the thing.		10	274	258	12	シュ	たま	The king of the Oysters produces special Vermillion<strong> pearl</strong>s!	King Vermillion is a little queer and likes to wear<strong> pearl</strong> necklaces.	Usually <strong>pearls</strong> are white, or black. Only a very rare, very expensive<strong> pearl</strong> is <em>vermillion</em> colored. Such a <strong>pearl</strong> would be fit for a <em>king</em>.	The <em>king</em> made everyone turn a bright shade of <em>vermilion</em> when he showed up wearing a<strong> PEARL</strong> necklace. (Tweaked for positioning purposes. Thanks ngoli1).	"I gave the princess a <strong>pearl</strong> necklace and the <a href=""../v4/255.html"">king</a> (#255 王) turned a bright shade of <a href=""../v4/221.html"">vermilion</a> (#221 朱) when he saw it on her."		
現		present	"Do not think of a ""gift"" here, but of the <b>present</b> moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a <i>ball</i> in which we see the <b>present</b> - obviously a crystal <i>ball</i> that enables us to <i>see</i> things going on at the <b>present</b> in faraway places."		11	275	259	12	ゲン	あらわ.れる、あらわ.す、うつつ、うつ.つ	<em>The KING</em> … can <em>SEE</em> clearly the<strong> PRESENT</strong> state of affairs in the land. (maybe he hees them in the crystal ball on the left?).	Hey, I want my money back! This crystal <em>ball</em> is out of order, I can <em>see</em> the<strong> present</strong> instead of the future!	Many people claim that Elvis (The KING) has been SEEN walking around in the<strong> PRESENT</strong>.	The king came…the king saw…thus, the king was<strong> present</strong>.	"The palintir shows only what's happening NOW - the<strong> present</strong> - to the all-<em>see</em>ing eye of Sauron. Unfortunate overlap of keywords. I sometimes write 贈 <a href=""../v4/503.html"">presents</a> (#503 贈) when given this keyword for review."		
玩		toy	If, at some aboriginal level, <b>Toys</b> Я Us, then the archetypal <i>ball</i> must have been there at the <i>beginning</i>, before evolving into beach balls, ping-pong balls, rugby balls, and marbles.		8	276	2567	12	ガン	もちあそ.ぶ、もてあそ.ぶ	The <em>ball</em> was the only thing that people at the <em>beginning</em> of time had to use as a<strong> toy</strong>. Poor cavemen.	Even the <em>king</em> played with<strong> toy</strong>s in the <em>beginning</em>.	And so it was, the <em>ball</em> marked the <em>beginning</em> of all the <strong>toys</strong> that were to come.	玩 depicts one of the most ancient<strong> TOY</strong>s known to mankind: <em>MARBLES</em>. The use of such small <em>BALL</em>s for play goes back to the <em>BEGINNING</em> of recorded history. (<strong>TOY</strong> <em>MARBLES</em> were found in Egyptian pyramids, for example.).	"Mnemonic ""<strong>toy</strong> boy"" - From the days of the garden of eden boys have used their <em>balls</em> as<strong> toy</strong>s."		
狂		lunatic	"A <b>lunatic</b> is literally one driven mad by the light of the moon, and the most famous of the ""<b>looneys</b>"" are the legendary lycanthropes or ""wolfmen."" Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon, sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this kanji, imagine one of these lycanthropes going <b>looney</b> and setting himself up as <i>king</i> of a <i>pack of wild dogs</i> that roams about and terrorizes innocent suburban communities."		7	277	260	12	キョウ	くる.う、くる.おしい、くるお.しい	Oh no ! A <em>pack of dogs</em> has bitten the <em>king</em>. He has turned into a rabid<strong> lunatic</strong> !	Think of <em>King</em> Nebuchadnezzar, who for 7 years <strong>lost his sanity</strong> and had to live like a <em>wild animal</em>.	The <em>wild dog king</em> (Red XIII) had an awesome limit break -<strong> Lunatic</strong> High!	Only a<strong> lunatic</strong> would use a <em>wild pack of dogs</em> to protect the <em>king</em>.	The <em>Dog king</em> was a<strong> lunatic</strong>. In fact, he was a laughing hyena. Use the<strong> lunatic</strong> hyena(dog) in the Lion <em>King</em> if it helps.		
旺		effulgent	The radiant, <b>effulgent</b> splendor of he <i>sun</i> makes it <i>king</i> of all the planets and other stars. Just to be sure you don't take this too abstractly, picture the <i>sun</i> seated on a throne, flourishing its <i>scepter</i> this way and that.		8	278	2450	12	オウ、キョウ、ゴウ	かがや.き、うつくし.い、さかん	The <em>Sun King</em> (Louis XIV) was known for his<strong> effulgent</strong> reign.	"[+katsuo] This is the <em>Sun King</em>. Sayeth Wikipedia: ""The <em>Sun King</em> (in French le Roi Soleil) because of the idea that, just as the planets revolve around the <em>Sun</em>, so too should France and the court revolve around [the <em>king</em>] (""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France</a>). And just like the <em>sun</em>, he was quite<strong> effulgent</strong> and actually emitted <em>sun</em>light."	The <em>sun</em> is the<strong> effulgent</strong> <em>king</em> of stars.	The sun is the king of<strong> effulgent</strong> bodies in the sky.	Eeffulgent? I'll never remember that. Renaming this <strong>full of vigor</strong>. The <em>king</em> always started the <em>day</em> <strong>full of vigor</strong>, ready to rule his kingdom like the nobles of old.		
皇		emperor	An <b>emperor</b>, as we all know, is a ruler - something like a <i>king</i> but higher in status. The <i>white bird</i> perched above the <i>king</i>, elevating him to <b>imperial</b> heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that <i>white birds</i> have long done in folklore throughout the world.		9	279	261	12	コウ、オウ		Ancient Rome had<strong> Emperor</strong>s instead of Kings, and they wore white robes. Thus an<strong> emperor</strong> is a <em>king</em> in <em>white</em>. (make sure you picture a roman<strong> emperor</strong> not a japanese one and you'll be ok).	I don't think the Japanese would be happy if their<strong> emperor</strong> was a <em>white king</em>…	The white dove descended on the king and he was promoted to<strong> emperor</strong>.	An<strong> emperor</strong> is a holy king. In Japanese Shinto white is the holiest color.	Whenever I think an<strong> Emperor</strong> I always think of<strong> Emperor</strong> Palpatine from Star Wars. He is the <em>king</em> of all the <em>white</em> stormtroopers.		
呈		display	"The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word with the line from the nursery rhyme about 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: ""Wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the <i>king</i>?"" If we think of <b>display</b> in terms of that famous line, and the <i>king</i> with his head thrown back and his <i>mouth</i> wide open as 4 and 20 blackbirds fly in one after the other, we shall have satisfied both the elements and their position."		7	280	262	12	テイ		The mouth of the king is<strong> display</strong>ing his bling.	What a pathetic<strong> display</strong>! The <em>king</em> is sprawled on his throne, head back and <em>mouth</em> wide open, fast asleep. We should never have let him drink so much at that banquet last night.	The mouth of the king<strong> display</strong>ed what a fool he was.	"Think of an evil museum that<strong> display</strong>s the <em>mouths</em> of the previous dead <em>kings</em>. Imagine the tour guide dressed up in sinister clothing saying, ""And on<strong> display</strong> here, we have the <em>mouth</em> of <em>King</em> Henry VIII""."	The original court jesters had a terrible job, if the <em>king</em>'s <em>mouth</em> yawned during your<strong> DISPLAY</strong>, it was the end of you.		
全		whole	"<b>Wholeness</b> suggests physical and spiritual health, ""having your act together."" The kanji-image for <b>wholeness</b> depicts being ""<i>king</i> under your own <i>umbrella</i>,"" that is, giving order to your own life. I know it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word <b>whole</b>?"		6	281	263	12	ゼン	まった.く、すべ.て	"The fat <em>king</em> hogs the<strong> whole</strong> space under his <em>umbrella</em>. (tweaked version of radical tyro's story. ""fat"" makes a more vivid image for me.)."	The <em>king</em> takes up the<strong> whole</strong> space under his <em>umbrella</em>.	King Arthur united the<strong> whole</strong> of England under his umbrella. (The umbrella methophore works pretty good here, due to England's miserable weather).	You need a king sized umbrella to keep your<strong> whole</strong> body dry.	This is similar to radical_tyro's story, but has a few points that help me. Whenever it rains, the <em>king</em> hogs the<strong> whole</strong> <em>umbrella,</em> and we can't do anything about it (because, after all, he is the <em>king</em>).		
栓		plug	Here we think of <b>plug</b> in the sense of a cork or stopper used to seal the mouth of a bottle, water faucet, or something with liquid running out of it. Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>ball</i>. Imagine a <i>tree</i> with a faucet in the side out of which tennis <i>balls</i> are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach <i>umbrella</i> into the <i>tree</i> to <b>plug</b> it up.		10	282	264	12	セン		"The fat <em>king</em> under his <em>umbrella</em> offers useless advice to the workers. ""You'll need the <em>whole</em> <em>tree</em> to<strong> plug</strong> that gap"". Imagine a grossly fat, incompetent king under a parasol giving annoying advice to sweating workers who know what they're doing. (I always have trouble bringing up the ""whole"" primitive. This story reminds me how to build that part. )."	To<strong> plug</strong> the hole, you need to use a <em>whole</em> piece of <em>wood</em> - like a cork or something.	Best example of a<strong> plug</strong> is a cork. A piece of <em>wood</em> that covers the <em>whole</em> opening (else it would leak).	Trees and umbrellas are some king sized butt<strong> plug</strong>s. Ouch.	To<strong> plug</strong> the hole in the dam, use the <strong>whole</strong> damn <strong>tree</strong>.		
理		logic	We first referred to this character back in frame 185, to which you might want to return to have a peek. The image of <b>logic</b> we are given is something like a central <i>jewel</i> in a <i>computer</i>, like the <i>jewels</i> in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the rams and roms and approaching this shining <i>jewel</i>, a chorus of voice sand a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all-knowing <b>logic</b>.		11	283	265	12	リ	ことわり	The king of<strong> LOGIC</strong> is the computer.	Computers are ruled by<strong> logic</strong> (it is the king of computers).	"If you used the meaning ""House of the Parents"" for <a href=""../v4/173.html"">ri</a> (#173 里), you will know then that, as<strong> logic</strong> dictates, the <em>King</em> must rule on his own Kingdom (the <em>House of his Parents</em>)."	The <em>king</em> of<strong> logic</strong> is the <em>computer</em>!	<strong>LOGIC</strong> reigns <em>king</em> at my <em>parent's house</em> = no bullshitting my wise mom or dad with silly stories!		
主		lord	"A man's home is his castle, goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was <b>lord</b> of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or <i>drop</i>) of a <i>king</i> in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to ""read off"" the primitives in this way, you won't end up putting the <i>drop</i> down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel."	* As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass <i>candlestick</i> (with the drop representing the flame at the top).	5	284	266	12	シュ、ス、シュウ	ぬし、おも、あるじ	A<strong> lord</strong> is a little <em>drop</em> down from <em>King</em> in hierarchy.	A<strong> lord</strong> only has a drop of the king's power.	"Although this kanji's meaning hasn't caused me much trouble, I've had problems remembering the direction of the <em>drop</em> above <em>king</em>, since <em>drops</em> at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions. To remember this one, I think of the placement of the <em>drop</em> in <em>jewel</em> (#256 玉). Both of them use the <em>king</em> primitive and include a short <em>drop</em> stroke going from the top left to bottom right."	Oh<strong> lord</strong>! someone spat on the king.	The<strong> lord</strong> wants to DROP something on the KING'S head so he can become king himself.		
注		pour	Picture <b>pouring</b> water from a lighted <i>candlestick</i>. What could be more ridiculous, or simpler, as a way to recall this kanji?		8	285	267	12	チュウ	そそ.ぐ、さ.す、つ.ぐ	Visualize an idiot trying to figure out how to extinguish a candle. He sees a glass of WATER and decides to<strong> pour</strong> it onto the CANDLESTICK to put it out. Water spills everywhere.	Like water the hot wax<strong> pour</strong>ed down the side of the candlestick.	"""WATER, my LORD ? I'll<strong> pour</strong>""."	When you<strong> pour</strong> you are the <em>water lord</em>.	The lord always<strong> pour</strong>s for the king.		
柱		pillar	The <b>pillar</b> referred to here is the <i>wooden</i> beam that stands at the entrance to a traditional Japanese house. Carve it in imagination into the shape of a gigantic <i>candlestick</i> and your work is done.		9	286	268	12	チュウ	はしら	The main<strong> pillar</strong> in a house should be made of the biggest and strongest tree - the <em>lord</em> of the <em>trees</em>.	"""Why has this<strong> pillar</strong> been carved in the shape of a giant penis?!"" ""You said that 'it should be made of <em>wood</em>', My <em>Lord</em>.""."	"""<em>Wood</em> <em>Lord</em>, what a<strong> pillar</strong>!"", she said."	This <em>wood</em>en<strong> pillar</strong> is like the <em>lord</em> of the house… (remove it and the whole house will collapse).	Imagine a<strong> pillar</strong> that looks like a huge <em>kingly candlestick</em> with a flame at the top, that is leaning to the left about to set a <em>tree</em> next to it on fire.		
金		gold	If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of <b>gold</b> bullion with an <i>umbrella</i> overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the <i>scepters</i> of the kingdom, <i>drop</i> by <i>drop</i>, and shaping them into bars.	* As a primitive, it means not only <i>gold</i> but any <i>metal</i> at all.	8	287	269	12	キン、コン、ゴン	かね、かな-、-がね	The fat <em>king</em> taking up the <em>whole</em> space under the <em>umbrella</em> actually isn't fat - he just has two big<strong> gold</strong> bars hidden under his clothes.	"Under the <em>umbrella's</em> shade, the king sang, "" <em>Drop</em> it to the left, <em>drop</em> it to the right, give me all the<strong> GOLD</strong> in sight!""."	"The <a href=""../v4/255.html"">king</a> (#255 王) walks under the <em>umbrella</em> with a bag of<strong> gold</strong> on both side."	<em>King</em> Midas shelters from the rain under his <em>umbrella</em>. Every now and again he reaches out with his hands to turn a couple of rain<em>drops</em> into<strong> gold</strong>, and puts them in his pockets.	Give me two DROPS of<strong> gold</strong> and I will give you my WHOLE body.		
銑		pig iron	"<b>Pig iron</b> refers to iron in the crude form in which it emerges from the smelting furnaces. Of all the various forms <i>metal</i> can take, this one shows us <i>metal</i> <i>before</i> it has been refined. Imagine two photographs labeled ""<i>before</i>"" and ""after"" to show the process."		14	288	270	12	セン		<strong>Pig iron</strong> is basic/crude <em>metal</em>, that is, <em>before</em> it has been processed.	<strong>Pig-iron</strong> is crude <em>metal</em> ( 金 ) <em>before</em> ( 先 ) it is refined. If you have trouble with this character, envision a big minotaur (<em>cow</em> head with <em>human legs</em>) as a blacksmith, smelting metals and making swords for war.	100% of Japanese university graduates claim to have never seen this character, so impress them by remembering it,<strong> Pig-iron</strong> is metal <em>before</em> it has been processed. (Just a copy of the most common used story but with this little fact added, really impress your japanese friends or teachers by learning this one).	<strong>PIG-IRON</strong> is the condition of IRON BEFORE it has been processed.	GOLD BEFORE an alchemist touches it is pig iron.		
鉢		bowl	Let <b>bowl</b> suggest a large and heavy <i>golden</i> <b>bowl</b> into which you are throwing all the <i>books</i> you own to mash them into pulp, for some outrageous reason you will have to think up yourself.		13	289	271	12	ハチ、ハツ		This is the<strong> BOWL</strong> of an alchemist: see how he mixes <em>metals</em> in his<strong> bowl</strong>, as he follows the instructions from his <em>book</em>?	If I was begging with a<strong> BOWL</strong>, I would want GOLD and BOOKS.	I actually picture a <em>book</em> made of <em>gold</em> that's been warped (due to the malleability of gold) so that it has a dent in the middle that can be used as a<strong> bowl</strong>.	This is a great way to learn a lot of knowledge in a little bit of time. You get a <em>metal</em><strong> bowl</strong> and throw in as many <em>books</em> as you can! Keep'em coming! Once you have every book you can think of that you have read or want to read in that<strong> bowl</strong> grind'em all up!	The winners of the super<strong> bowl</strong> get <em>gold</em> rings, while the losers just get a mention in the record <em>book</em>.		
銅		copper	"Picture an order of <i>monks</i> serving as chaplains for the police force. Their special habit, made of protective <i>metal</i>, is distinguished by a row of <b>copper</b> buttons just like the ""<b>cops</b>"" they serve."		14	290	272	12	ドウ	あかがね	I can't believe no one has used this one yet: <strong>Copper</strong> is <em>metal</em> which looks almost <em>the same</em> as <em>gold</em>. Really, look it up on Wikipedia, it's yellow and it's shiny (atleast in some compounds)!	<strong>Copper</strong> is an excellent conductor. In other words, it's a <em>metal</em> for which the voltage is the <em>same</em> everywhere. That's why it's used for wires.	A <em>metal</em> that looks the <em>same</em> as <em>gold</em> is<strong> COPPER</strong>.	"<strong>Copper</strong> and <em>gold</em> are in the <em>same</em> column of the periodic table. And now what am I going to do for 銀 <a href=""../v4/1459.html"">silver</a> (#1459 銀)????"	<strong>Copper</strong> is a metal, the <em>same</em> as <em>gold</em>.		
釣		angling	The character we learned for <i>fishing</i> (Frame 184) refers to the professional, net-casting industry, while the <b>angling</b> of this character refers to the sport. The odd thing is that your <b>angling</b> rod is a <i>golden</i> <i>ladle</i> which you are using to scoop <i>gold</i>fish out of a river.		11	291	273	12	チョウ	つ.る、つ.り、つ.り-	All the people that go to the Japanese festivals to catch fish part time are suckers. Me? I'm a pro. I bring a big-ass <strong>golden</strong> <strong>ladle</strong>. I'm a true<strong> ANGLING</strong> professional.	The easiest<strong> angling</strong> is pulling <em>gold</em>fish out with a big <em>ladle</em>.	Imagine an effeminate Roman 2000 years ago<strong> angling</strong> with a <em>golden ladle</em> instead of a rod because it matches his eyes and hair better and it impresses the boys. (Why a Roman? Because 'angling' is just the roman-derived way to say 'fishing' - use this to distinguish fishing from<strong> angling</strong>.).	"<strong>Angling</strong> is not fishing (avoid <a href=""../v4/172.html"">fishing</a> (#172 漁)). It is the art of bending <em>golden ladles</em> into lures which which you catch the fish. But the fish aren't that important (and do not appear in this kanji). only the <em>golden ladle</em> matters."	I use a <em>gold</em> <em>ladle</em> when I'm<strong> angling</strong>, the golden reflection in the water draws the fish straight to it, who needs a hook and bait when you have this!		
針		needle	In frame 10 we referred ahead to this full character from which the primitive for <i>needle</i> (on the right) derives. Since we already expect that <b>needles</b> are made of <i>metal</i>, let us picture a set of solid <i>gold</i> darning <b>needles</b> to complete the kanji.		10	292	274	12	シン	はり	Remember the story of the<strong> needle</strong> in the haystack. Why would someone even look for a<strong> needle</strong> if it wasn't a GOLD<strong> NEEDLE</strong>?	A <em>golden</em><strong> needle</strong> is worth <em>ten</em> times more than an ordinary<strong> needle</strong>.	The golden<strong> needle</strong> is the true<strong> needle</strong>.	<strong>Needle</strong>s need to be metal (or they'll break).	Final fantasy reference! If you've been petrified by one of those damned monsters, get a team mate to use a golden<strong> needle</strong> on you!		
銘		inscription	Take <b>inscription</b> in the sense of the <i>name</i> you ask the jeweler to carve on a <i>gold</i> bracelet or inside a <i>gold</i> ring to identify its owner or communicate some sentimental message. It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time.		14	293	275	12	メイ		A piece of <em>metal</em> with a <em>name</em> on it. Well, this is basically the definition of<strong> inscription</strong>.	I imagine ancient Egyptian<strong> inscription</strong>s: Pharaohs' <em>names</em> written in <em>gold</em>.	The <em>gold</em> ring I gave her had an old girlfriend's <em>name</em> written inside. Here's hoping she doesn't notice the<strong> inscription</strong>.	<strong>INSCRIPTION</strong>S are done on GOLD plaques by writing your NAME on it.	If you've got some METAL and you want to put a NAME on it, you've got no choice but to use an<strong> inscription</strong> - everything else will rub off or fail to stick in the first place. (Imagine a bunch of people trying to write on metal with pencils, pens, etc. and then one guy with a Eureka moment thinking of<strong> inscription</strong>).		
鎮		tranquilize	The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of <i>metal</i> to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked. It was discovered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subconscious reactions when the <i>truth</i> was getting too close for comfort. Nowadays, people can take drugs that <b>tranquillize</b> them in such a way as to neutralize the effect of the device, which is why other means have had to be developed.		18	294	276	12	チン	しず.める、しず.まる、おさえ	<strong>Tranquilize</strong> - using a <em>metal</em> syringe to get the <em>truth</em>.	Enough <em>gold</em> can<strong> tranquilize</strong> the <em>truth</em> in anyone.	James Bond was<strong> tranquilize</strong>d by <strong>Gold</strong>finger before trying to get the <strong>truth</strong> out of him. Picture James Bond waking up on the table with the laser.	No need to<strong> tranquilize</strong>… enough <em>gold</em> will get the <em>truth</em> out of anyone.	To<strong> tranquilize</strong> your wife, you give her either <em>gold</em> or the <em>truth</em>.		
道		road-way	"The key word carries both the sense of a <b>road</b> for transit and a <b>way</b> or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the <i>neck</i> of a <i>road</i>. Think of a crowded <b>road-way</b> where traffic has come to a standstill - what we commonly refer to as a ""bottle<i>neck</i>."""		12	295	277	13	ドウ、トウ	みち	When we go out on the<strong> ROAD-WAY</strong>, we often risk our own <em>necks</em> (that's why I take the train! ).	Watch as a villianous fiend stretches a poor damsel's <em>neck</em> over a dusty <em>road</em>. Her ear pressed to the ground, she can hear the rumble of a carriage thundering down the roadway. Will the hero save her in time? Or will her <em>neck</em> be ground into the <em>road</em>, spilling it's precious contents into the dust?	"Good keyword selection by Heisig: while the primitive on the left means <em>road</em>, the whole kanji also has the meaning of <strong>way</strong>, or 'tao (teaching)'. Thus, road + way. (Check out the wikipedia article on the Chinese Philosophical concept of ""Tao"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao</a>. It's this character!)."	"I have a very abstract view for this one. Remember when the kanji for <a href=""../v4/70.html"">neck</a> (#70 首) was first introduced to us it was compared to a great moose head, cut off by it's <em>neck</em> and hung on the wall? As we all know, mooses have very long <em>necks</em>; if you imagine widening and stretching it a little you'll probably be able to picture yourself taking a stroll on the hairy '<em>neck</em>-<strong><em>road</em>-way</strong>' of the moose. It's a very abstract mnemonic, but I swear, I was not high when coming up with it!"	You're going to break your <em>neck</em> on the <strong>road way</strong>!		
導		guidance	"When we accept someone's <b>guidance</b>, we permit ourselves to be <i>glued</i> to a certain <i>road</i> or <i>way</i> of doing something, and try to ""stick"" to it."		15	296	278	13	ドウ	みちび.く	For<strong> guidance</strong> on the <em>road-way</em>, <em>glue</em> a GPS unit to your car.	Good<strong> guidance</strong> will help you stay <em>glued</em> to the right<em> path</em>.	I will glue myself to this roadway before I go to an all <strong>guy dance</strong> (guy dance =<strong> guidance</strong> :P ).	In his quest, our hero comes to a river of <em>glue</em> that he cannot cross. Desperate, he prays for<strong> guidance</strong>, and a <em>roadway</em> magically appears <em>over</em> the <em>glue</em>.	His<strong> guidance</strong> was simple: don't risk your neck, just stay glued to this road-way.		
辻		crossing	"Take the first two strokes in the sense we gave them back in frame 10, as the pictograph of a <i>cross</i>, and set it on a <i>road</i> to create a ""<b>crossing</b>."""		5	297	279	13		つじ	Cross-road.	This kanji appears in the remarkable compound, 辻斬り 【つじぎり】 (n): killing a passerby in order to test a new sword. Imagine a <em>cross</em> by the <em>road</em>, at a busy<strong> crossing</strong>, marking the spot of the unfortunate passerby's death.	A<strong> crossing</strong> is where the ROAD makes a CROSS with another road. Easy.	Why is there an extra drop on this website, but in the book there is no extra drop?	<em>Cross</em>-<em>road</em> –><strong> CROSSING</strong> The extra drop is a <em>drop of blood</em> on the road because of the many accidents that happen there. (Addition to aevangelica's story to explain the extra drop.).		
迅		swift	"Here we see a <i>crossing</i> in the form of a barbed <i>fishhook</i>, suggesting a <b>swifter</b> alternate not only to the roundabouts used in Europe but also to the ""cloverleaf"" design used on superhighways in the United States."		6	298	280	13	ジン		The car went too<strong> swift</strong>ly through the crossing and was hooked by the cops.	In the Heisig version of Frogger, you can image <em>ten</em> giant <em>fish hooks</em> sweeping across the <em>road</em>, with our hapless hero 'froggy' forced to make a<strong> swift</strong> crossing or end up as fish bait.	Indy Jones imperative: Be<strong> SWIFT</strong> at the <strong>CROSSING</strong> or you'll be <strong>HOOKED</strong>. (How many times have we seen Indy Jones defy death. But is he so quick and nimble to conquer the travails on the road through RTK?).	If you spread <em>fishguts</em> all over a <em>crossing</em>, people will definitely want to cross over it very <strong>swiftly</strong> to get away from the awful smell!	You cannot simply walk across a busy <em>crossing</em> - you must be far<strong> swift</strong>er than that to avoid being squished by the traffic. Instead, you need a piece of Link's gear - a <em>fish-hook</em>-shot, to grab onto a railing on the other side and pull you across in time.		
造		create	Think of <b>creating</b> as making something out of nothing. Then recall how the <i>way</i> of <i>revelation</i> laid out in the Bible begins with the story of how God <b>created</b> the world out of a dark and chaotic nothingness.		10	299	281	13	ゾウ	つく.る、つく.り、-づく.り	A <em>cow</em> <strong>creates</strong> a <em>road</em> by <em>eating</em> all the grass on its <em>path</em>.	CREATION is the ROAD to REVELATION (if you're feeling artsy) :).	"Creationist say that the universe was<strong> create</strong>d as it is now. This is the ""<em>way</em> of <em>revelation</em>"" or 'bullshit-do'."	Like Jack Kerouac, you<strong> create</strong> by having revelations on the road.	A revelation that comes to you on the road lets you<strong> create</strong> something brilliant.		
迫		urge	To <b>urge</b> someone to do something, you make the <i>way</i> as appealing as possible, perhaps even <i>white</i>washing it a bit.		8	300	282	13	ハク	せま.る	When you have the<strong> URGE</strong> to go to <em>White</em> Castle, you know it's time to hit the <em>road</em>.	When you start down the <strong>road</strong> of <strong>cocaine</strong>, you're sure to feel some pretty bad<strong> URGE</strong>s soon.	White lines on the road are there to<strong> urge</strong> you to stay on the correct side of the street.	If you have a unrelenting<strong> urge</strong> to pee while on the <em>highway</em>, you have to cross the <em>white</em> line and pull off into the breakdown lane.	The two paths one can take in life are the <em>white</em> <em>road</em> and the dark road. I<strong> urge</strong> you to take the <em>white</em> <em>road</em>.		
逃		escape	When <b>escaping</b> from something or someone, one always feels as if one is not going fast enough, like a <i>turtle</i> on an expressway. (Since the <i>turtle</i> is on the <i>road</i> and not on the left, it can keep its full kanji shape as given in frame 250.)		9	301	283	13	トウ	に.げる、に.がす、のが.す、のが.れる	I used my pants to make a rope, which I then used to<strong> escape</strong> from prison; hence the naked, hairy legs running along the road!	MARIO KART: When you're blasting down the <strong>road</strong> in Mario Kart, it's REALLY hard to<strong> escape</strong> from <strong>turtle shells</strong>. Especially the red and blue ones!!	"When your wifes <em>legs get hairy</em> (<a href=""../v4/235.html"">portent</a> (#235 兆)) its time to hit the <em>road</em> and<strong> escape</strong>."	A scene right out of a 30's Cartoon. A tortoise in black-white striped jailsuit is making his<strong> escape</strong> from the prison, sirens howling and lightthrowers searching the road, where the tortoise in painful s lowness walks away looking scared.	"If you used the meaning ""a person's back"" in <a href=""../v4/235.html"">portent</a> (#235 兆), you will have it easy here. Adopting Georgi87: I used my pants to make a rope, which I used then to<strong> escape</strong> from prison; which is why you can see <em>my back</em> while I run along the <em>road</em>!"		
辺		environs	To keep the <b>environs</b> clean and safe, you could cement <i>daggers</i> in the <i>road</i>, blades pointed upwards, so that no polluting traffic could pass by. You could, if you were an ecologically-minded terrorist.		5	302	284	13	ヘン	あた.り、ほと.り、-べ	"Caution: this kanji doesn't mean environment; it means ""environs; boundary; border; vicinity"". To separate the<strong> environs</strong>, create the border by placing <em>daggers</em> on the <em>road</em>."	To protect the<strong> environs</strong> around their village, samurai would travel the <em>road</em>s with their <em>swords</em>.	This kanji means area, vicinity. Such as this or that area. STORY: My mom told me not to go across the ROAD because the kids on the other side use drugs and carry KNIVES.	"Caution: this kanji doesn't mean environment; it means ""environs; boundary; border; vicinity"". To separate the<strong> environs</strong>, create the border by placing <em>daggers</em> on the <em>road</em>. Imagine cars trying to cross and having their tires popped. Stand there wagging your finger: ""This is my house!""."	Protect the<strong> environs</strong> by patrolling the <em>road</em> with your <em>dagger</em>. I tend to mistakenly put the abbreviated version of the sword primitive in this kanji.		
巡		patrol	A virtual <i>flood</i> of motorcycle police washing down a <i>road</i> is this kanji's image for a <b>patrol</b>.		6	303	285	13	ジュン	めぐ.る、めぐ.り	The cops don't<strong> PATROL</strong> anymore - they just <strong>flood</strong> the <strong>road</strong>.	The Venice cops<strong> patrol</strong> on river roads.	Crime has increased so the police have been recruiting PACMAN's to<strong> PATROL</strong> the STREETS. Here we see THREE of them<strong> PATROL</strong>LING around with their MOUTHS open.	A<strong> patrol</strong> of rescue workers arrive to help clear the <em>flood</em> in the <em>road</em>.	This should be easy. Imagine any news broadcast that shows the<strong> PATROL</strong> of police and national guard after the ROADS were FLOODED. Just to rescue the needy and stop the looters.		
車		car	You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, <b>car</b>, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them.	* <i>Car</i>, <i>cart</i>, <i>wagon</i>, and <i>vehicle</i> may all be used as primitive meanings.	7	304	286	13	シャ	くるま	My<strong> car</strong> is so fast it can go through ten rice fields in ten minutes.	Actually, this is a 10x10<strong> car</strong> that can get you through a rice field.	"Rather than hobbling along with a <em>walking stick</em> to cross through a <em>span</em>, it's much better to use a<strong> car</strong>. (Imagine an old man with a <em>walking stick</em> creeping along a <em>span</em> of road, and you, in a<strong> car</strong>, whizzing right by him. It's funny 'cause it's true.) Also, it's important to include the word ""through,"" so you know the <em>walking stick</em> goes right THROUGH the <em>span</em>."	The travelling <em>time span</em> is <em>cut in half</em> if going by<strong> car</strong>. / The<strong> car</strong> allows you to <em>cut your travelling time span by half</em>.	My<strong> car</strong> cost me the equivalent of 10 rice fields .. 10!!		
連		take along	What you are meant to <b>take along</b> in this kanji are not things but people. The image of the <i>car</i> on the <i>road</i> should ground your image for picking up your friends to <i>take</i> them <i>along</i> to wherever you are going.		10	305	287	13	レン	つら.なる、つら.ねる、つ.れる、-づ.れ	"When you put your <em>car</em> on the <em>road</em> you should always<strong> take along</strong> a few friends. Don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/303.html"">carry</a> (#303 運)."	"This kanji also means ""linked"" or ""series"" so I've changed the kanji meaning to ""GO ALONG (WITH EACH OTHER)."" Well, a ROAD and a CAR certainly GO ALONG with each other. And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD. This Kanji is the ""Union"" in Soviet Union and the ""United"" of United Nations (the countries that ""go along with each other"" at least some of the time)."	When I am on the road I always<strong> take along</strong> my car.	"The difference between <a href=""../v4/289.html"">transport</a> (#289 輸), <a href=""../v4/287.html"">take along</a> (#287 連) and <a href=""../v4/303.html"">carry</a> (#303 運)? <strong>Transport 輸 </strong>= when your car moves big items, like meat and sabers for that one butcher's hut. <strong>Take Along 連 </strong>= when you take a guest in your car on the road. <strong>Carry 運 </strong>= the luck you carry when the king's carriage is out on the road, tossing gold coins to bystanders."	[Borat] I want<strong> take along</strong> many garls in <em>pussymagnet</em> (=<em>car</em>) on my <em>road</em> back to Kazakstan.		
軌		rut	Combine the primary and secondary meanings of this keyword to form your story. Begin with the <i>car</i> whose tires get caught in a <b>rut</b> and spin without going anywhere. Then go onto the <i>baseball team</i> who can't win a game because it has fallen into a <b>rut</b> of losing.		9	306	288	13	キ		My <em>car</em> got so stuck in a<strong> rut</strong> it required <em>nine</em> people pushing to get it out again.	My <em>car</em> got so stuck in a<strong> rut</strong> it required <em>a baseball team</em> pushing to get it out again.	I got my <em>car</em> stuck in a<strong> rut</strong> ! I'm gonna have to call 999 !	"Imagine a broadcast over a police radio saying, ""<em>Car nine</em> is stuck in a<strong> rut</strong>… I repeat <em>car nine</em> stuck in<strong> rut</strong>. All units please proceed to <em>car nine</em>""."	"Hitler gets his CAR stuck in a<strong> RUT</strong>, so he yells ""Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein!!!!…"" Also, the Kanji is made up of NINE strokes."		
輸		transport	"On the left we see a <i>vehicle</i> used for <b>transport</b>. On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for <i>meeting</i>. Below it we see the elements for <i>flesh</i> and <i>saber</i>, which combine to create a compound element for a <i>butcher</i> and his trade. Together they give us the image of a ""trucker's convoy."""		16	307	289	13	ユ、シュ		The <em>car</em> is a cattle-car, used to<strong> transport</strong> animals for the <em>butcher</em>'s <em>meeting</em> - a convention on new butchering techniques. Hear the screams of the animals as it pulls up in front of the convention hall, where the butchers are waiting with their knives out front.	The vehicle<strong> transport</strong>s animals for a meeting with the butcher.	When <em>flesh</em> and <em>saber meet</em>… it's probably time to find some<strong> transport</strong> to the hospital. A <em>car</em> maybe?	In the movie Star Wars: A New Hope, Luke and Obi-Wan needed a<strong> Transport</strong> (VEHICLE) to get to Alderon. They had a (MEETING) with Han Solo.

喩	"<span style=""color: rgb(2, 2, 2); background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">喻</span>"	metaphor	People who try to sound literary often end up butchering the language. Here we see a <i>meeting</i> of <i>butchers</i> whose <i>mouths</i> are producing the <b>metaphors</b>.		12	308	3009	13	ユ	さと.す、 たと.える	<strong>Metaphor</strong>ically speaking, all the equipment in your <em>mouth</em> is basically just a <em>meeting of butchers</em>, designed to pulverize whatever meat you put in there.	"<strong>Metaphor</strong>: A good <strong>metaphor</strong> flows from the <em>mouth</em> like the <em>meeting of flesh and saber</em>, smoothly piercing the listener with its meaning. But a bad <strong>metaphor</strong> is like when you barely nick the <em>flesh</em> and only spill <em>two drops</em> of blood or when your <em>saber</em> doesn't penetrate at all but rather bends into a くく shape when you whack the <em>flesh</em>. (Note: This story incorporates both the traditional form of the kanji ( <a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%8F%A3%EF%BC%8B%E5%85%AA"">口＋兪</a> ) and the simplified form ( <a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%8F%A3%EF%BC%8B%E4%BF%9E"">口＋俞</a> )) ."

前		in front	We waited to introduce this character until now, even though the pieces have been available for some time, because it helps to reinforce the odd kanji of the last frame. Picture the <i>butcher</i> hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram's <i>horns</i> placed <b>in front</b> of him (or on his head, if you prefer). There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for <i>before</i> (Frame 263), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book.		9	309	290	13	ゼン	まえ、-まえ	When I get <em>horn</em>y my <em>flesh sword</em> sticks out<strong> in front</strong> of me.	If you stand<strong> in front</strong> of a bull's <em>horns</em>, you are asking for your <em>flesh</em> to be <em>cut</em> (or <em>butchered</em> if you prefer).	<strong>IN FRONT</strong> of the BUTCHER shop, there is a sign made of HORNS.	At the bullfight, the matador stands bravely <strong>in front</strong> of the bull's <em>horns</em>. With his <em>sword</em>, he'll dig into its <em>flesh.</em>.	The bullfighter stands<strong> IN FRONT</strong> of the <em>animal's horns</em> while he pokes its <em>flesh</em> with his <em>sword</em> to rile it up.

各		each	"""Suum cuique"" goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her <i>mouth</i> between his/her <i>walking legs</i>, giving us an image of ""To <b>each</b> his/her own."""	"* The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive; otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word ""every,"" which we shall meet later in another context."	6	311	291	13	カク	おのおの	Son, I've never told you this but<strong> each</strong> woman has a second <em>mouth</em> between their fiiiiiine <em>walking legs</em>.	<strong>Each</strong> and every one of us walks and talks differently.	<strong>Each</strong> person is gifted with a <em>mouth</em> to get us into trouble and a pair of <em>walking legs</em> to get us out!	"It's easier for me to remember a concrete object. This combination occurs often enough for me to make it a primitive element. Walking legs and mouth combine to give a ""walky talky"" or mobile phone. Imagine one of those old big ones which looked like refridgerators. Mobile phones are so popular that<strong> each</strong> of us seems to want one."	<strong>EACH</strong> of us learns first to use our <em>legs to walk</em> and then to use our <em>mouths</em> to talk.		
格		status	If you can imagine <i>trees</i> as <b>status</b> symbols (as they might well be for those living in Japan's congested cities, where greenery has become something of a luxury item), then <i>each</i> might be aiming to have his/her own <i>tree</i>, just to keep up with the Suzukis.		10	312	292	13	カク、コウ、キャク、ゴウ		"""Ranger! I want you to go check the<strong> status</strong> of each tree."" ""Errr, Each tree sir?"" replies the ranger looking out over the vast forest. ""That's Right, I want the<strong> status</strong> of each tree! Move out!""."	A man measures his own <strong>status</strong> by the size of his <em>wood</em>y…and compares it to <em>each</em> one he sees. 性格 (せいかく) : character, personality; 合格 (ごうかく) : success, passing (e.g. exam), eligibility.	I find I need a more concrete image for this. EACH TREE has it's own<strong> STATUS</strong>. For example, the Christmas Tree is holy, the Willow is of high class while the lowly Bonsai is of low class.	A person looking for <strong>status</strong> wants a <em>tree</em> of <em>each</em> kind in his garden.	(カク, コウ) In Japan, where land is so precious, <em>each tree</em> you have helps elevate your<strong> status</strong> in society. Unless you are Kumi KOUda and can actually afford to buy lots of trees, the only way you will get them is if you KAKU them.		
賂		graft	To those who believe in the inevitability of <b>graft</b> in government, everything has a price - or as this character has it, to <i>each</i> office its outlay of <i>shells</i>.		13	313	2738	13	ロ	まいな.い、まいな.う	It might sound simple to bribe someone, but then you have to<strong> graft</strong> the guy above him and the guy below him, and soon you're just giving <em>shells</em> to <em>each</em> and everyone!	When I was caught by the police doing some<strong> graft</strong> (graffiti), I gave <em>each</em> cop some <em>clams</em> and told them to be on their way. 賄賂 【わいろ】 bribe.	<em>Graft: the acquisition of money, gain, or advantage by dishonest, unfair, or illegal means, especially through the abuse of one's position or influence in politics, business, etc. .</em> <em>STORY:</em> The evil corporate extortionist<strong> graft</strong>s all who get within his power. He<strong> GRAFT</strong>s a different amount of MONEY from EACH of his victims. If they have more, he extorts more. He even plots it out on an evil graph!	"<strong>Graft</strong> is like bribing. You have to give <em>MONEY</em> to <em>EACH</em> person. There's a guy with a briefcase full of money and a walky-talky, and he's going around asking on the walky-talky about who he should give money too. ""This guy gets money? Roger.""."	I take this to mean the verb<strong> graft</strong>, and so simply see a bunch of shellfish being <strong>grafted</strong> onto <em>each</em> other, <em>each</em> to <em>each</em>.		
略		abbreviation	"<i>Each field</i> has its own <b>abbreviations</b> (chemistry, philosophy, sports, etc.). Needless to say, the ""stronger"" primitive - thatis to say, the simpler and more often used one - takes the dominant position on the left, even though the story would read them off the other way around."		11	314	293	13	リャク	ほぼ、おか.す、おさ.める、はかりごと、はか.る、はぶ.く、りゃく.す、りゃく.する	There are so many<strong> abbreviation</strong>s and acronyms nowadays that no <em>brain</em> can remember <em>each</em> of them. Mnemonic: ab-brain-each-ation.	A very anal farmer wants to catologue <em>each</em> grain of rice in his <em>rice field.</em> Imagine him scribbling a tiny <em>abbreviation</em> of his name and a number on <em>each</em> grain.	<em>Each</em> landing <em>field</em> has it's own<strong> abbreviation</strong>; e.g. BNE for Brisbane, SYD for Sydney, DRW for Darwin etc.	My <em>brain</em> cannot remember <em>each</em><strong> ABBREVIATION</strong> I see. There are just too many!!!	<em>Each field</em> has it's own<strong> abbreviation</strong> - no <em>brain</em> could remember <em>each</em> one! My <em>brain</em> can't remember <em>each</em> of the readings for this kanji! My foray into this <em>field</em> will be <strong>abbreviated</strong> if I can't <em>walk</em> the <em>talk</em>!		
客		guest	When you are a <b>guest</b> in a courteous town, <i>each house</i>hold has its own way of welcoming you, and <i>each house</i> becomes your home.		9	315	294	13	キャク、カク		<em>Each</em> person under my <em>roof</em> is treated as a<strong> guest</strong>.	In my house I welcome each<strong> guest</strong>.	Quite a rude <strong>guest</strong> walking around talking in his <em>walky talky</em> in someone else's <em>home</em>!	If you are my<strong> guest</strong>, under my ROOF you can open your WALKING LEGS and I'll put my mouth down there to please you, that's hospitality !	"<a href=""../v4/291.html"">each</a> (#291 各) is given the meaning KEITAI (Mobile Phone). I hate it when<strong> guest</strong>s answer their <strong>Keitai</strong> in my <strong>house</strong>."		
額		forehead	As Miss Manners will be the first to tell you, out of respect, one does not look straight into the eyes of one's <i>guests</i>, but focus on the top button of their collar. Here, however, you are told to look above the eyes to the <b>forehead</b> of your <i>guest</i>.		18	316	295	13	ガク	ひたい	Sign the <em>guest</em>book <em>page</em> with your <strong>forehead</strong>. (Picture a guestbook full of<strong> forehead</strong> prints like thumbprints).	In New Zealand, people welcome guests by touching their<strong> forehead</strong>s together.	Thankful <em>guests</em> bow so much, you never see their entire <em>heads</em>, just their <strong>foreheads</strong>.	The <strong>guest</strong> lowers his<strong> forehead</strong> as he turns the <strong>page</strong> in a <strong>guest</strong>book.	As a <em>guest</em> in Japan, being too tall for their standards, I have to bow my <em>head</em> every time I enter someone's house, or else I'll smack my<strong> forehead</strong>.		
夏		summer	"In the <b>summer</b>, fatigued by the heat, your <i>head</i> hangs down nearly as far as your <i>walking legs</i>, or rather, your ""dragging legs."" Note how the <i>walking legs</i> (instead of ""animal legs"") are the only thing that distinguishes this character from that for <i>page</i> (Frame 64)."		10	317	296	13	カ、ガ、ゲ	なつ	In<strong> SUMMER</strong> you are hot from the top of your <em>head</em> down to your <em>walking legs</em>.	<em>One</em> <em>drop</em> of sweat runs into my <em>eye</em>, when I go <em>walking</em> on a hot<strong> summer</strong> day.	I personally think it was too confusing to try and use <em>head</em> as the primitive. (How am I supposed to remember that the <em>animal legs</em> are replaced with <em>walking legs</em> instead of <em>human legs</em>?) Rather, I think have the image of a hot<strong> summer</strong> and you want to keep <em>oneself</em> under a <em>ceiling</em> not out <em>jogging</em> around.	"Tip:Don't use Head/Page( 頁 ) as a primitive, or it will just screw up. 頁 is used hundreds of times as primitive, and <em>always</em> needs the animal legs. Repetition makes RTK work. Little changes make life hard … The smell of sweat in<strong> Summer</strong> rises to the <em>ceiling</em>, leading you to take your 自 <em>nose</em> out on 夂<em>walking legs</em> for fresh cool air. Remember a set with 冬 <a href=""../v4/427.html"">winter</a> (#427 冬) where the sweat (<em>two drops</em> in fact), has fallen down and frozen below those same <em>walking legs</em>."	The heat of<strong> summer</strong> is so powerful, it swells your <em>head</em> so big, you need a bigger set of <em>walking legs</em> to hold it up.		
処		dispose	Both the stretching out of the <i>walking legs</i> and the little bit of <i>wind</i> tucked in on the right suggest using one's legs to kick something out of the way, or <b>dispose</b> of it.		5	318	297	13	ショ	ところ、-こ、お.る	The best way to<strong> dispose</strong> of a nasty bit of wind is to let it go and use those walking legs to dissapear. Nobody will ever know it was you.	To <strong>dispose</strong> of rubbish you should <em>walk</em> it to the bin not throw it to the <em>wind</em>.	"Contrast this with <a href=""../v4/655.html"">discard</a> (#655 捨). Disposing of something implies a degree of care, whereas discarding something is generally careless. You want to associate this with a careful way to get rid of something. You throw a piece of garbage into the <em>wind</em> to get rid of it, but remember that you should<strong> dispose</strong> of it responsibly and your walking legs carry you off to fetch it."	To <strong>dispose</strong> of something you can either kick it away with your <em>walking legs</em> or you can wait for the <em>wind</em> to blow it away.	I thought to<strong> dispose</strong> of my <em>wind</em> secretly, but it appears I 'left' a trail behind whilst <em>walking</em> away.		
条		twig	"Geppetto made <i>walking legs</i> for his little Pinocchio from two <b>twigs</b> of a <i>tree</i>, giving him a set of ""<b>twiggy</b>"" shanks."		7	319	298	13	ジョウ、チョウ、デキ	えだ、すじ	They all say they have a <em>TREE</em> between their <em>WALKING LEGS</em> but most only have a <strong>TWIG</strong>.	Don't confuse with branch or bough - think of snapping<strong> twig</strong>s. A<strong> twig</strong> is always the kind of <em>wood</em> that snaps when the hunter's <em>walking legs</em> just barely touch it, making a snapping sound that alerts the prey to the hunter's presence.	I don't believe this means<strong> twig</strong> as in a tree<strong> twig</strong>. 条 【じょう】 (n) (1) article (in document); provision; (2) stripe; streak; line. STORY: If TREES had WALKING LEGS they would march right up to congress and demand they put in a new ARTICLE into the constitution against deforestation.	(Doesn't mean<strong> twig</strong>!) I read an <strong>article</strong> in the Weekly World News about a <em>walking</em> <em>tree</em>.	I once read an <strong>ARTICLE</strong> about a guy who shoved a <strong>TREE</strong> between his <em>WALKING LEGS</em>. he was pulling out<strong> TWIG</strong>s for a long time.		
落		fall	When <i>water</i> <b>falls</b>, it splats and splashes; when <i>flower</i> petals <b>fall</b>, they float gently in the breeze. To <i>each</i> thing its own way of <b>falling</b>.		12	320	299	13	ラク	お.ちる、お.ち、お.とす	Water each flower or the petals will wither and<strong> fall</strong>.	"[It's been suggested on the forum (<a href=""http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079"">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079</a>) that <em>flower</em> across the full width of the kanji and <em>water</em> on the left below it should have its own keyword; <em>seaweed</em> is a popular choice. See also <a href=""../v4/227.html"">dilute</a> (#227 薄), <a href=""../v4/1912.html"">clan</a> (#1912 藩), <a href=""../v4/2035.html"">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻). This story is for the benefit of those using that idea.] Picture a group of Japanese skydivers <strong>fall</strong>ing through the sky – suddenly <em>each</em> one opens, instead of a parachute, an enormous sheet of nori <em>seaweed</em> to carry them safely down."	"""Flowers"" need ""water"" ""each"" day or they'll bend and<strong> fall</strong> over (helps with the order of writing)."	The <em>flowers</em><strong> FALL</strong> over the <em>water each</em> hanami season.	"""each"" is impossible to visualize, instead I picture a guy<strong> fall</strong>ing down with his mouth open in a scream and his walking legs above him flailing as he's<strong> fall</strong>ing. Works well for this kanji if you imagine him<strong> fall</strong>ing from a waterfall. At first he's holding on to some flowers, but they finally give and he tumbles into the water below."		
冗		superfluous	Picture a <i>weather vane</i> beneath a regal <i>crown</i>, spinning round and round. It is not only <b>superfluous</b> but makes a perfect ass out of the one who wears it.		4	321	300	14	ジョウ		"The king's crown was blown off by the wind. ""Oh well,"" he said, ""it's just a<strong> superfluous</strong> symbol.""."	"The court jester wears a <em>crown</em> and is full of <em>wind</em> with bad jokes. He is<strong> superfluous</strong> to the King's court. This kanji is read as ""JOU"" and commonly used to create the compound for <em>jou-dan</em> 冗談 (jest or joke) hence court jester. Also <em>jou-go</em> 冗語 (redundancy) and <em>jou-in</em> 冗員 (useless workers) 員 -<a href=""../v4/56.html"">employee</a> (#56 員)."	Trying to put a <em>crown</em> on the <em>wind</em> is like gilding the lily: entirely<strong> superfluous</strong>.	The <em>wind</em> bags who wear the <em>crown</em> are almost always<strong> SUPERFLUOUS</strong> to the governance of their countries.	Instead of just fluous, like the flow of the wind, I crown you<strong> superfluous</strong>.		
冥		Hades	"The key word in this frame refers to the underworld, the world of the dead. By way of the classic Greek association, it is also used for the ""dwarf planet"" Pluto. Since no one knows precisely when this part of the cosmos was finished, we may imagine it as the <i>crowning</i> deed of <i>day six</i> of the creation."		10	322	2841	14	メイ、ミョウ	くら.い	The beast of <strong>hades</strong> one <em>day</em> will wear a <em>crown</em>, and the number of the beast is <em>666</em>.	In<strong> Hades</strong> you have to work <em>six days</em> a week before <em>crowning</em> it with something vaguely resembling a weekend. Oh wait, that's Japan.	In <strong>Hades</strong>, as punishment, souls are forced to wear <em>crowns</em> as hot as the <em>sun</em> for <em>6</em>66 days.	If you can survive<strong> Hades</strong> for <em>six days</em> they give you a <em>crown</em> as a reward.	It's dark in<strong> Hades</strong>, for the <em>sun</em> is covered by a <em>crown</em>. Oh, yeah, and the number <em>six</em> is just a wee bit popular down there.		
軍		army	"The <i>crowned vehicle</i> depicted here is a ""<i>chariot</i>,"" symbol of an <b>army</b>."	* Used as a primitive this kanji means only <i>chariot</i>.	9	323	301	14	グン		British <strong>army</strong> <em>cars</em> are at the service of the <em>crown</em>.	Imagine a <em>crown</em> is the hood ornament on every<strong> army</strong> <em>car</em>.	"The<strong> army</strong> has <em>cars</em> that are under the command of the <em>crown</em> - in ancient days these would have been <em>chariots</em>. (NB: ""under"" to help remember placement of the primitives.)."	A <em>vehicle</em> <em>crowned</em> with a turret is a tank – and obviously a tank belongs in the<strong> army</strong>!	There is an<strong> army</strong> of taxi drivers in Japan driving the Toyota Crown model of car.		
輝		radiance	Take advantage of the first syllable of the key word to think of the <i>ray</i> of light to the left. Now add the glittering <i>chariot</i> that is emitting those <i>rays</i> and you have <b>radiance</b>.		15	324	302	14	キ	かがや.く	Rays of light emitted from Apollo's chariot =<strong> radiance</strong>. Don't put the sun into this kanji. The rays are coming from the chariot directly!	<strong>Radiance</strong> is an army of rays.	<strong>Radiance</strong> isn't just a few <em>rays</em>, but a whole <em>army</em> of them.	When I think of<strong> radiance</strong> I think of the greek god Zeus - picture him throwing <em>rays</em> of lightning (hence the extra jaggedness of the character) from atop his <em>chariot</em> riding through the heavens.	Ray's little legs joined the army - so Ray-did-a-dance (radiance).		
運		carry	"A long string of ""sweet"" <i>chariots</i> ""swinging low"" to our <i>roads</i> is a sure sign that the Lord is ""comin' for to <b>carry</b>"" someone home."		12	325	303	14	ウン	はこ.ぶ	Don’t confuse it with “take along” (287). In that one, there was a car so you could take along your friends once you found them on the road. In this one, there is an army chariot just to<strong> carry</strong> military supplies (sorry no room for you).	Roads<strong> carry</strong> armies (in contrast to seas<strong> carry</strong>ing navies or skies<strong> carry</strong>ing air forces).	"""swing low, sweet <em>chariot</em>, coming for to<strong> carry</strong> me hoooommmee."	In the past, <em>road</em>s were established mainly to<strong> carry</strong> the <em>army</em>.	"The difference between <a href=""../v4/289.html"">transport</a> (#289 輸), <a href=""../v4/287.html"">take along</a> (#287 連) and <a href=""../v4/303.html"">carry</a> (#303 運)? Transport 輸 = when your car moves big items, like meat and sabers for that one butcher's hut. Take Along 連 = when you take a guest in your car on the road.<strong> Carry</strong> 運 = the luck you<strong> carry</strong> when the king's carriage is out on the road, tossing gold coins to bystanders."		
冠		crown	By having the <b>crown</b> pass from one age to the next, a people keeps itself <i>glued</i> to its <i>beginnings</i>.		9	326	304	14	カン	かんむり	"Remember the SUPERFLUOUS<strong> CROWN</strong> that flew away in the WIND? Well now the king is saying ""i should have had the thing GLUED to my head from the BEGINNING""."	A <strong>crown</strong>, from the <em>beginning</em> of the new king's life, is <em>glued</em> to him. He must inherit it.	That<strong> crown</strong> was <strong>glued</strong> together from the <strong>beginning</strong>…I swear!	<strong>Crown</strong>ing is when the child <em>begins</em> to emerge from the vagina, covered in <em>gluey</em> mucus.	"I liked wasurenaide's story, but the superfluous and wind bits just confused me, so changed it a bit: Remember the<strong> CROWN</strong> that kept falling off the kings big shiny bald head while he's making a long speech? Well now the king is saying ""i should have had the thing GLUED to my head from the BEGINNING""."		
夢		dream	"To have a <b>dream</b> after going to bed is really the <i>crown</i> to a perfect <i>evening</i>. The <i>flower</i> petals over the <i>eyes</i> (instead of the ""sand"" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant <b>dream</b> suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji."		13	327	305	14	ム、ボウ	ゆめ、ゆめ.みる、くら.い	Last night's date with Miss Sweden was like a<strong> dream</strong>. She even laid <em>flowers</em> over my <em>eyes</em> to <em>crown</em> the perfect <em>evening</em>.	In the movie American Beauty, Kevin Spacey liked to<strong> DREAM</strong> about his daughter's friend and have a <em>rose petal</em> fall onto his <em>eye</em> from the <em>ceiling</em>. He did this lying in his bed each <em>evening</em>. You can almost see him lying in his bed in this kanji.	Sweet<strong> dream</strong>s like flowers for the eye are the crown of a perfect evening.	"In Japan, ""flowers over your eyes"" is a metaphor for falling asleep and<strong> dream</strong>ing (just as the sandman is in the West). So we can make a little poem: <em>Flowers</em> over your <em>eyes</em>, The <em>crown</em> of a perfect <em>evening</em>."	"I like to think of the sideways eye as a <em>cyclops</em>, either the monster of Greek mythology or the X-Men character. The primitive reappears in <a href=""../v4/400.html"">demolition</a> (#400 壊) and others. So: Odysseus and his mates carefully hang magical <em>flowers</em> above the evil <em>cyclops</em>. These allow them to take the monster's <em>crown</em> and escape in the <em>evening</em>, while the monster is peacefully <strong>dreaming</strong>."		
坑		pit	A <i>whirlwind</i> begins to dig its way into the <i>soil</i> like a drill until it makes a deep <b>pit</b>.		7	328	306	14	コウ		A <em>whirlwind</em> digs a hole in the ground throwing out lots of <em>dirt</em> until it ends up with a giant <strong>pit</strong>.	Tazmanian Devil whirlwinds a<strong> pit</strong> into the soil. Note: Take care difference between<strong> pit</strong> and rut.	All the <em>soil</em> was thrown to the left as the Tasmanian Devil's <em>whirlwind</em> swirled out a<strong> PIT</strong>.	Down in the earth, there's a<strong> pit</strong> where you'll find miners in top hats constantly breaking wind.	"A<strong> pit</strong> is cut into the <em>soil</em> by a magician archaeologist. He uses a <em>whirlwind</em>. (and for the primitive:) A <strong>whirlwind</strong> is made by a magician from his <em>top hat</em>, he holds it up and a ferocious <em>wind</em> whirls out of it, messing up the attire of everyone in the front row. <em>[RTK2 #221, pure group, コウ. signal primitive </em>whirlwind<em> is コウ because you will get コウght in it unless you are at the very コウ=core]</em>."		
高		tall	Recalling an image from frame 195, first see the <i>mouth</i> under the extraterrestrial's glass <i>hood</i>, and then the <i>mouth</i> under the <i>top hat</i> of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling's headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much <b>taller</b> than everyone else.	* As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of <i>tall</i> and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated to the first 5 strokes.	10	329	307	14	コウ	たか.い、たか、-だか、たか.まる、たか.める	Two little aliens in a trenchcoat and <em>top hat</em>, trying to look<strong> TALL</strong>. The bottom one, in the glass helmet, is under the coat. The top one has his top hat pulled down in disguise, so all you can see is his mouth.	Here we have TWO MOUTHS each wearing a different hat. The top one is wearing a TOP HAT which is know to be as a<strong> TALL</strong> hat. The bottom one is wearing a SPACE HELMET which is known as an EXPENSIVE hat. (this kanji means both).	Woody and Buzz-light year. Woody (in the cowboy <strong>hat</strong>) being<strong> Tall</strong>er than Buzz ( in the <strong>space helmet</strong>) both with big <em>mouths</em>. Thx Minlawc! (adjusted for clarity).	This is the classic two children trying to be<strong> tall</strong> enough to get on a fairground ride. The lower child hides under a <em>cover</em> while the upper child stands on his shoulders and talks like he's an adult. But they're still not<strong> tall</strong> enough! So the top child gets a <em>top hat</em> which j-u-s-t pokes above the 'you must be this<strong> tall</strong>' line. (and they both have hungry <em>mouths</em> for eating candyfloss once the deception is complete).	"A cowboy (here represented by a ""top hat"" revealing only his ""mouth"") looks always<strong> tall</strong> against a ninja wrapped up in his ""hood"" that reveals only his ""mouth""."		
享		receive	<i>Tall children</i> <b>receive</b> more attention. <i>Tall children</i> grow up to make better wide <b>receivers</b>. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer child psychology or American football. At any rate, be sure you have some particular <i>tall child</i> in mind, someone who really was outstanding and always attracting attention, because he or she will come in handy in the next two frames.		8	330	308	14	キョウ、コウ	う.ける	In basketball however, tall children<strong> receive</strong> all the attention.	<em>Tall children</em><strong> receive</strong> all the attention. They also make great<strong> receive</strong>rs in football… this kanji also means 'catch' (therefore a football<strong> receive</strong>r is a great image).	Kinda weird but I remember the weird ones best: A giant MOUTH wearing a TOPHAT<strong> RECEIVE</strong>S its next victim to munch on. This time its a small CHILD whimpering under the figure on the floor, scared of what is to come.	"A word of warning: With Heisig's story I keep associating this with ""attention""! I use something closer tied to the word<strong> receive</strong>: Imagine a bunch of kids finding an old radio. It's antenna is broken, so the <em>tallest</em> <em>kid</em> has to hold it up, and becomes the designated <strong>receiver</strong>."	"Usually in yaoi couples the short guy is the one who ""receives"". But here we see how the <strong>tall boy</strong> is <em>receiving</em> and he <em>enjoys it</em> ( 享楽する ）. RTK2:　キョウ 享楽主義 きょうらくしゅぎ(hedonism)."		
塾		cram school	<b>Cram schools</b> are after-hours educational institutions where kids can do concentrated preparing for their coming entrance examinations or drill what they missed during regular class hours. The exception are the <i>tall children</i> who are out on the school <i>grounds</i> practicing sports, and the <i>fat</i> ones who are out there burning off calories. So this character depicts those who do NOT go to the <b>cram schools</b>, rather than those who do.		14	331	309	14	ジュク		Welcome to our<strong> cram school</strong>: you will <em>receive</em> a <em>rounded</em> education on our <em>grounds</em>.	"""You can <em>receive</em> a well-<em>rounded</em> education if you study at our<strong> cram school</strong>"" says the advertisement. ""Just come to our school <em>grounds</em> and check it out yourself!""."	In <strong>cram schools</strong> <em>tall</em> kids treat the <em>round</em> ones like <em>dirt</em>.	<em>Tall children</em> who are well <em>round</em>ed play on the <em>ground</em>s and go to<strong> cram school</strong>.	Tall and Round kids go to<strong> Cram School</strong> on Saturday. I use Saturday instead of ground in this one since it is the first part of 土曜日 【どようび】.		
熟		mellow	The <i>tall</i> and <i>fat children</i> from the last frame are here cast into a cauldron over an <i>oven flame</i> until they have sufficiently <b>mellowed</b> that they can return to the normal life of a student.		15	332	310	14	ジュク	う.れる	Imagine <em>tall children</em> sitting <em>round</em> the <em>fire</em> toasting marsh-<strong>mellow</strong>s.	The cram school (309) tortures its students - especially the <em>tall</em> and <em>fat</em> ones who need to grow up - over a fire until they<strong> mellow</strong>. (Note that here the keyword 'mellow' only means to mature, ripen, or acquire skill; not the colloquial meaning of 'chill out').	"<strong>Mello</strong>, from Death Note, was the more <em>fiery</em> student at the <a href=""../v4/309.html"">cram school</a> (#309 塾)-like orphanage. He <em>receive</em>d a well <em>round</em>ed education there, in order to succeed L."	Even if<strong> mellow</strong>, shy children <em>receive</em> a well-<em>rounded</em> education, they too will have a chance to <em>burn</em> brightly and succeed.	Thank goodness, the <em>cram school's</em> on fire. Life is all<strong> mellow</strong> and stress-free once again, now that the stress of cram school is over with.		
亭		pavilion	Think of all the <b>pavilions</b> at County Fairs or World Expos you have wandered into or seen advertised in the media, and you will no doubt see rising up among them the towering <i>tall crowned nail</i> (the <i>crown</i> being a revolving restaurant) - that architectural monstrosity that has become a symbol of science and technology at such events.		9	333	311	14	テイ、チン		The <em>tall</em>est<strong> Pavilion</strong> <em>crowns</em> the <em>street</em>.	The Pavillion on crown street is the tallest I have ever seen.	"The upper<strong> pavilion</strong> of Tokyo Tower is very <em>tall</em>.

The king's<strong> PAVILION</strong> is easy to notice. It's the <em>TALL</em> one with a <em>CROWN</em> <strong>nailed</strong> at the entrance…	The <em>tall</em><strong> PAVILION</strong> <em>crowns</em> the <em>street</em>.		
京		capital	When we think of a <b>capital</b> city today we think of <i>tall</i> skyscrapers dwarfing the endless swarms of <i>little</i> folk scurrying here and there about their business.		8	334	312	14	キョウ、ケイ、キン	みやこ	Tokyo,<strong> capital</strong> of Japan: <em>tall</em> buildings, <em>small</em> people (compared to the buildings).	The<strong> capital</strong> is where the powerful act formal wearing <em>top hats</em>, open their <em>mouth</em>s, and get <em>little</em> done.	Both the tall and the small are found in the<strong> capital</strong>.	The<strong> capital</strong> letter in a word is the <em>tall</em> one, the one that's higher then the other <em>little</em> letters.	Kyoto ( 京都 ), the old<strong> capital</strong>: <em>tall</em> pagodas, <em>small</em> town mentality.		
涼		refreshing	Since few things are as <b>refreshing</b> on a warm day as a cool shower (the <i>water</i>), here we picture an entire <i>capital</i> city treating itself to one, and in full view of everyone.		11	335	313	14	リョウ	すず.しい、すず.む、すず.やか、うす.い、ひや.す、まことに	When you're a tourist in the <em>capital</em> during the heat of summer, finding a <em>water</em> fountain is oh, so<strong> refreshing</strong>.	The water from the capital of Japan, Tokyo, is so<strong> refreshing</strong>!	"Imagine a British guy praising his drink. ""This <em>water</em> is absolutely <em>Capital</em>! .. How<strong> refreshing</strong>!"" NOTE: This isn't intended to be disrespectful."	It is a well known fact that the most<strong> refreshing</strong> <em>water</em> of a country can be found in the <em>capital</em>.	This means<strong> REFRESHING</strong> and COOL (such as temperature). STORY: During those hot summers in the CAPITAL of Japan (Tokyo) WATER from the sky (rain) can be<strong> REFRESHING</strong> and COOL despite getting soaked.		
景		scenery	<b>Scenery</b> is depicted as a <i>sun</i> rising over a <i>capital</i> city, which is a bit of natural <b>scenery</b> the city dwellers themselves rarely get to see!		12	336	314	14	ケイ		Imaging the sun rising over the capital–classic postcard<strong> scenery</strong>.	Anyone who's been to Kyoto doesn't need to think too deeply into this Kanji! Imagine a <em>sunny</em> day in the old <em>capital</em>, and there's no better<strong> scenery</strong>.	There's no<strong> scenery</strong> quite so nice as the sun setting over China's ancient <em>capital</em>, the forbidden city.	The <em>sun</em> shining <em>over the capital</em> is a nice<strong> scenery</strong> indeed.	When the SUN rises over the CAPITAL, the<strong> SCENERY</strong> is just amazing.		
鯨		whale	The <b>whale</b> swallows a whole school of fish, who turn their new abode into a proper little <i>fish-capital</i>.		19	337	315	14	ゲイ	くじら	If <em>fish</em> were cities, the<strong> whale</strong> would surely be the <em>capital</em>.	When the <em>whale</em> was first discovered it was the biggest <em>fish</em> people had ever seen. Stories exaggerated its size - people said it was as big as the entire <em>capital</em> city!	When you're saying a<strong> whale</strong> is just a <em>fish</em>, you're making a <em>capital</em> mistake!	Remember when a<strong> whale</strong> swam up the Thames. Everyone thought there was a big <em>fish</em> in the <em>capital</em>, but it was really a<strong> whale</strong>.	"A<strong> whale</strong> is like a <a href=""../v4/171.html"">fish</a> (#171 魚) except it is as big as the <a href=""../v4/312.html"">capital</a> (#312 京)."		
舎		cottage	A <i>lidded crock</i> with an <i>umbrella</i> overhead gives us a mixture of the modern and the nostalgic in this design for a <b>cottage</b>.		8	338	316	14	シャ、セキ	やど.る	The<strong> cottage</strong> is so small - it has an umbrella for the roof; soil for the floor and room for only one mouth.	Picture a <em>lidded crock</em> full of tasty<strong> cottage</strong> cheese… yum! Now all we need is an <em>umbrella</em> over it to protect the<strong> cottage</strong> cheese from the sun.	"The homeless man stuck an <em>umbrella</em> over his <em>lidded crock</em> in the country side and declared it his<strong> cottage</strong>. It looks just like a shack (しゃ) though! Under local government legislation, after 7 years, the ""cottage"" and land were his."	I call it my<strong> cottage</strong>, but it's really just an <em>umbrella</em> over a <em>dirty hole</em> in the ground.	To further Heisig's explanation, imagine a<strong> cottage</strong> made out of a giant lidded crock and an umbrella. The mouth can also represent a door.		
周		circumference	Look more closely at your <i>lidded crock</i> and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the <b>circumference</b> of your <i>motorcycle helmet</i>: just begin at a fixed point and turn the <i>lidded crock</i> around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the <i>helmet</i>, until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your <i>lidded crock</i> made, you now know the <b>circumference</b>.	* As a primitive, this character can take the added significance of a <i>lap</i>.	8	339	317	14	シュウ	まわ.り	If my LIDDED CROCK has the same<strong> CIRCUMFERENCE</strong> as my head, I like to use it as a HELMET.	When the <em>ground</em> has an <em>opening</em> (a hole), you need to cover the entire<strong> circumference</strong> or you will fall in.	You're at a motorcycle store looking to buy a helmet. The only way to check the<strong> circumference</strong> of your head is to put increasingly larger lidded crocks on your head until one slips on just right. Now you know what size helmet to buy.	The<strong> CIRCUMFERENCE</strong> of the Earth's soil <em>surface</em> ( 土 ) has been the <em>same</em> ( 同 ) for a long time.	There's a <em>hole</em> (mouth) in the <em>ground</em>, so the men at work have put a <em>barrier tape</em> (hood) forming a circunference, to prevent people from falling into it.		
週		week	Picture a circular <i>road</i> with 7 markers on it, one for each day of the <b>week</b>. When you have walked one complete <i>lap</i> on this <i>road</i>, you shall have completed one <b>week</b>.		11	340	318	14	シュウ		Imagine a road built so well that it takes only a<strong> week</strong> to travel the circumference of the earth.	"Actually the<strong> week</strong> is like a never ending <em>road</em> where we travel in a circle through the same seven days again and again, the <em>circumference</em> is always the same. <a href=""../v4/317.html"">circumference</a> (#317 周) also means circuit or lap, so that also makes think about the rotations of the moon, sun and the earth – all important for measuring all kinds of time periods."	This city is so big, it takes a<strong> week</strong> to travel around its <em>circumference</em> by <em>road</em>.	"It takes a<strong> WEEK</strong> to walk the ""circumference"" of this ""road""."	The <em>circumference</em> of Japan would take at least a<strong> week</strong> on the <em>road</em> to navigate.		
士		gentleman	The shape of this kanji, slightly differing from that for <i>soil</i> by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted warrior standing at attention. When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan's <b>gentlemen</b>.	* The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the <i>samurai</i>, Japan's warrior class.	3	341	319	14	シ		What a handsome<strong> gentleman</strong>. Standing up so straight, and broad shoulders too!! He's like a modern samurai!	A<strong> gentleman</strong> has broad shoulders and doesn't soil himself.	The<strong> gentleman</strong> stretches his arms wide to balance so he doesn't fall onto the ground and get mixed up in it.	Gentlemen are the opposite of dirty.	A samurai<strong> gentleman</strong> starts a duel with open arms to show he has no personal grudges against the challenger.		
吉		good luck	Here we see a <i>samurai</i> standing on a street with an open <i>mouth</i>, which people walk up to and look down deep inside of for <b>good luck</b>.	* As a primitive, we shall take this shape to mean an <i>aerosol can</i>, from the <i>mouth</i> and the very tightly-fitting <i>lid</i> (note how it differs here from the <i>lidded crock</i>).	6	342	320	14	キチ、キツ	よし	The <em>samurai</em>'s wife gives him a (uhum) before battle for <strong>good luck</strong>.	"A true samurai gentleman will always mouth, ""<strong>Good luck</strong>"" to his opponents before a match."	A gentleman going into a hole =<strong> good luck</strong>. Think about it. (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).	"From the cow's mouth came a revelation. From the samurai's mouth comes just ""Good Luck!""."	"Tom Cruise - the best samurai evar - with a <strong>shoop da woop</strong> mouth saying ""GOOD LUCK"" just like that robot voice does before every mission on Star Fox 64. Then of course he fires his lazer."		
壮		robust	<b>Robust</b> is seen as a <i>turtle</i> turned <i>samurai</i>.		6	343	321	14	ソウ	さかん	The image is a<strong> robust</strong> green bulging-muscle cartoon turtle. A TMNT with hachimaki. <em>turtle</em>-<em>samurai</em>.	The Teenage Mutant Ninja <em>Turtles</em> are<strong> robust</strong> <em>gentlemen</em> aren't they?	<em>Turtle</em> samurai are more<strong> robust</strong> than regular samurai, because of their shells. (I'm trying to avoid TMNT here, because I tend to get the order of the primitives wrong. It's TURTLE SAMURAI, not Ninga Turtles).	The back of a samurai is very<strong> robust</strong>.	A <em>hairy leg</em> is a good sign that a <em>gentleman</em> (or <em>samurai</em>) is<strong> robust</strong> with plenty of testosterone.		
荘		villa	The <b>villa</b> pictured here is filled with exotic <i>flowers</i> at every turn, and has a pair of <i>turtle-samurai</i> standing before its gates.		9	344	322	14	ソウ、ショウ、チャン	ほうき、おごそ.か	A<strong> villa</strong> is fancier (decorated with <em>flowers</em>) and more <em>robust</em> than the average.	The teenage mutant samurai turtles live in a<strong> villa</strong> with flowers on the roof so that the neighbours don't get suspicious.	The<strong> villa</strong> was full of many gardens of <em>flowers</em>, and was guarded by a <em>robust</em> <em>samurai</em> with his <em>turtle</em>-shell shield.	"The beautiful <em>flowers</em> make the<strong> VILLA</strong> look quaint and beautiful, but the <em>robust</em> samurais guarding it reminds you that this kanji also means ""feudal manor.""."	The wealthy owners of the<strong> villa</strong> only plant robust flowers.		
売		sell	A <i>samurai</i>, out of a job, is going door-to-door <b>selling</b> little windup <i>crowns</i> with <i>human legs</i> that run around on the floor looking like headless monarchs.		7	345	323	14	バイ	う.る、う.れる	The <em>samurai</em> happened to find an extra large <em>crown</em> that he wore as a belt on his waist, just above his <em>legs</em>. I wonder if he will<strong> sell</strong> it to me?	"A ""samurai"" will never<strong> sell</strong> his ""crown"" (king), even it meant having both his ""human legs"" chopped off!"	The victorious samurai<strong> sell</strong>s crowns and human legs.	The <em>SAMURAI</em> was down to his last <em>CROWN</em>, so he hiked up his kimono to show off his shapely <em>LEGS</em> in an attempt to<strong> sell</strong> himself!	A samurai<strong> sell</strong>s small <em>Miss World</em> statutes. (<em>Miss World</em> = <em>crown</em>/<em>mini skirt</em> + <em>long human legs</em>; this combination appears several times).		
学		study	The <i>child</i> in the little red <i>schoolhouse</i> is there for one reason only: to <b>study</b>. Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that <b>study</b> is one thing and <i>learning</i> quite another again. In the kanji, too, the character for <i>learning </i>(Frame 616) has nothing to do with the <i>schoolhouse</i>.		8	346	324	15	ガク	まな.ぶ	In the <em>school house</em> there are <em>kids</em> always <strong>studying</strong>. (BTW, atomiton, this is NOT 字 ).	Children in schoolhouses are there to<strong> study</strong>, nothing else!!!	Imagine a schoolhouse full of thousands of children in a deadly trance<strong> study</strong>ing japanese style…repetition.	A child in a schoolhouse<strong> study</strong>ing. His brain is sparkling with knowledge!	A <em>school house</em> is a place for a <em>child</em> to<strong> study</strong>.		
覚		memorize	The idea of <b>memorizing</b> things is easily related to the <i>schoolhouse</i>; and since we have been at it for more than a hundred pages in this book, the idea that <b>memorizing</b> involves <i>seeing</i> things that are not really there should make it easy to put the two elements together.		12	347	325	15	カク	おぼ.える、さ.ます、さ.める、さと.る	In a <em>schoolhouse</em> in class: 1) you <em>see</em> something on the blackboard, then 2) you<strong> memorize</strong> it.	You'll never<strong> memorize</strong> all the kanji by <em>seeing</em> them in a <em>school house</em>. You need Heisig and RtK!	Imagine you had the ability to speed read like those people who claim they can read an entire book in like 10 minutes. Then everything you see in the schoolhouse can be<strong> memorize</strong>d instantly - you'll never have to take notes again!	When you are in the <em>schoolhouse</em> you must <strong>memorise</strong> what you <em>see</em>.	In the Heisig <em>School</em> of learning Kanji we<strong> memorize</strong> how to write the kanji by <em>seeing</em> a story in our minds.		
栄		flourish	The botanical connotations of the word <b>flourish</b> (to bud and burst into bloom, much as a <i>tree</i> does) are part of the ideal of the <i>schoolhouse</i> as well.		9	348	326	15	エイ、ヨウ	さか.える、は.え、-ば.え、は.える、え	The TREES<strong> FLOURISH</strong> in the CLASSROOM, a little too much perhaps, there's no room for the students any more.	Students are like young trees. They tend to<strong> flourish</strong> in the schoolhouse.	Within the <em>schoolhouse</em>, the <em>tree</em> of knowledge does<strong> flourish</strong>.	Knowledge can only truly<strong> flourish</strong> when it is taught openly and freely in the <em>schoolhouse</em>, and not guarded and kept secret like the forbidden <em>tree</em> of knowledge.	This is a very special <em>schoolhouse</em>, were <em>trees</em> are taught how to<strong> FLOURISH</strong>. It is important to imagine the image of <em>trees</em> sitting down and taking classes on<strong> FLOURISH</strong>ING in a <em>schoolhouse</em>. You could even use an actual <em>schoolhouse</em> to make your mental image more realistic. You would even imagine the graduation ceremony of a class of sakura flowering all at the same time while holding their diplomas.		
書		write	The sage talks rapidly with his <i>tongue wagging in his mouth</i>, while the <i>brush</i> of the scribe runs apace to <b>write</b> down the master 'swords.		10	349	327	15	ショ	か.く、-が.き、-がき	Make sure you practice <strong>writing</strong> kanji with a <em>brush</em> every <em>day</em> before the <em>sun</em> goes down.	The calligrapher had a peculiar habit: when using her <em>brush</em> to<strong> write</strong>, she would stick out her <em>tongue</em>, just slightly.	With a brush, it takes all day to<strong> write</strong> anything.	Imagine dipping a <em>brush</em> into an inkwell full of the <em>sun</em>, so that what you<strong> write</strong> can be seen at any time of day.	Rita Skeeter, from Harry Potter, has a magic brush that<strong> write</strong>s anything that comes from the tongue wagging in her mouth.		
津		haven	Seeing the tiny boats of poor mortals tossed about in a stormy sea like so many corks, the All-Merciful took its <i>brush</i> and drew little inlets of <i>water</i> where the hapless creatures might seek shelter. And so it is that we have <b>havens</b>.		9	350	328	15	シン	つ	A brush laying in dirty water is a<strong> haven</strong> for bacteria.	The<strong> haven</strong> for a BRUSH is in WATER.. Otherwise they get dry and withered and cant be used?!	A toothbrush with some water moisture kept in a nice temperature is a<strong> haven</strong> for germs.	With his <em>brush</em>, Link draws a route over the <em>water</em> to a safe<strong> haven</strong>. (phantom hourglass).	A<strong> haven</strong> is somewhere you can pull your boat out of the <em>water</em> and use a <em>brush</em> to repaint it.		
牧		breed	When it is time to <b>breed</b> new cattle, the bull is usually willing but the <i>cow</i> is often not. Thus the <i>taskmaster</i> to the right forces the <i>cow</i> into a compromising position, so to speak, so that she and her mate can <b>breed</b>.		8	351	329	15	ボク	まき	"Imagine a <em>taskmaster</em> giving a <em>cow</em> the command to ""start <strong>breed</strong>ing, and start doing it now!"", except that the cow takes his advice a bit too literally and starts chasing the taskmaster to carry out this command! instead of finding another cow to<strong> breed</strong> with. Hence, you see the <em>taskmaster</em> running to the right, trying to stay ahead of the <em>cow</em>."	Hint: This is the kanji from which <em>taskmaster</em> is derived. Actually, this kanji has nothing to do with<strong> breed</strong>, and a lot to do with <strong>pastures</strong> and <strong>shepherds</strong> (also for cowboys, japanese and spanish don't differenciate between animals). Think of a <em>cowboy</em> (taskmaster) who brings his <em>cows</em> to the <strong>pasture</strong>.	"I think of Hitler for the taskmaster primitive. This has worked really well. Hitler can be the real person (and works well for kanji such as 激 <a href=""../v4/497.html"">violent</a> (#497 激)). Or it can be more comical, such as a homosexual man dressed as Hitler for a costume party. As in, a homosexual Hitler has no hope of<strong> breed</strong>ing. (Here you imagine him wearing leather bondage bands). *Also, the taskmaster primitive seems to generally be on the right side of kanji in this book."	"Imagine a taskmaster giving a cow the command to ""start<strong> breed</strong>ing, and start doing it now!"", except that the cow takes his advice a bit too literally and starts chasing the taskmaster to carry out this command! instead of finding another cow to<strong> breed</strong> with. Hence, you see the taskmaster running to the right, trying to stay ahead of the cow."	The <em>cow</em> is forced by the <em>taskmaster</em> to<strong> breed</strong>.		
攻		aggression	The special <i>craft</i> of successful <i>taskmasters</i> is their ability to remain constantly on the <b>aggressive</b>, never allowing their underlings a moment to ponder a counter-<b>aggression</b> of their own.		7	352	330	15	コウ	せ.める	<strong>AGGRESSION</strong> is a well-honed <em>craft</em> for any decent <em>taskmaster</em>.	<strong>Aggression</strong> is the <em>craft</em> of a good <em>dominatrix</em>.	If the <em>task master</em> hits you with an <em>I-beam</em>… I'd say that's<strong> aggression</strong>!	The special <em>craft</em> on which <em>Hitler</em> relies is AGRESSION. Without it, they never would have taken Poland, France, etc.	<strong>Aggression</strong> is the craft of the taskmaster.		
敗		failure	The <i>taskmaster</i> is acknowledging the <b>failure</b> of a <i>clam</i> to make the grade in some marine school or other.		11	353	331	15	ハイ	やぶ.れる	If you end up in<strong> failure</strong>, you give money to the taskmaster to train you.	"The <em>shell</em> who was defeated before (<a href=""../v4/63.html"">defeat</a> (#63 負)) is being chastised by the <em>taskmaster</em> for his<strong> failure</strong> to win."	<strong>Failure</strong> occurs if you let money become your taskmaster.	Remember the TASKMASTER who was trying to breed a cow? With a LOBSTER in the same position, it was a terrible<strong> FAILURE</strong>.	<strong>FAILURE</strong> to <strong>pay</strong> the <strong>taskmaster</strong> will result in<strong> FAILURE</strong>!		
枚		a sheet of	English counts thin, flat objects, like bed linen and paper, in <b>sheets</b>. The kanji does this with a <i>taskmaster</i> whipping a <i>tree</i> into producing <b>sheets</b> against its will.		8	354	332	15	マイ、バイ		The <em>taskmaster</em> is a strict bathroom monitor who hands out only one<strong> sheet of</strong> really rough, splintery toilet paper per person. You can see the <em>wood</em> fibers.	This <em>taskmaster</em> is the bathroom nazi: he counts how many <strong>sheets of</strong> toilet paper and tissue you use, and then tells you what % of a tree you just killed.	"The mean <em>taskmaster</em> declared, ""You <strong>sheet</strong> on my <em>tree,</em> I keel you.""."	The taskmaster whips sheets of paper off the tree.	The poor <em>trees</em> are processed by the <em>taskmasters</em> of industry into <strong>sheets of</strong> paper.		
故		happenstance	Call it fate or providence or plain old Lady Luck, <b>happenstance</b> is the <i>oldest taskmaster</i> we know. It nearly always has its way.		9	355	333	15	コ	ゆえ、ふる.い、もと	An <em>OLD TASKMASTER</em> is no<strong> happenstance</strong> (coincidence). The older you get the more rigid in your ways.	"Need to disambiguate from <a href=""../v4/443.html"">enemy</a> (#443 敵) as it's easy to mix up <strong>antique</strong> and <strong>old</strong> here. Let's think of an accidental president – he is an <strong>old</strong> <strong>taskmaster</strong> who has managed to win the election by<strong> happenstance</strong> ."	"Only an old taskmaster uses a stupid word like ""happenstance"" instead of the many less pretentious synonyms for luck or chance."	It's not just a<strong> happenstance</strong> that the taskmaster looks old before his time.	I recently ran into my <em>old taskmaster</em> purely by<strong> happenstance</strong>.		
敬		awe	"Standing in <b>awe</b> of someone, you get self-conscious and may try to speak in <i>flowery phrases</i> out of veneration or fear. The <i>taskmaster</i> at the right is drilling you in the practice of your ""honorifics."""		12	356	334	15	ケイ、キョウ	うやま.う	The <em>flowery phrases</em> of <strong>keigo</strong> ( 敬語 ) with which you must address the <em>schoolmaster</em>.	敬 【けい】 (n) reverence; respect. 敬語 【けいご】 (n) honorific; term of respect; (P) STORY: The TASKMASTER demands RESPECT. If you don't talk to him in HONORIFICS and FLOWERY PHRASES you will be sorry.	Hitler's flowery phrases held the nation in<strong> awe</strong>.	In Japan, the culture says that one should in be<strong> awe</strong> of one's TASKMASTER, thus we are expected to use FLOWERY PHRASES when standing before them.	If you're a girl you can try to woo your <em>taskmaster</em> with <em>flower</em>y <em>phrases</em> to get an<strong> awe</strong>some grade.		
言		say	Of all the things we can do with our <i>mouths</i>, speech is the one that requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the kanji for <b>say</b> has four little sound-waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement.	* This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean <i>saying</i>, <i>speech</i>, or <i>words</i>, depending on which is most useful.	7	357	335	15	ゲン、ゴン	い.う、こと	A pictogram of someone <strong>saying</strong> a <em>four</em> letter word from their <em>mouth</em> after the censors have gotten a hold of it.	This is simple a pictogram of a <em>mouth</em><strong> SAY</strong>ing something. The lines are soundwaves. No need to complicate it.	This is such a hard one for me to remember in stories so I use Socrates to personify<strong> say</strong> since he is an orator. Just make Socrates the subject of your stories and whenever Socrates shows up you'll know this character should be written. Just picture him in his toga with a hand up in the air looking philisophical. You can try some other well spoken individual as long as they bring to mind speech, words, or<strong> say</strong>.	Before you<strong> say</strong> something in chinese, make sure you master the <em>4 tones</em> that can come out of your <em>mouth</em> so that you don't embarrass yourself.	Facciamo <strong>quattro chiacchere..</strong>.		
警		admonish	Here you have a perfect example of how an apparently impossible snarl of strokes becomes a snap to learn once you know its elements. The idea of being <b>admonished</b> for something already sets up a superior-inferior relationship between you and the person you are supposed to stand in <i>awe</i> of. While you are restricted to answering in honorifics, the superior can use straightforward and ordinary <i>words</i>.		19	358	336	15	ケイ	いまし.める	To<strong> admonish</strong> is to enforce <em>awe</em> by means of <em>words</em>.	Watch in <em>awe</em> as mom<strong> admonish</strong>es the rude clerk with <em>words</em> that you've never heard her use before.	Japanese police officers prefer to<strong> admonish</strong> perpetrators by <em>awe</em>ing them with their <em>words</em>. You've never had a talking down to, until you've been a Japanese high school student caught littering in a small Japanese town. Just imagine the talking to that kid would get! Incidentally, this kanji is the first kanji in the word for police.	"I will now<strong> admonish</strong> every person here who used WORD as a keyword in this story. There is no WORD ( 語 ) in this kanji! I know Heisig himself teaches it that way. Doesn't make it right, does it? This is about <em>SAY</em>ing something that inspires <em>AWE</em>. You will regret it when you get to <a href=""../v4/347.html"">word</a> (#347 語)! ;)… 警察 [けいさつ] <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E8%AD%A6%E5%91%8A"">、警告</a> [けいこく] warning."	To<strong> ADMONISH</strong> is to simply <em>say&amp; a lot of </em>awe*ful words (excuse the liberties taken with spelling).		
計		plot	<i>Words</i> and a meter's <i>needle</i> combine to form the sense of <b>plot</b>: to talk over plans and to calculate a course of action.		9	359	337	15	ケイ	はか.る、はか.らう	A<strong> plot</strong> is a summary of a book that can be given in <em>ten</em> <em>words</em>.	<em>Say-ten</em>'s (satan's) evil<strong> plot</strong>.	"This does NOT mean a ""summary of a book."" It means plan, project, or to measure. STORY: A TEN WORD PLAN is a very efficient PLAN."	It took only the <em>words</em> of <em>ten</em> men to<strong> plot</strong> the downfall of Caesar.	"I have only <em>ten words</em> to say about this kanji: ""Remember, remember the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and<strong> plot</strong>""."		
詮		elucidate	Think of <b>elucidating</b> as presenting something in <i>whole words</i>, as distinct from broken fragmented sentences.		13	360	2717	15	セン	せん.ずる、かい、あき.らか	<em>Words</em> that tell you the results of the <em>whole</em> story really<strong> elucidate</strong>.	<strong>Elucidate</strong> me. Tell me, in your own <em>words</em>, the <em>whole</em> story.	"Imagine a grumpy old guy wishing those darn kids would <strong>elucidate</strong> their texting <strong>discussions</strong> on their <em>cellphones</em> by writing in <em>whole</em> <em>words</em>. Of course, the kids don't even know what ""<strong>elucidate</strong>"" means…"	The <em>whole words</em> of the trendy name of the new Chinese dating service,<strong> elucidate</strong>.com, are 'electronic lucky dating service company'.	<em>Saying</em> the <em>whole</em> thing should<strong> elucidate</strong> it for me…		
獄		prison	Although we did not make note of it at the time, the kanji for <i>dog</i> is also a low-grade term for a spy. And later (Frame 1517) we will meet another association of criminals with <i>dogs</i>. The <b>prison</b> here depicts a <i>pack of wild dogs</i> (the long-timers and hardened criminals) into which the poor little c<i>hihuahua</i> (first offender) has been cast. The only thing he has to protect himself against the pack are his shrill and frightened <i>words</i>.		14	361	338	15	ゴク		The wild dog family visits their cousin in<strong> prison</strong>. They exchange words over the interphone at the visiting booth.	The only thing keeping the new <em>chihuahua</em> inmate from being 'initiated' by the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> were his quick <em>words</em> in <strong>prison</strong>.	<strong>Prison</strong> is a dog-say-dog world.	"<strong>PRISON</strong> is a place where WILD DOGS SAY ""DOG!!"" to eachother and fight like animals."	Where men talk like beasts and fight like dogs.		
訂		revise	"After completing the first draft, you <b>revise</b> it by <i>nailing</i> down your <i>words</i> and ""hammering"" them into shape."		9	362	339	15	テイ		<strong>Revise</strong>,<strong> revise</strong> and<strong> revise</strong> until you have all the words nailed down.	Remember how Martin Luther <strong>revised</strong> the <em>words</em> of the catholic church and <em>nailed</em> his 95 Theses at the door of the church in Wittenberg?	The signmaker first carves all of his <em>words</em>. He then arranges them. But he will only <em>nail</em> them into place (thus making them final) when he has had the chance to sufficiently<strong> revise</strong> the message.	You must<strong> revise</strong> your speech until you've <em>nail</em>ed it.	Keep <strong>revising</strong> your words until you have what you want to <em>say</em> really <em>nailed</em> down.		
訃		obituary	The <i>words</i> of this <b>obituary</b> work like a <i>magic wand</i>, conjuring up the desceased.		9	363	3010	15	フ	しらせ	<strong>Obituary</strong>. As a famous man lay dying, the media were already preparing the <em>words</em> of his <strong>obituary</strong> until a magician, with a wave of his <em>wand</em>, restored the man back to health.	In the Harry Potter world,<strong> obituary</strong>'s are magical. If you wave your wand over them you can hear the person's last words. Creepy!	<strong>obituary</strong>: Harry Potter's<strong> obituary</strong> was just a few <em>words</em> long: 'Guy who killed Voldemort'. He was buried with his favourite <em>magic wand</em> that he used to perform all of his <em>augury</em>.	If you know how people <em>talked</em> about someone before his death, and then read the <em>words</em> in his <strong>obituary</strong>, it seems as if by means of a <em>magic wand</em> their opinion of this person has changed over night.	Harry Potter can bring people back from the dead by reading the <em>words</em> on an <strong>obituary</strong> while waving his <em>magic wand</em> ( 訃報 ).		
討		chastise	<i>Words</i> spoken to <b>chastise</b> us stick to us like <i>glue</i> in a way no other <i>words</i> can.		10	364	340	15	トウ	う.つ	I said some bad words, and my mother<strong> chastise</strong>d me by washing my mouth out with glue instead of soap!	"In Colonial New England, people who committed adultery had <em>words</em> <em>glued</em> to them. A famous example is the ""A"" worn by Hester Prynn for committing adultery (i.e., not being chaste). In this way, <em>words</em> <em>glued</em> to you are supposed to<strong> chastise</strong> you and prevent further breaches of chastity."	If you<strong> chastise</strong> someone correctly the words will stick like glue.	I said some bad <em>words</em> and my mom <em>glue</em>d my mouth shut to<strong> chastise</strong> me.	Chastising <em>words</em> <em>stick</em> to your mind.		
訓		instruction	"The personalism connoted by the word <b>instruction</b>, as opposed to ""teaching"" or ""discipline,"" suits the picture here of <i>words</i> guiding one's progress like the gentle flowing of a <i>stream</i>. Even the etymology of the word <b>instruction</b> suggests the sense of ""pouring into""."		10	365	341	15	クン、キン	おし.える、よ.む、くん.ずる	The best type of Japanese<strong> INSTRUCTION</strong> is full immersion, which consists of going to Japan and swimming in the <em>stream</em> of <em>words</em> that surrounds you every day.	Listen carefully to the <em>words</em> of<strong> instruction</strong> before you try swimming in the <em>river</em>.	The best teachers and those we remember most are those that are most patient with us, their WORDS as gentle as a STREAM.	(technical) A <em>stream</em> of <em>words</em> (byte pairs) carries assembly <strong>instructions</strong> that are executed upon reception.	"This is the first half of the kanji combination with <a href=""../v4/129.html"">obey</a> (#129 順). Watch at the person's <em>words</em>, their <strong>instructions</strong>, turn into a <em>stream</em> which then can be put into the subjects head for them to <a href=""../v4/129.html"">obey</a> (#129 順)."		
詔		imperial edict	The <b>imperial edict</b>, spoken with the force of unquestionable law, is made up of <i>words</i> intended to <i>seduce</i> the masses - be it through fear or respect - to follow obediently.		12	366	342	15	ショウ	みことのり	"The mnemonic ""words to seduce the masses"" was just too vague and I kept forgetting it. So now instead I picture a seductive female reading aloud the<strong> imperial edict</strong> to the masses, thus ""seducing"" the masses."	The emperor did not need an <strong>imperial edict</strong>; his <em>words</em> were more than enough to <em>seduce</em> Anakin to the dark side.	The <em>WORDS</em> of an<strong> IMPERIAL EDICT</strong> are meant to <em>SEDUCE</em> the people and make them obey.	Palpatine's<strong> imperial edict</strong> is a propaganda <em>speech</em> to attempt to <em>seduce</em> the masses to the Dark Side. (If you need extra help to remember the <em>seduce</em> part, think about some sexy photos of Darth Vader being included in it as well. The resulting image should be seared into your mind forever.).	The Patriot Act is the modern day version of an<strong> imperial edict</strong>. It uses a lot of fancy <em>words</em> to <em>seduce</em> people into giving up their freedoms.		
詰		packed	"A piece of writing that is pregnant with meaning and needs to be reread several times to be understood we refer to colloquially as ""<b>packed</b>."" The character sees the <i>words</i> as sealed tightly inside an <i>aerosol can</i>."		13	367	343	15	キツ、キチ	つ.める、つ.め、-づ.め、つ.まる、つ.む	WORDS of GOOD LUCK are<strong> PACKED</strong> into fortune cookies.	Nowadays, grafitti comes pre-packaged. The factory takes a bunch of <em>words</em> and <em>aerosol cans</em> and then makes sure the words get tightly<strong> packed</strong> inside. All you have to do is spray and everything takes care of itself!	Words<strong> packed</strong> into an aerosol can: the tool of the graffiti artist.	<em>Sayings</em> of <em>good luck</em> are<strong> packed</strong> into little things like fortune cookies.	"Once the samauri had<strong> packed</strong> his things, his wife would say ""Good Luck""."		
話		tale	"That the <i>words</i> of the <i>tongue</i> should come to mean a <b>tale</b> is clear from the etymology: a <b><i>tale</i></b> is something ""talked,"" not something read from a book."		13	368	344	15	ワ	はな.す、はなし	<strong>Tale</strong>s are always spoken, not written, and because of this, <em>words</em> fly out of your <em>tongue</em>, rather than your pen.	<strong>Tale</strong>s are <em>spoken words</em>, passed on from person to person, eventually being spoken by a <em>thousand mouths</em>.	<strong>Tale</strong>s are words from the tongue.	<strong>Tale</strong>s are Told from Tongues (TTT mnemonic).	Beowulf is an epic<strong> TALE</strong> composed of <em>WORDS</em> in a foreign <em>TONGUE</em>.		
詠		recitation	Listening to the <i>words</i> of poets <b>reciting</b> their poetry is like being transported for a moment into <i>eternity</i> where the rules of everyday life have been suspended.		12	369	345	15	エイ	よ.む、うた.う	If you study some <em>words</em> for a<strong> recitation</strong>, there is a good chance they will be stuck in your memory for all <em>eternity</em>.	"Listening to the <em>words</em> in a<strong> recitation</strong> of Vogon poetry is worse than spending an <em>eternity</em> in hell. [<strong>Note:</strong> I assume those 2 reports are to warn against possible confusion with <a href=""../v4/346.html"">poem</a> (#346 詩) but how can you confuse <em>Vogon poetry</em> with an actual <em>poem</em>? Anyway, it's the next frame, so it should be easy to keep them straight… Or maybe there's a kanji for <em>Vogon</em> in RTK3?]."	"Don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/346.html"">poem</a> (#346 詩). Focus on the re- part of re-citation: making a citation of <em>words</em> over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, until <em>eternity</em>."	[for catholics only:] During the <strong>recitation</strong> of the holy rosary, the <em>words</em> feel like they will take an <em>eternity</em> to say…it takes soooo long.	For me, the keyword suggests something not as pleasant as in James's Heisig story. In my mind, a<strong> recitation</strong> is when someone reads out loud something that they have read, without the slightest bit of improvisation or impersonation, in a very monotonous, and extremely dull manner. Hence, a<strong> recitation</strong> is a long-winded <em>speech</em> that seems to go on for an <em>eternity</em> (because it's so dull and you're so bored).		
詩		poem	Since silence is treasured so highly at a <i>Buddhist temple</i> the <i>words</i> spoken there must be well-chosen. Perhaps this is why the records of the monks often read to us like <b>poems</b>. Before going on, back up a frame and make sure you have kept <b>poem</b> and <i>recitation</i> distinct in your mind.		13	370	346	15	シ	うた	A<strong> poem</strong> is a <em>temple</em> of <em>words</em>.	I'm saying this<strong> poem</strong> just for you, I built this temple from dirt and glue.	WORDS used in a TEMPLE must be very well chosen. That's why most people will speak using a<strong> poem</strong> if they are SAYING something in a TEMPLE.	A<strong> poem</strong> isn't made up of <em>words</em> that come from nowhere; they are derived after deep meditation at your local <em>Buddhist Temple</em>!	Reciting a good<strong> poem</strong> is like <em>saying</em> a prayer in the <em>temple</em> of language. 悪魔の詩 (Satanic verses). 英詩 (English poetry). 狂詩 (Kyoushi, Edo era humorous<strong> poem</strong>). 詩を作る (compose a<strong> poem</strong>). 詩才 (poetic genius). 詩想 (poetical imagination). 詩文 (poetry & prose). 詩的正義 (poetic justice).		
語		word	Whereas the character for <i>say</i> focused on the actual talking, that for <b>words</b> stresses the fact that although it is <i>I</i> who <i>say</i> them, the <b>words</b> of a language are not my own. You can see the clear distinction between <i>I</i> and <b>words</b> just by looking at the kanji.		14	371	347	15	ゴ	かた.る、かた.らう	The simplest <strong>word</strong> to <em>say</em> is <em>I</em>.	"Jesus said, ""I am the<strong> WORD</strong>.""."	May I say a<strong> word</strong> about that?	"The rap group, the <em>Five</em> <em>Mouths</em>, always go around <em>saying</em> ""word""."	<em>I</em>, the perceiving subject, need all <em>five senses</em> to learn the <strong>WORDS</strong> and <strong>language</strong> of Japanese…. holistic learning, not just rote memory work!		
読		read	In the age of advertising, most <i>words</i> we <b>read</b> are out to <i>sell</i> some product or point of view.		14	372	348	15	ドク、トク、トウ	よ.む、-よ.み	People will <em>say</em> ( 言 ) almost anything to make a <em>sale</em> ( 売 ); don't believe everything you <strong>read</strong> ( 読 ).	<strong>Read</strong> the WORDS used to SELL things.	Extra! extra!<strong> Read</strong> all about it! words for sale here.	Most of the <em>words</em> that we<strong> read</strong> are meant to <em>sell</em> something.	I'm a freelance journalists, so the <em>words</em> I <em>sell</em> are the words you <strong>read</strong>.		
調		tune	A complete <b>tune</b> is composed not only of a succession of notes but also of one <i>lap</i> of the <i>words</i> that go with it.		15	373	349	15	チョウ	しら.べる、しら.べ、ととの.う、ととの.える	To<strong> tune</strong> an old-fashioned radio, you turn the dial the full range of the <em>circumference</em>, until you can clearly hear what's being <em>said</em>.	<em>words </em> + <em> circumference</em> The most catchy <strong>tunes</strong> are <em>words</em> the go round and round the <em>circuference</em> of your head and you can't get it out of your mind.	The <em>words</em> to this catchy<strong> tune</strong> run around the <em>circumference</em> of my head.	"This kanji also means ""to investigate, check up, to search."" STORY: You ever get a<strong> TUNE</strong> stuck in your head that someone was SPEAKING earlier in the day? It runs LAPS around your head and you cannot get relief until you 調べる the song online, download it, and listen t it."	This is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends! Some people started singing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends… The words go around in a lap in this<strong> tune</strong>, in case you didn't notice…		
談		discuss	"In almost every attempt to <b>discuss</b> an issue, the fervor of one's convictions comes to the surface and creates an <i>inflammation</i> of <i>words</i> (if you will, the ""cuss"" in <b>discuss</b>)."		15	374	350	15	ダン		Think of an online <strong>discuss</strong>ion group where misunderstanding someone's <em>words</em> leads to <em>flaming</em>. An angry <strong>discuss</strong>ion = <em>inflamed</em> <em>words</em>.	Internet<strong> discuss</strong>ions often involve inflammatory words. Flame war!	<strong>Discuss</strong>ing politics on the Internet always leads to heated <em>words</em> and <em>flame</em> wars.	When people<strong> DISCUSS</strong> politics, the things they SAY often shed more HEAT than LIGHT.	I hate to<strong> DISCUSS</strong> religion or politics because people's <em>WORDS</em> always become <em>INFLAMED</em>.		
諾		consent	"The <i>words</i> of the <i>young</i> do not have legal validity unless backed up by ""parental <b>consent</b>."""		15	375	351	15	ダク		The <em>words</em> of the very <em>young</em> are useless without<strong> CONSENT</strong> from their elders.	"Delores might <em>say</em>, ""Yes!"", but she's way too <em>young</em> give any legal <strong>consent</strong>."	<strong>Consent</strong> is <em>words</em> given to the <em>young</em>.	You may get her <strong>consent</strong> if you <em>say</em> romantic things and she is too <em>young</em> to know any better.	Picture a cute loli holding flowers in her right hand, and you want to go over and talk to her, but you need parental<strong> CONSENT</strong> otherwise you will go to jail.		
諭		rebuke	"The stern tone of a <b>rebuke</b> is seen here in the image of <i>words</i> spoken at a <i>meeting</i> of <i>butchers</i> (See frame 307) waving their choppers at one another and ""cutting one another down"" as only <i>butchers</i> can."		16	376	352	15	ユ	さと.す	A PETA activist <em>speaks</em> at a <em>meeting</em> of <em>butchers</em> to<strong> rebuke</strong> them.	I imagine <em>Socrates</em> gate-crashing a <em>meeting of butchers</em> and REBUKING them: 'You've been killing things again; you have, haven't you?' while the embarrassed butchers blush and try to hide their knives behind their backs and stand in front of hanging sides of beef.	I had to SPEAK to the MEETING OF BUTCHERS and<strong> REBUKE</strong> them for mad cow disease, e-coli, and the bird flu.	To<strong> rebuke</strong> is to take what someone <em>says</em>, and <em>butcher</em> it.	諭す 【さとす】 (v5s,vt) to admonish; to persuade; to warn; to remonstrate; (P) STORY: Be careful what you SAY at the BUTCHERS MEETING because they only give you one WARNING and then you become part of a hot dog.		
式		style	"Take <b>style</b> in its sense of some fashion design or model. Then let the element <i>arrow</i> and <i>craft</i> stand for the well-known <b>style</b> of shirts known as ""<i>Arrow</i> shirts"" because of the little <i>arrow</i> sewn on each one."		6	377	353	16	シキ		Each Indian tribe crafts their arrows in a certain<strong> style</strong>..	The latest<strong> style</strong> is shirts crafted out of arrows.	To say someone has<strong> STYLE</strong> is to say they <em>craft</em> their image as sharp as an <em>arrow</em> .	Legolas mastered the CRAFT of shooting ARROWS, so shoots with<strong> style</strong>.	When you've <em>crafted</em> your look to be as sharp as an <em>arrow</em>, then you've got<strong> STYLE</strong>, baby ;o) !		
試		test	When a manufacturer produces a new <i>style</i> for the market, the first thing that is done is to run a <b>test</b> on consumers, asking them to <i>speak</i> their opinions frankly about the product. Never mind the anachronism (the kanji was there well before our capitalistic market system) if it helps you remember.		13	378	354	16	シ	こころ.みる、ため.す	In an essay<strong> test</strong>, you are judged on both your choice of <em>words</em> and your writing <em>style</em>.	The Japanese oral exam was a <strong>test</strong> of my <em>speaking</em> <em>style</em>.	Think about rap: the real<strong> test</strong> is if the <em>words</em> are as good as the <em>style</em>.	"Tip: This kanji and a few others have keywords whose meanings overlap in English which may be confusing - <a href=""../v4/354.html"">test</a> (#354 試) 試 :<strong> test</strong> (the water), try (and see), <a href=""../v4/1278.html"">exam</a> (#1278 校) 校 : examine (text), <a href=""../v4/1673.html"">examination</a> (#1673 検) 検 : examine, inspect (not a school exam or<strong> test</strong>), <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1724"">check-up</a> (#1724 診) 診 : (medical) check-up, <a href=""../v4/1980.html"">verification</a> (#1980 験) 験 : examination, experiment (similar to 試 ) ."	Your <em>speaking style</em> is NOT<strong> test</strong>ed on the JLPT (the JLPT is a little more concrete as a<strong> test</strong> for me).		
弐		II (two)	We use the Roman numeral II here to stress that this kanji is an older form of the kanji for <i>two</i>. Think of <i>two</i> arrows in a <i>quiver</i>, standing up like the numeral II.		6	379	355	16	ニ、ジ	ふた.つ、そえ	<strong>II</strong> (older form of writing 2). After shooting one arrow (the dash top left), I have 2 arrows left in my quiver (bottom left).	Once you have <em>two</em> old arrows left in your <em>quiver</em>, you better start running…!	<strong>II</strong>: To remember this Roman numeral, give each soldier <em>I quiver</em> and<strong> II</strong> <em>arrows</em>.	"For some reason i'm using the kanji for I to remember the<strong> II</strong> kanji. Its just Arrow + single stroke under the arms, there is no 'quiver' stroke, why? because you dont need a quiver to hold ONE arrow. As a result of the above explanation for the old kanji for ONE (which is never used) you need a QUIVER to hold 2 Arrows. <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BC%8C"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BC%8C</a> Thats the character for the old I incase you cant picture what im saying."	<strong>II</strong> Roman soldiers carry <em>two</em> <em>quivers.</em>.		
域		range	From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a <b>range</b> has also come to mean a grazing <i>land</i> where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming <i>fiesta</i> like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the <b>range</b>, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the <i>mouth</i> on the <i>floor</i>), and then get on with the <i>fiesta</i>.		11	380	356	16	イキ		An astronaut lands back at the launch<strong> range</strong>, kisses the <em>earth</em> beneath him with his <em>mouth</em>, then heads off to a <em>fiesta</em> to celebrate a safe flight.	"Instead of Heisig's ""Fiesta"" I use ""Spear"". Why? A spear is just a DROP extra on an Arrow. 域 ,<strong> range</strong> actually means<strong> range</strong> as in limits/boundary/border sort of<strong> range</strong>(In a box it was the old meaning for Country 國 (581). Ok way too much etymology here, but back to story. With your SPEAR standing in a HOLE on the FLOOR with SOIL to its left9as you dug some out), you can see the<strong> RANGE</strong> of the spear in attacking a possible enemy (re Diablo and other RPGs, spear's have<strong> range</strong>)."	When the <em>land</em> was within <strong>range</strong>, the pirates <em>kissed the deck</em> and had a <em>fiesta</em>.	Dora and her party must travel over the<strong> range</strong> of earth, find the mouth of a cave on the ground, and then enter within to get to the fiesta. Remember: Land, Mouth on the ground, Fiesta!	Dirty mexicans like to kiss the floor at the fiestas on the<strong> range</strong>.		
賊		burglar	From a <b>burglar's</b> point of view, a <i>fiesta</i> is an occasion to takeout the old lock picking <i>needle</i> and break into the unattended safe filled with the family <i>shells</i> (the old form of money, as we saw in frames 84 and 206).		13	381	357	16	ゾク		<strong>Burglar</strong>s… those guys!!!<strong> Burglar</strong>s only want money (clams) so that they can get needles (drugs) and party (fiesta)!	After the <em>fiesta</em>, we found out that some<strong> burglar</strong> had stolen our <em>money</em>, probably breaking in with a lockpick <em>needle</em>…	The<strong> burglar</strong> tried to steal my <em>money</em> by using a lockpicking <em>needle</em>, so I impaled him to the wall with my <em>spear</em>.	I had trouble remembering if this was during a <em>fiesta</em> or a <em>parade</em> / <em>march</em> - so I've pictured the<strong> burglar</strong> escaping from the scene of the crime in a clapped-out old Ford <em>Fiesta</em>.	The<strong> BURGLAR</strong> tried to steal my <em>CLAMS</em> so I impaled him with <em>TEN SPEARS</em>.		
栽		plantation	On a fruit <b>plantation</b> it is the <i>trees</i> that one is particularly grateful for at the time of <i>Thanksgiving</i>. Imagine yourself inviting a few representative <i>trees</i> from the fields and orchards to join you around the table to give thanks.		10	382	358	16	サイ		The<strong> plantation</strong> is where we get our Christmas trees. We pick them out at Thanksgiving to be sure we get a good one.	During <em>Thanksgiving</em>, all the <em>trees</em> on the <strong>plantation</strong> celebrate the harvest. It's a good time for them, too.	During the <em>harvest festival</em>, all the <em>trees</em> on the <strong>plantation</strong> celebrate what a good job they did producing fruit.	All <em>ten trees</em> at the<strong> plantation</strong> rebelled and destroyed their human owners. They then had a <em>festive</em> celebration for their new found freedom.	On Thanksgiving day Kunta Kinte tied to a tree being slapped because he tried to flee from the<strong> plantation</strong> while the master was distracted with dinner.		
載		load	One <b>loads</b> bales on a wagon or <i>cart</i> in preparation for the great Hay Ride that follows the <i>Thanksgiving</i> dinner each year.		13	383	359	16	サイ	の.せる、の.る	After eating a big <em>Thanksgiving</em> dinner, you have to be careful in the <em>car</em> ride home not to drop a<strong> load</strong> in your pants.	After 'Thanksgiving' dinner, my girlfriend gave me a BJ on the drive back home. I blew my 'load' and 'soiled' the 'car'. But it was<strong> LOAD</strong>S of fun! Please report this story if this makes you feel uncomfortable :).	<strong>Load</strong> the crops into the <em>wagon</em> in preparation for the <em>harvest festival</em>.	Every November I<strong> load</strong> my car with turkey, ham, sweet potatoes, dressing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, rolls. There's so much food, it sticks out the windows. I drive to my family's house for–that's right–a Thanksgiving dinner feast!	Imagine a <em>thanksgiving</em> dinner where a <em>car</em> is<strong> load</strong>ed onto the table instead of turkey.		
茂		overgrown	The sense of the key word <b>overgrown</b> is of something growing luxuriously, though not necessarily in excess - in this case a whole <i>parade</i> of weeds (outcast <i>flowers</i>). By way of exception, the <i>flowers</i> take their normal place over the enclosure.		8	384	360	16	モ	しげ.る	The <em>gay parade</em> looks astonishing, as if<strong> overgrown</strong> with <em>flowers</em>.	When your garden gets<strong> OVERGROWN</strong>, it's like the plants are mocking you. Here, you can see the roses actually parading around the yard, wilfully choking out the other, more docile plants. Then they actually go and parade down the street!	At the flower parade, (hippies' parade) all I can see is walking masses of<strong> overgrown</strong> hair!	It's important that the word<strong> overgrown</strong> leads to the elements, rather than have the elements lead to<strong> overgrown</strong> as I see too often in the other examples. So I turned one of the other stories around. STORY:<strong> OVERGROWN</strong> hair appears the most in a <em>FLOWER</em> power <em>PARADE</em> (of the hippies in the late 60's).	I use <em>scythe</em> as a primitive instead of <em>parade</em>. A <em>scythe</em> is like a <em>spear</em> (see [356]) whose tip has been bent to use for scything. When <em>flowers</em> have<strong> overgrown</strong> your front yard, use a <em>scythe</em> to cut them!		
戚		relatives	If you think of a <i>parade</i> of particularly disagreeable <b>relatives</b>, it should not be hard to imagine them as large bodies with <i>little</i> pea-brains <i>above</i>.		11	385	2882	16	ソク、セキ	いた.む、うれ.える、みうち	"Your <em>half-uncle</em> is leading a <em>parade</em> of your<strong> relatives</strong>. (Note: 上 + 小 makes up part of ""uncle"" 叔 , so I've called it ""half-uncle"".)."	"(Using the RTK1 supplement so I haven't had ""uncle"" yet.) When you take visiting<strong> relatives</strong> to a <em>parade</em>, hold the <em>little</em> ones <em>up above</em> so they can see over the crowd."	Your <em>uncle</em> organizes a <em>parade</em> of all your<strong> relatives</strong>, which he himself is only half in because he's busy taking pictures of it.	All my<strong> relatives</strong> seems to be here .They even organized a PARADE for me .Wait a minute : my UNCLE isn't here! oh I got it , I just noticed where he is but he has been forbid to scratch his crotch as usual and so I had trouble to recognize him ;.	People carry their <em>small</em><strong> relatives</strong> <em>above</em> their shoulders so they can see the parade.		
成		turn into	"Let the phrase ""<b>turn into</b>"" suggest some sort of a magical change. What happens here is that the <i>parade</i> marching down main street <b>turns into</b> a <i>dagger</i>-throwing bout between competing bands. Note how only one stroke has to be added to make the change."		6	386	361	16	セイ、ジョウ	な.る、な.す、-な.す	It only takes a single stroke of a <em>dagger</em> for a <em>parade</em> to<strong> TURN INTO</strong> a bloodbath.	The gay parade suddenly TURNED INTO a DAGGER throwing fight.	The peaceful protest parade turned into an ugly riot when some idiot pulled out a knife and started to threaten the police.	"Let us beat swords into plowshares and <strong>turn</strong> <em>daggers</em> <strong>into</strong> <em>scythes</em>. (see my story for <a href=""../v4/360.html"">overgrown</a> (#360 茂))."	The glorious socialist <em>parade</em> <strong>turns into</strong> a <em>knife</em> fight between Fidel and Raul Castro after they both give 3-hour speeches.		
城		castle	In this frame, we see a mound of <i>dirt</i> that is being <i>turned into</i> a <b>castle</b> (the way you may have done as a child playing on the beach).		9	387	362	16	ジョウ	しろ	"The sand <strong>castle</strong> is just the <a href=""../v4/150.html"">soil</a> (#150 土) that <em>turns into</em> a <strong>castle</strong>."	"""Someday this mound of <em>dirt</em> here will <em>turn into</em> our<strong> CASTLE</strong>"", the ants think to themselves when scoping out a new ant hill."	Sand sculptors can <em>turn</em> even the most ordinary <em>soil</em> <em>into</em> the most beautiful<strong> castle</strong>s.	A <strong>castle</strong> is just <em>land</em> that has been <em>turned into</em> something else: stone walls, a keep, armouries, barracks, etc. 城下 (じょうか) : land near the<strong> castle</strong>; 城 (しろ) :<strong> castle</strong>.	A<strong> castle</strong> is built on the ground where a parade was turned into a bloodbath.		
誠		sincerity	The sure sign of <b>sincerity</b> is that one's mere <i>words</i> are <i>turned into</i> deeds.		13	388	363	16	セイ	まこと	<strong>Sincerity</strong> happens when what you <em>say</em> actually <em>turns into</em> something.	<strong>Sincerity</strong> is <em>turn</em>ing your <em>word</em>s into actions.	<em>Words</em> <em>turning into</em> actions is a sign of true <strong>sincerity</strong> . You do what you say (せい) you will. Marco and (まこと) his Brazilian friends need to learn this - they say they won't smoke pot inside anymore, but still do it – that's not being very <strong>sincere</strong>.	When your <em>words</em> <em>turn into</em> something of true meaning, that is<strong> sincerity</strong>. [Not sure why this was reported twice… 'words' is perfectly OK here….].	"Socrates said "" If said with<strong> sincerity</strong>, words can turn in to anything"". Very similar to ""castle"", #362."		
威		intimidate	Here we see a <i>march</i> of <i>women</i> demonstrating on behalf of equal rights, something extremely <b>intimidating</b> to the male chauvinist population.		9	389	364	16	イ	おど.す、おど.し、おど.かす	The <em>march</em> of <em>women</em> - against <em>intimidation</em> in the workplace - is pretty <em>intimidating</em> in itself!	"Interesting that this kanji also has the meanings of ""dignity"" and ""threaten."" I can see how a <em>march</em> of <em>women</em> in Japan would be seen as <em>intimidating</em> by most men."	A <em>one woman</em> <em>parade</em>? How is that supposed to<strong> intimidate</strong> me?	I use <em>Grim Reaper</em> instead of <em>march</em> for the primitive, because he's the <em>one</em> holding the <em>scythe</em> (see [360]). Now imagine a female Grim Reaper - that's even more <strong>intimidating</strong>!	A group of feminist WOMEN are MARCHING for their rights, theyre so ugly it's INTIMIDATING.		
滅		destroy	Picture a <i>march</i> of <i>flames</i> demonstrating against the Fire Department for their right to <b>destroy</b>, but being doused with <i>water</i> by the police riot squads.		13	390	365	16	メツ	ほろ.びる、ほろ.ぶ、ほろ.ぼす	Water flows down to<strong> destroy</strong> the march of fire.	"Use a <em>water</em> cannon to<strong> destroy</strong> a line of <em>march</em>ing <em>fire</em> monsters. I keep mixing this one up with <a href=""../v4/167.html"">disaster</a> (#167 災) and <a href=""../v4/400.html"">demolition</a> (#400 壊). Remember, you<strong> DESTROY</strong> monsters (think of the Godzilla movie ""Destroy All Monsters!""). Fires and floods are natural DISASTERs. And DEMOLITION is something you carefully do while wearing protective garments. (vaguely based on stefanot's balrog story)."	Lord of the Rings: Orcs, all carrying <em>torches</em> (in the night, for visuals) and intent on <em>destroying</em> everything in their path, are utterly<strong> destroy</strong>ed by the releasing of the waters (by the Ents).	Use <em>water</em> to prevent the <em>march</em> of the <em>fire</em> before it<strong> destroy</strong>s everything.	"I mix this up with 壊 demolition (#400 壊) alll the time, so i need to say: the MARCH to<strong> destroy</strong> TROY (the ancient city). TROY which comes from<strong> desTROY</strong>! They came across the WATER with the horse, secretly MARCHED in the city and BURNED the city down.<strong> DESTROY</strong>: The march of flames on troy. . . 絶滅 ぜつめつ　－　Extinction RTK2:　メツ 滅亡 めつぼう(destruction) 滅ぶ ほろぶ　－　To collapse, go under, be<strong> destroy</strong>ed.　."		
減		dwindle	A group of unquenchable <i>mouths</i> sets out on a <i>march</i> across the country, drinking <i>water</i> wherever they find it until the <i>water</i> supply has <b>dwindled</b> to a trickle, triggering a national disaster.		12	391	366	16	ゲン	へ.る、へ.らす	When WATER was tossed on the PROTESTORS (a march of mouths), the numbers began to<strong> DWINDLE</strong>.	When water supplies<strong> dwindle</strong>d, the population became a horde of dry <em>mouths</em>, <em>marching</em> to seize the water in the neighboring kingdom.	When <em>water</em> supplies<strong> dwindle</strong>d, <em>one</em> <em>mouth</em> raised a cry and led a <em>march</em> on the city!	As the <em>water</em> supply<strong> dwindle</strong>s, the <em>Grim Reaper</em> (see [364]) looms over the thirsty <em>mouths</em>.	The water<strong> dwindle</strong>s as the parade of thirsty mouths goes by.		
蔑		revile	The verbal abuse involved in <b>reviling</b> those who do not deserve it can be compared to a <i>march of flowers</i> in full boom having an <i>eyeball</i> of nastiness cast over them (literally, of course).		14	392	2390	16	ベツ	ないがしろ、なみ.する、くらい、さげす.む	They gays were <strong>reviled</strong> by society, so they put <em>flowers</em> above their <em>eyes</em> and <em>marched</em> around.	"Note: Whether you see a ""drop"" or a ""one"" in the bottom left of 蔑 depends on the font your computer is using at the time. Newer fonts prefer the ""one""."	The <em>gay pride parade</em> (flowers + march) was going smoothly until it caught the <em>eye</em> of the religious right, who<strong> revile</strong>d the demonstration so much that they tried to interrupt it.	Flower, eye, march: After the Trojans had defeated the cyclops, they planted <em>flowers</em> in his only <em>eye</em> (blinding him) and then <em>marched</em> him back to Troy to be marched around and <strong>reviled</strong> by the citizens.	In Northern Ireland, bitter religious groups<strong> revile</strong> their opponents by <em>marching</em> defiantly under their very <em>eye</em>, holding <em>flowers</em> that symbolize their beliefs.		
桟		scaffold	Prior to the use of metal, <i>trees</i> were once cut down and bound together for use as <b>scaffolding</b> material. In the case of this kanji, what is being constructed is not a skyscraper but a simple <i>float</i>.		10	393	367	16	サン、セン	かけはし	"Japanese festival <em>floats</em> are often so tall they need <em>wood</em> <strong>scaffolds</strong> to be completed. (<a href=""http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html"">http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html</a>)."	You need a<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong> made of WOOD to build a FLOAT if it will be several stories high.	"HINT: Near as I can tell from the Zhongwen site, the figure that Heisig designates as a ""float"", actually means ""lances broken into pieces"" (though there's a third stroke in the Japanese version of the kanji rather than two in the Chinese), thus I'm using <em>broken into pieces</em> to identify that particular pictograph. STORY: A<strong> scaffold</strong> is made of <em>WOOD BROKEN INTO PIECES</em>."	Not using Heisigs float. im extending the meaning of my Spear (see previous kanji).Think a VERY LONG SPEAR/TRIDENT (Trident as this is like an ARROW with 3 spikes) or, a LONG SPEAR because its just a SPEAR with TWO extra arrow lengths. STORY:<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong>s' are made of VERY LONG SPEARS's as tall as TREES that allow us to build huge structures.Tridents allow TRIPLE interlocking between each other, making their use in<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong>S good enough to be able to build structures as strong and naturally perfect as TREES.	A<strong> scaffold</strong> is where you hang witches. In order to know whether they're witches or not, you put them on a scale to see whether they whether they weigh more than <strong>wood</strong>, a duck, or other things that <strong>float</strong>, like very small rocks. (Monty Python: Search for the Holy Grail).		
銭		coin	Those special <i>gold</i>-colored tokens minted each year for the Mardi Gras and thrown into the crowds from people on the <i>floats</i> give us the kanji for <b>coins</b>.		14	394	368	16	セン、ゼン	ぜに、すき	"Interesting fact: The Japanese one yen<strong> coin</strong> is the only<strong> coin</strong> in the world that can float on water. <a href=""http://www.hanamiweb.com/floatingyen.jpg"">http://www.hanamiweb.com/floatingyen.jpg</a>."	Political hopefuls in Rome threw gold<strong> COIN</strong>S from floats when they were campaigning for office.	Gold<strong> coin</strong>s will not float.	Think of the gold<strong> coin</strong>s floating in Super Mario games.	Picture a large golden float…you know, made of gold. Every year when they bring this float out there are people waiting at the sides of the float to take their<strong> coin</strong> shaped hole punchers and punch out some very valuable gold<strong> coin</strong>s.		
浅		shallow	An entourage of <i>floats</i> going from one town to the next must always seek a <b>shallow</b> place to cross the <i>water</i>. Try to picture what happens if they don't.		9	395	369	16	セン	あさ.い	The <em>water</em> can't be too<strong> SHALLOW</strong> if you expect to <em>float</em>.	"The water isn't <strong>shallow</strong> enough to <a href=""../v4/372.html"">ford</a> (#372 渉). We'll have to cross by <em>float</em>!"	The water is too<strong> SHALLOW</strong> to float in it.	A <em>parade float</em> full of devout Christians is attempting to recreate Jesus' walking on <em>water</em> phenomenon. They claim to be able to do it because of faith, but only reason they are managing to do it is because the water is<strong> shallow</strong>.	When you encounter water and can't find a<strong> shallow</strong> spot while driving a float, you will find out if it can float!		
止		stop	The character for <b>stop</b> is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it. Take it as a rather crude drawing of a footprint: the first 3 strokes represent the front of the foot and the last the heel. The big toe (stroke 2 sticking out to the right) on the right indicates that this is a left foot.	* Although the meaning of <i>stop</i> will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of <i>footprint</i>.	4	396	370	17	シ	と.まる、-ど.まり、と.める、-と.める、-ど.め、とど.める、とど.め、とど.まる、や.める、や.む、-や.む、よ.す、-さ.す、-さ.し	If you find in the <em>ground</em> a <em>walking stick</em> with a <em>magic wand</em>,<strong> STOP</strong>! Maybe it's some kind of macumba/black magic/voodoo bad thing.	This looks like a little police officer sticking his hand out (first two strokes) signaling for cars to<strong> stop</strong> as a schoolboy/girl is following behind (third stroke). The final stroke is the road.	If you don't remember this one from the 10,000,000<strong> STOP</strong> signs on roads all over Japan, you're beyyond help!	<strong>STOP</strong>! I put my foot down.	"Gandalf took his <em>magic wand</em>, which looked like an old <em>walking stick</em>, and stuck it in the <em>ground</em>, before bellowing, ""<strong> STOP</strong>! YOU SHALL NOT PASS!""."		
歩		walk	<i>Footprints</i> that follow one another a <i>few</i> at a time indicate <b>walking</b>.		8	397	371	17	ホ、ブ、フ	ある.く、あゆ.む	When<strong> walk</strong>ing your pet, you must <em>stop </em>a<em> few</em> times along the way when nature calls.	When you learn to<strong> walk</strong>, you take your <em>steps</em> a <em>few</em> at a time. Picture a clumsy but happy toddler who falls every <em>few</em> <em>steps</em> but keeps getting up to try again.	When you take a<strong> walk</strong> you should <em>stop</em> a <em>few</em> times to smell the roses.	When you<strong> walk</strong> you leave a <em>few</em> <em>footprints</em>.. not as many as when you run.	To <strong>walk</strong> is to <em>stop</em> a <em>little</em> now and then while going somewhere. (not exactly true, but that made it stick for me!).		
渉		ford	To <b>ford</b> a body of <i>water</i> means to <i>walk</i> across it.		11	398	372	17	ショウ	わた.る	The new<strong> Ford</strong> Jesus. It can do everything except WALK on WATER.	A<strong> ford</strong> is a place where one can walk through the water, a place only a few footsteps deep.	<strong>Ford</strong>ing is simply walking through water.	"Did you hear about the new<strong> ford</strong> model out? They're calling it the ""Jesusmobile"" – It's able to <em>walk</em> across <em>water</em>!"	The new<strong> Ford</strong> Jesus. It can WALK on WATER. (edit on ngoli1. I think negations make stories hard).		
頻		repeatedly	The image of something occurring <b>repeatedly</b>, over and over again, is of having one's <i>head walked</i> on.		17	399	373	17	ヒン	しき.りに	I<strong> repeatedly</strong> <em>walk</em> around hoping this kanji will come into my <em>head</em>. I<strong> repeatedly</strong> <em>walk</em> around hoping this kanji will come into my <em>head</em>. I<strong> repeatedly</strong> <em>walk</em> around hoping this kanji will come into my <em>head</em>. I<strong> repeatedly</strong> <em>walk</em> around hoping this kanji will come into my <em>head</em>. I<strong> repeatedly</strong> <em>walk</em> around hoping this kanji will come into my <em>head</em>.	"Are you familiar with the joke about the ditzy secretary who<strong> repeatedly</strong> <em>walked</em> back and forth forcibly over all the <em>pages</em> of her boss' most important letters. When confronted she just says ""Well you said they needed to be stamped before they're mailed.""."	"FACT: Saddam Hussein put a mosaic of Bush on the floor of the Al Rashid hotel so as people would be forced to<strong> repeatedly</strong> <em>walk</em> on his <em>head</em>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Rashid_Hotel"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Rashid_Hotel</a>."	Notice a pigeon how it <em>walks</em>. Its <em>head</em> bobs up and down<strong> repeatedly</strong>.	“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stomping [<em>walking</em>] on a human face [<em>head</em>] – forever [repeatedly].” – George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four.		
肯		agreement	Seeing <i>footprints</i> on someone's <i>flesh</i> indicates a rather brutal way of having secured that person's <b>agreement</b>.		8	400	374	17	コウ	がえんじ.る	A secret<strong> agreement</strong> between a covert gov't agency and aliens states that we will not step <em>foot</em> on the <em>moon</em> again in return for alien technology.	NASA and Armstrong made an<strong> agreement</strong>: They'd never tell anyone that no-one actually stepped <em>foot</em> on the <em>moon</em>.	The peace<strong> agreement</strong> put a <em>stop</em> on the fighting for a <em>month</em>.	Neil Armstrong had an<strong> agreement</strong> with NASA: I will be the first one to leave a FOOTPRINT on the MOON. REMEMBER the position: the FOOTPRINT is over the MOON.	Vegetarians are in<strong> agreement</strong> about stopping the flesh trade.		
企		undertake	To <b>undertake</b> a project is to take some idea floating in the air and <i>stop</i> it so that it can be brought down to earth and become a reality. Here we see some <b>undertaking</b> made to <i>stop</i> under a beach <i>umbrella</i>.		6	401	375	17	キ	くわだ.てる、たくら.む	Mary Poppins floated down with her <em>umbrella</em> to<strong> undertake</strong> the job of <em>stop</em>ping the children's misbehaving.	In Resident Evil, you<strong> UNDERTAKE</strong> a mission to STOP UMBRELLA from infecting the country with the T-Virus.	The<strong> Undertake</strong>r is an evil WWE wrestler - he beat his opponent with an <em>umbrella</em> until he stopped <em>moving</em>.	I will<strong> UNDERTAKE</strong> this project: To sell UMBRELLAS in a bus STOP.	Think of a crowd of people, standing under their <em>umbrellas</em> at a funeral in the pouring rain, honoring a friend/relative whose life has <em>stopped</em>. For extra reinforcement think of<strong> undertake</strong> as coming from<strong> undertake</strong>r.		
歴		curriculum	That same <i>grove of trees</i> we met in frame 226 shows up here in the character for <b>curriculum</b> (in the sense of a record of one's life or academic achievements, the <b>curriculum</b> vitae). Instead of the <i>grove</i> making its way slowly through the surface of the <i>cliff</i> as before, here we see it <i>stopped</i>, much the same as a <b>curriculum</b> vitae calls a halt to the calendar and talks only about the past.		14	402	376	17	レキ、レッキ		A<strong> CURRICULUM</strong> is a <em>calendar</em> that replaces days with reasons to <em>stop</em> having fun.	A little like a <em>calendar</em>, your <strong>CV</strong> records your <em>footsteps</em> through time.	"A<strong> curriculum</strong> (vitae) is similar to a <em>calendar</em> except that, instead of mentioning every <em>day</em> in your life, it only mentions the main <em>stop</em>s. (Compare <a href=""../v4/213.html"">calendar</a> (#213 暦))."	Stop underneath a grove of trees by the cliffs to sit down and write your CV.	When the school<strong> CURRICULUM</strong> started covering TREES that grow in cliffs, I decided to STOP attending.		
武		warrior	With a <i>quiver</i> of <i>arrows</i> set on one's back, the goal of the <b>warrior</b> depicted here is not to attack but merely to <i>stop</i> the attack of others: the oldest excuse in history!		8	403	377	17	ブ、ム	たけ.し	ONE-ARROW can STOP a<strong> warrior</strong>.	A great<strong> warrior</strong> can <em>stop</em> any 0pponent with <em>one arrow</em>.	The traditional<strong> warrior</strong> carries a quiver of ARROWS. But the<strong> warrior</strong> must never forget his real purpose: to STOP conflict, not cause it.	"Remember the story of ""Achilles the<strong> Warrior</strong>,"" who was put down by <em>one</em> <em>arrow</em> (the drop in the quiver) among many <em>quivers</em> which hit just above his <em>foot</em>."	<em>Lord of the Rings:</em> It took a <em>quiver</em> of arrows to <em>stop</em> the <strong>warrior</strong> Boromir in Fellowship of the Ring.		
賦		levy	A certain portion of <i>shells</i> (money) is collected by the <i>warrior</i> from the local villages as he passes through to defray the costs of keeping the land safe, and this is called a <b>levy</b>.		15	404	378	17	フ、ブ		A <em>warrior</em> stands guard at a bridge collecting <em>shells</em> as a <strong>levy</strong> for any who want to pass.	"""Drove my Chevy to the<strong> levy</strong> but the<strong> levy</strong> was dry. And those good old warrior boys, drinking whiskey and rye, said pay up the clams or you'll die. Pay up the clams or you'll die…""."	A<strong> levy</strong> is <em>money</em> collected to fund kingdom's <em>warriors</em>.	"""Gimme some <em>clams</em>"" said the <em>warrior,</em> collecting his <strong>levy.</strong>."	Bush always used the excuse that the <em>money</em> from the Iraq<strong> levy</strong> was to support America's <em>warriors</em> overseas.		
正		correct	"""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,"" says the Chinese proverb. Here we see <i>one footprint</i>, complementing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not made <b>correctly</b>, the whole point of the journey will be forfeited. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in <b>correcting</b> their students, and parents in <b>correcting</b> their children."		5	405	379	17	セイ、ショウ	ただ.しい、ただ.す、まさ、まさ.に	If you do it<strong> correct</strong> on the <em>first</em> attempt you can <em>stop</em>.	My (Japanese) wife tells me that Japanese people use this kanji to tally up numbers (instead of 4 vertical lines and a diagonal across). I remember this one by writing the kanji while counting out the strokes to myself and saying this is the<strong> correct</strong> way to tally numbers.	The<strong> correct</strong> way of learning Japanese? <em>First</em>, <em>stop</em> everything you're doing. Then, go pick up a copy of Heisig's book and work from there.	The<strong> correct</strong> way to tackle any problem is <em>one</em> <em>step</em> at a time.	You want a<strong> correct</strong> answer in one stop? Google is your friend…		
証		evidence	"<i>Words</i> that testify to the <i>correctness</i> of some fact are classified as <b>evidence</b>. (Here we see a good example of how the more common primitive element takes the ""strong"" position to the left, even though it has more strokes.)"		12	406	380	17	ショウ	あかし	Your words must be absolutely correct if you plan to use them as<strong> evidence</strong>.	"""If what you <em>say</em> is indeed <em>correct</em>, we could use use your testimony as<strong> evidence</strong>""."	The<strong> evidence</strong> you find at the crime scene is misspelled WORDS scrawled everywhere– think of Se7en. But you can't resist, and you have to CORRECT their spelling.	<strong>Evidence</strong> proves that your words are correct.	"<strong>Evidence</strong> proves that what you <a href=""../v4/335.html"">say</a> (#335 言) is <a href=""../v4/379.html"">correct</a> (#379 正)."		
政		politics	To the many definitions for <b>politics</b> that already exist, this character offers yet another: <i>correct taskmastering</i>. Think about what the primitives tell us. On the one hand, we see the pessimistic wisdom that <b>politics</b> has to do with <i>taskmastering</i>, maneuvering people with or without their will. And on the other, we see the campaign assurances that this duty can be performed <i>correctly</i> if only the right candidate is given a chance.		9	407	381	17	セイ、ショウ	まつりごと、まん	Those involved in<strong> politics</strong> are always trying to elect the <em>correct</em> <em>taskmaster</em>.	Insane political <em>correctness</em> on the left, and facists <em>taskmasters</em> on the right- thats<strong> politics</strong> in a nutshell right there.	The Left is careful to be politically correct in speech. The Right whips people into a frenzy of outrage!	Insane political <em>correctness</em> on the left, and a fascist <em>Hitler</em> on the right – thats<strong> politics</strong> in a nutshell right there.	"I like immacolata's ""chief whip"" (helps if you are British!) as <em>taskmaster</em>. But let us not forget <strong>policital</strong> <em>correct</em>ness. The <em>taskmaster</em> (chief whip) is there to see that party members observe <strong>political</strong> <em>correct</em>ness at all times, especially in a socialist party, <em>correct</em>ness is on the left!"		
定		determine	<b>Determination</b>, in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to <i>mending</i> one's <i>house</i>.		8	408	382	17	テイ、ジョウ	さだ.める、さだ.まる、さだ.か	In The Karate Kid, the boy must prove his determination by MENDING his teacher's HOUSE in various ways.	Prior to buying a home, the <em>home</em> inspector will come into your house and<strong> determine</strong> everything that needs <em>mending</em>.	"People who decide to renovate (ooh, that's a fancy word, let's say <em>""mend""</em>) their <em>houses</em> must be very<strong> determine</strong>d DIYers. (Using DIY helps me remember this story when I see<strong> DEtermine</strong>)."	"定める 【さだめる】 (v1,vt) to decide; to establish; to<strong> determine</strong>; (P)The primitive ""mend"" is too arbitrary and I can never remember it. New primitive meaning: CORRECT PERSON: Do you see the 4th and 5th stroke? They look like the kanji for ""person."" Therefore, CORRECT + PERSON = CORRECT PERSON. STORY: I DECIDED/DETERMINED I would fix my HOUSE this summer but am still looking for the CORRECT PERSON to do it (i.e. a contractor)."	"The Determinator Arnold Schwarzenegger has <strong>determined</strong> to get out the ladder and the tools and start <em>mending</em> the <em>roof.</em> ""I'll be back - after mending the roof,"" he utters dramatically."		
錠		lock	<i>Metal</i> of itself doesn't <b>lock</b>. It needs to be so <i>determined</i> by a <b>lock</b>smith. Now make a concrete image of that.		16	409	383	17	ジョウ		Even if you<strong> lock</strong> up your GOLD, a DETERMINED thief will get it in the end.	The best stories for this kanji tend to have a thief in them, which always makes me confuse them with the kanji for burglar (357). So, let's try this one: My girlfriend wears a <em>metal</em> chastity belt with a <strong>lock</strong> but I am <em>determined</em> to open it! I must get inside!	A<strong> LOCK</strong> is <em>metal</em> that is <em>determined</em> to keep intruders out.	A<strong> lock</strong> is a piece of <em>metal</em> that will <em>determine</em> who can or can't get in.	A METAL<strong> LOCK</strong> DETERMINES who can get in.		
走		run	<b>Running</b>, we are told here, <i>mends</i> the <i>soil</i>. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for <i>road</i> does; and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened.		7	410	384	17	ソウ	はし.る	Hint: This kanji is NOT <em>soil</em> on top of <em>mend</em>, as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is <em>10</em> on top of <em>mend</em>. So my story is: If you<strong> run</strong> <em>10</em> miles, you will need to <em>mend</em> your socks!	The sports ground needs MENDING after the game as the players have been<strong> RUN</strong>NING around which has caused the ground to be chopped up.	The <em>soil</em> needs <em>mending</em> after the cross-country<strong> run</strong>.	If you<strong> run</strong> <em>10</em> miles you'll need to <em>mend</em> your socks.	With ten things to mend, you've got to<strong> run</strong> to get it all done.		
超		transcend	When one is <i>running</i> after something, the goal that <i>seduces</i> one is said to <b>transcend</b> the seeker.		12	411	385	17	チョウ	こ.える、こ.す	A successful marathon runner needs to be able to<strong> transcend</strong> seductions, such as the possibility of rest, shelter from the rain, or a cold beer.	To<strong> transcend</strong> to a higher path you need to <em>run</em> from the <em>seduction</em> of earthly desires.	To<strong> transcend</strong> oneself is to reach a higher plane of reality. A head shaven monk is telling me this. We are in a Tibetan monastery. He was once an athlete, a runner. He used to run everywhere, until one day, he saw a beautiful cheerleader along his path. She tried very hard to seduce him, but he forced himself to<strong> transcend</strong> his urges. He did reach his running goal, and he has became a lonely monk. He wishes now he had just broken down back then and….	Pamela Anderson was able to<strong> transcend</strong> the Television world and become a superstar after her years of <em>seductive running</em> on the beaches of Baywatch.	To<strong> transcend</strong> life you must run from anything that seduces you.		
赴		proceed	In <b>proceeding</b> to a new city or a new job, something in you <i>runs</i> ahead with excitement, and something else holds you back, like a <i>divining rod</i> built into your psyche warning you to check things out carefully before rushing in too wildly.		9	412	386	17	フ	おもむ.く	"""Don't <em>run</em> into trouble,"" Dumbledore tells Harry. ""<strong>Proceed</strong> with caution with your <em>wand</em> out.""."	"You go through airport security. ""Proceed,"" mumbles the guard after he wands you. You run like crazy, because you're late for your flight."	While running, my magic wand tells me where to<strong> proceed</strong>.	I've got to run and take a piss before<strong> proceed</strong>ing.	In a relay race, the baton (<em>wand</em>) must<strong> proceed</strong> from one <em>runner</em> to the next.		
越		surpass	"Here we see two <i>parades</i> in competition, each trying to <b>surpass</b> the other by <i>running</i> at high speed from one town to the next. Note the little ""hook"" at the end of the first stroke of the element for <i>parade</i>. This is the ONLY time it appears like this in the kanji treated in this book."		12	413	387	17	エツ、オツ	こ.す、-こ.す、-ご.し、こ.える、-ご.え	The person in charge of <em>running</em> the <em>parade</em><strong> surpass</strong>ed all our expectations (by just a extra drop…).	The <em>parade</em> of <em>runners</em> are all trying to<strong> SURPASS</strong> each other - and they end up running all the way to <em>Vietnam</em> (note that this kanji is also used for the country of Vietnam).	A RUNNER will always<strong> SURPASS</strong> a PARADE.	"This kanji is read the same way as # 385 ""transcend."" The difference is that this kanji talks about<strong> surpass</strong>ing or crossing over a mountain (or the like) while 385 is used when<strong> surpass</strong>ing or transcending a amount of money, an expectation, etc. STORY: Some punk kids dared one of their friends to PASS/SURPASS the PARADE. So the kid got a RUNNING start but slipped on a DROP of something and landed face first in front of the PARADE ruining it."	"To make the marathon more challenging for the runners, they made them try to out-<a href=""../v4/384.html"">run</a> (#384 走) a parade going down the same path. The runners must come out before the parade, and<strong> SURPASS</strong> it, to win a shopping spree at Mitsukoshi or a trip to Vietnam. Oddly, this is a kanji in Mitsukoshi Dept store ( 三越 ) and Vietnam ( 越 )."		
是		just so	"In this kanji we are shown someone spending an entire <i>day</i> at <i>mending</i> one stocking, because they want the job done ""<b>just so</b>."" Be sure to make a clear image of a finicky old fusspot to make the abstract idea as concrete as possible."		9	414	388	17	ゼ、シ	これ、この、ここ	'Sun' 'Mend' - It<strong> just so</strong> happens that <em>sun</em>shine can <em>mend</em> your gloomy spirits.	My image here is of Fabrice (the guy who runs this website) spending all <em>day</em> obsessively <em>mending</em> the code so this page looks <strong>just so…</strong>.

題		topic	In many kinds of research, one can find information on a given <b>topic</b> only if the <i>headings</i> are prepared <i>just so</i>.		18	415	389	17	ダイ		"The ""TOPIC"" of the day's newspaper must be placed JUST SO at the top of the PAGE to attract attention."	You spend ALL DAY, mending your socks JUST SO. Then you have a look at the HEADING of the newspaper. The<strong> topic</strong>—FREE SOCKS TO BE GIVEN AWAY!!!!	The<strong> TOPIC</strong> is written as the <em>heading</em> of the <em>page just so</em> readers know what the article is about.	This<strong> topic</strong> is just so boring turn the page…!	It <strong>JUST SO</strong> happens that girls giving <strong>HEAD</strong> seems to be the number 1 <strong>TOPIC</strong> of high school gossip.		
堤		dike	A <b>dike</b> is a successful bit of engineering only if the amount of <i>earth</i> piled up is measured <i>just so</i> for the height and pressure of the water it is meant to contain.		12	416	390	17	テイ	つつみ	Making a<strong> dike</strong> is all about arranging the <em>soil just so…</em>.	The little Dutch boy has his finger stuck in the<strong> dike</strong>, and that's the only thing keeping his town from going under. He really really needs to go to the bathroom though, so he devises a plan to carefully add a bit of dirt - there, place individual bits in <strong>just so</strong> - there, I think it's good enough. Pull it out —–yes! Success!	Imagine Indiana Jones replacing a gemstone with a small bag of soil. If he doesn't weigh the soil just so, a huge<strong> dike</strong> behind the wall will break, washing him away.	<strong>Dike</strong>s are just so dirty.	The<strong> dike</strong> was very close to breaking. The people worked all <em>day</em> bringing <em>earth/soil</em> to <em>mend</em> it.		
建		build	To construct a <b>building</b>, you first draw a set of plans (the writing <i>brush</i>) and then <i>s-t-r-e-t-c-h </i>your drawing out to scale in reality.		9	417	391	17	ケン、コン	た.てる、た.て、-だ.て、た.つ	<strong>Build</strong> is easy to remember if you can remember that archtiechts have two steps in<strong> build</strong>ing. 1. Take a brush and brush out the blueprints. 2. Get a visual image of the blueprints all rolled up like they usually are. The second step is easy, it's just the architecht stretching out the blueprints and showing it to his clients.	A construction worker's classic morning. <em>Stretch, brush</em> his teeth, and then start to<strong> build</strong>.	To<strong> build</strong> a skyscraper, you have to stretch it upwards until it brushes the sky.	To<strong> build</strong> your Kanji ability, you must <em>brush away</em> the cobwebs from your head and <em>stretch</em> your imagination.	<strong>Building</strong> seen through the architect's eyes: Step 1: draw blueprints with best <em>brush</em> Step 2: <em>stretch</em> out on a lawn chair while other people<strong> build</strong> it!		
鍵		key	"The <i>golden</i> <b>key</b> you have been presented by the mayor gives you access to all the <i style='""font-weight:' bold>buildings</i> in the city."		17	418	2761	17	ケン	かぎ	The <em>metal</em> thing you need in order to enter things you <em>build</em> is a<strong> key</strong>.

This kanji means both lock and<strong> key</strong> to most Japanese people. 錠前 is technically the word for lock but it's not used in daily conversation."	They use metal to build<strong> key</strong>s.	In Zelda, the <em>gold</em><strong> key</strong> will let you into any <em>building</em>.	Many have tried and failed in seeking the<strong> key</strong> to El Dorado, the land of <em>golden buildings</em> (Imagine if El Dorado kept up with modern times).		
延		prolong	This character is a kind of pictographic image of how <b>prolonging</b> is a clever way of <i>stopping</i> things by trying to <i>stretch</i> them out a little bit at a time (the extra <i>drop</i> at the top of <i>stop</i>). Be sure to get a concrete image of this process, by imagining yourself <b>prolonging</b> something you can really, physically, <i>stretch</i>.		8	419	392	17	エン	の.びる、の.べる、の.べ、の.ばす	<em>Stretch</em>ing <em>correct</em>ly <strong>prolong</strong>s life. Even the top part of 正 is stretching…	If you want to<strong> prolong</strong> your sexual encounters, the best way to <em>stretch</em> them out is to <em>stop</em> your orgasm after just one <em>drop</em> has come out. (with inspiration from gorgon).	"Here's a great mnemonic: ""stop, drop, and stretch (!?)."" Now let's associate it with 'prolong': if you're ever in an uncomfortable spot, like being asked tricky questions or caught in a lie, just<strong> PROLONG</strong> the situation - stop, drop, and stretch. They may be confused by your odd behaviour, but it'll buy you a few moments to think up another good lie to get out of the sticky situation!"	The inquisitor<strong> prolong</strong>ed the torture because his victim didn't answer the question <em>correctly</em>. He turned the wheel <em>stretching</em> out his limbs even further.	To<strong> prolong</strong> means to stretch time for a drop (a little while) because you do not want something to stop.		
誕		nativity	The key word of course calls to mind the feast of Christmas. As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the <b>nativity</b> we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history: it represents the <i>prolongation</i> of the eternal <i>Word</i> in time and space.		15	420	393	17	タン		<strong>Nativity</strong> = born, being born. Think of <strong>birth</strong> as a painful and <em>prolong</em>ed event. And of course, all the <em>words</em> and curses being yelled at the soon-to-be father for doing this to her!	When you are being born ( <strong>nativity</strong> ), your mother's WORDS are PROLONGED. (Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis huuuuuuuuuuuuuurtss a lottttttttt~!! Owwwwwww!!!).	The<strong> nativity</strong> story: A child born to a virgin mother? Sounds to me like the <em>words</em> have <em>stretch</em>ed what is sensibly <em>correct</em>. Sadly, those <em>words</em> have continued to be spread through the <em>prolonged</em> use of the bible.	At<strong> Nativity</strong> (christmas), the priest says more Words (sermon) than the rest of the time, Prolonging mass duration.	誕生日 【たんじょうび】 (n) birthday; (P) 誕生石 【たんじょうせき】 (n) a birthstone STORY: On your BIRTHDAY people say WORDS of good luck and fortune to PROLONG your life.		
礎		cornerstone	"This character depicts a <b>cornerstone</b> as a <i>stone</i> set at the end of a wildlife preserve (the ""<i>zoo</i> in the<i> grove</i>"")."		18	421	394	17	ソ	いしずえ	Features like <em>stones</em> and <em>groves of trees</em> are the<strong> cornerstone</strong>s of a happy <em>zoo</em>.	A zoo which is still under construction is already full of animals. At the moment, only the<strong> cornerstone</strong> has been set in place. To temporarily keep the animals from escaping, a closely-packed grove of small trees is planted around the stone. (Note that this zoo needs some serious <em>mending</em>.).	<em>Stone Grove Zoo</em> is the new<strong> cornerstone</strong> in animal exhibits! If you love animals you need to check out <em>Stone Grove Zoo!</em>.	How am I the only one who doesn't see how mend turned into zoo with one stroke.	To make room for the new <em>zoo</em>, they use dynamite sending all the <em>grove's</em> trees flying in the air. That big <em>stone</em> on the left now serves as<strong> cornerstone</strong>. (Variation on ziggr's story, with more emphasis on placement that was giving me trouble).		
婿		bridegroom	"What makes a man a <b>bridegroom</b> is obviously a <i>woman</i> and her dowry, here presented as a small <i>zoo</i> (animals were often used for this purpose in earlier societies) and a <i>month</i> away from it all (the ""honey<i>moon</i>"")."		12	422	395	17	セイ	むこ	The virgin<strong> bridegroom</strong> tries to understand the new, mysterious <em>part of</em> his <em>woman's body</em> - but with little success. It's a <em>zoo</em> down there! (primitives placement: the part of the body is 'down there' - the woman is 'left' unsatisfied).	The only reason anyone talks about a<strong> bridegroom</strong> is if they're about to or have just gotten married. Of course, then you have to go on your honeymoon. So you take your <em>woman</em> to the <em>zoo</em> for a <em>month.</em> Pretty cool honeymoon.	Imagine a<strong> bridegroom</strong> having his wedding with his <em>woman</em> in a <em>zoo</em> on the <em>moon.</em> That will impress her! Fill out the details with the bride and groom floating with a menagerie of animals with astronaut helmets floating, bumping and attacking one another.	How did the eccentric<strong> bridegroom</strong> convince the <em>woman</em> to marry him? He built a <em>zoo</em> in the surface of the <em>moon</em> just for her!	The <strong>bridegroom</strong> will take his <em>woman</em> to the <em>zoo</em> for a <em>month</em> long honeymoon. (Simplifying dihutenosa).		
衣		garment	"At the top we see the <i>top hat</i>, and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a <b>garment</b>. If you break the ""4-fold"" fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember."	"* Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of <i>cloak</i> or <i>scarf</i> will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean <i>cloak</i>. At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the <i>top hat</i>) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a <i>scarf</i>. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a <i>top hat and scarf</i>. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of <i>garment</i> in general. Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429), the third from final stroke is ""unhooked."""	6	423	396	18	イ、エ	ころも、きぬ、-ぎ	The only<strong> garment</strong>s allowed in this club are <em>top hat</em> and <em>scarf</em>.	The<strong> garment</strong>s most commonly associated with the <em>craft</em> of a magician are the <em>top hat</em> and the <em>magic wand</em>. (It's a stretch, but the way I remembered this kanji is through that phrase. This way you can remember it through using primitives we have already learned.).	Dr. Who always wore a TOPHAT and SCARF, his most memorable<strong> GARMENT</strong>S.	A TOPHAT and a SCARF form a<strong> GARMENT</strong> that makes you barf.	A snowman wears a <em>top hat</em> and a <em>scarf</em> for <em><strong>garments&lt;/em&gt;</strong>.</em>		
裁		tailor	You might think here of <i>garment</i> that have been specially <b>tailored</b> for <i>Thanksgiving</i> celebrations to look like traditional Pilgrim garb.		12	424	397	18	サイ	た.つ、さば.く	The<strong> tailor</strong> was hard at work making sure all the pilgrims were dressed in their best <em>garments</em> for <em>thanksgiving</em>.	The<strong> tailor</strong> worked hard after <em>thanksgiving</em> to alter <em>garments</em> so they'd fit people who'd eaten too much at their <em>thanksgiving</em> dinners.	If you can make ten garments then you qualify as<strong> tailor</strong> and we will have a party to celebrate. Congratulations! You are all invited to the TenGarmentFiesta.	My<strong> TAILOR</strong> made me <em>10 garments</em> for the upcoming <em>fiestas</em>.	The<strong> TAILOR</strong> was invited to THANKSGIVING so he could sew up the turkey after the stuffing was put in. Too bad his GARMENT got dirty during the process. They should have killed the turkey first.		
装		attire	"The character for <b>attire</b> can be remembered as a picture of what we may call a ""<i>turtle-samurai</i>"" sweater. At the top we see the <i>turtle-samurai</i> and at the bottom the element for <i>garment</i>."		12	425	398	18	ソウ、ショウ	よそお.う、よそお.い	The TURTLE SAMURAI needs special GARMENTs for his<strong> ATTIRE</strong> since his body is much more ROBUST than others.	The <em>ninja turtles</em> tried to go eat at a fancy restaurant, but they were told to come back after their were dressed in proper<strong> attire</strong>. However, it's too difficult for them to find proper <em>garments</em> because they bodies are so <em>robust</em>! (sannomiya + drwarrior12).	<strong>Attire</strong> is more <em>robust</em> than a <em>garment</em>.	Only a <em>robust</em> <em>garment</em> is worthy of being called<strong> attire</strong>.	The TMNT tried to enter an expensive restaurant wearing nothing - they were told to come back with the appropriate<strong> attire</strong>. Not understanding the word<strong> attire</strong> nor how to wear clothes, they put on some clothes and, instead of buttoning stuff up, they put on <strong>a tire</strong> to hold their clothes up (inspired by synewave's story).		
裏		back	An innocent looking <i>top hat and scarf</i> lying there in front of you, turned over, reveal a hidden <i>computer</i> sewn into the <b>back</b> of each - obviously the tools of a master spy. Such experiences teach one always to have a look at the <b>back</b> side of things.		13	426	399	18	リ	うら	The <em>computer</em> had carefully dressed up in <em>clothes</em> to look human. It was n't until I looked at the<strong> back</strong> and saw the cables and stuff that I realized what it was.	Can computers be gay? I'm not sure, but mine always wears a top hat and scarf, and for some reason its<strong> back</strong> door port is always open…	I'll be<strong> back</strong> ! says the <em>computer</em> Terminator, disguised with a <em>top hat and a scarf</em>.	The COMPUTER wore a TOP HAT and SCARF to hide it's cables at the<strong> BACK</strong>. ( 裏 うら　bottom/back/reverse).	I was looking at porn on my <em>computer</em> and my roommate came in the room, so I hit the<strong> back</strong> button on the browser and pretended to be shopping for <em>top hats</em> and <em>scarves</em>.		
壊		demolition	The right half of this character shows a <i>garment</i> woven so fine that it can pass through the <i>eye</i> of a <i>needle</i>, fittingly draped around the slithering, ethereal form of a poltergeist. In this frame, our eerie visitor brushes its robes against a nearby block of apartments and completely <b>demolishes</b> them, razing them to the <i>ground</i>.		16	427	400	18	カイ、エ	こわ.す、こわ.れる、やぶ.る	If you stand too close to a<strong> DEMOLITION</strong> site, the dust might sting you like NEEDLES in your EYE and get your GARMENTs all dirty.	Since that needle eye thing turns up a lot, I turned it into Darth Vader. It kinda looks like him to me, with the eye being his metal mouth piece thing. So, Darth Vader swings his cape (his garment) demolishing a nearby building, leaving nothing but a pile of dirt.	During<strong> demolition</strong>, <em>dirt</em> and debris can feel like <em>needles in your eyes</em> if you're not wearing ther proper <em>garments</em>.	The dirt to the left is all that remains of the WTC on 9/11. On the right we have george bush wearing a perfectly clean and expensive suit/garment putting eyedrops in his eye to force an emotion over the victims of 9/11. He has to fake this emotion since 9/11 was a controlled<strong> demolition</strong>.	The<strong> demolition</strong> expert doesn't want DIRT in his 10 EYES, so he covers them with a SCARF.		
哀		pathetic	A drunken sod in a tattered <i>top hat</i> and soiled silk <i>scarf</i> with a giant <i>mouth</i> guzzling something or other gives us a <b>pathetic</b> character role in which W. C. Fields might find himself right at home.		9	428	401	18	アイ	あわ.れ、あわ.れむ、かな.しい	One of my friends with a crazy sense of fashion loves to wear a <em>tophat</em> and a <em>scarf</em> so that you can't see his whole face but only his <em>mouth</em>. He thinks it's cool. I think it's<strong> pathetic</strong>.	"A poor, homeless child like Oliver Twist, with a hungry open mouth, is<strong> pathetic</strong>– in the original sense of the noun ""pathos."" The tattered <em>tophat and scarf</em> he wears only adds to the pathos."	"Other definitions include grief, sorrow, pathos, pity, and sympathize. IMO the english word<strong> pathetic</strong> is often used nowadays to mean a sort of ""contemptuous pity"" but I think we need a more compasionate definition to understand 哀 , now and especially later when it starts being combined with other words…So, here's the top part of frame 308 享 (receive) but where the child was is now replaced by a scarf. Whatever fate befell the child is up to your imagination. grief, sorrow, pathos, sympathy,<strong> pathetic</strong>."	"That <em>tall</em> guy with the <em>scarf</em> is just so<strong> pathetic</strong>! (I can't help but see ""tall"" when I look at this kanji)."	A hat, a mouth and a cloak, I think that's all that beggar owns. How<strong> pathetic</strong>!		
遠		distant	A <b>distant</b> figure on the <i>road</i> is such a blur it looks like a <i>lidded crock</i> wearing a silk <i>scarf</i>.		13	429	402	18	エン、オン	とお.い	Keep<strong> distant</strong> from a <em>lidded crock</em> on the<em> road</em> wrapped in a <em>scarf</em>. It might be a bomb.	When traveling to a<strong> distant</strong> land, what better way of keeping warm on the road is there than carrying a warm lidded crock and wearing a scarf?	(NOTE: I am combining <em>lidded crock</em> and <em>scarf</em> into one NEW PRIMITIVE: <em>picnic</em>. As in, a <em>lidded crock</em> is filled with the food and the <em>scarf</em> is the picnic blanket.) When I'm on the <em>road</em> to <strong>distant</strong> lands and know there will be quite a <strong>distance</strong> between proper <em>road</em>side stops, I'm always extra careful and bring a <em>picnic</em>.	In a game called 'spin the <em>lidded-crock</em>', contestants see how far<strong> distant</strong> they can roll a crock down the <em>road</em> by wrapping it in a <em>scarf</em> and spinning it like a top; the only rule is that the lid must stay on the crock. Picture a referee measuring the distance on the <em>road</em> to see how far<strong> distant</strong> you've spun the crock.	It is best to stay <strong>distant</strong> from the <em>dirt</em>y <em>mouth</em>ed wino with the tatty <em>scarf</em> laying on the <em>road</em>.		
猿		monkey	This clever little <b>monkey</b> has captured an entire pack of <i>wild dogs</i>, locked them inside a <i>lidded crock</i>, and wrapped the whole thing up in a silk <i>scarf</i> to present to the dogcatcher.		13	430	403	18	エン	さる	The<strong> MONKEY</strong> likes to play hide and seek with the PACK of WILD DOGS by hiding in the LIDDED CROCK. But he is easy to see because the SCARF he always wears is at the base of the LIDDED CROCK.	To catch a <strong>monkey</strong>, chase him with <em>wild dogs</em> into a <em>lidded crock</em>, then tie it with a <em>scarf</em>.	"Honestly, I hate the ""Lidded Crock with a scarf"" metaphor. It makes no sense, and I just can't get an image that ""sticks"" with it, at all. Besides, it sounds retarded. The original meaning of the whole right side of this Kanji is ""Long Kimono."" So, put a wild dog in a kimono, stand him on two legs, and you've got something that looks like a man but still feral - a<strong> monkey</strong>."	We should be starring the 2009– stories, The 2006–2007 stories totally have a monopoly. GIVE THE NEW GUYS A CHANCE! ;) All you new guys star this.	"The upper right part means long kimono. 袁 is not in Heisig list, but if you remember it, you have an easier time later on. ""Long kimono"" is easier than ""lidded crock with scarf."" For its story look at Kanji 34945. Story for 猿 : If you put wild dogs in long kimonos, they look like<strong> monkey</strong> really."		
初		first time	"The primitives here take care of themselves: <i>cloak</i> and <i>dagger</i> .What I leave to you is to decide on an appropriate connotation for ""<b>first time</b>"" to take advantage of them."		7	431	404	18	ショ	はじ.め、はじ.めて、はつ、はつ-、うい-、-そ.める、-ぞ.め	"""This is the<strong> first time</strong> we've been out of the Shire, Mr. Frodo!"" Says Sam, covering himself with his cloak and clutching his dagger."	On his<strong> FIRST TIME</strong>, he <em>cloaked</em> his <em>dagger</em> with a Trojan.	Not only did I put on my robe and wizard's hat for my<strong> first time</strong>, but also my cloak and my dagger. That's when she walked out on me.	Your GF can get pregnant even on the <strong>first time</strong>… so from the <strong>first time</strong> on you should put a <em>cloak</em> on your <em>sword</em> (condom).	The<strong> first time</strong> I tried on my new <em>cloak</em>, I discovered the inside was lined with <em>daggers</em>. There was no second time.		
巾		towel	This character depicts a bolt of cloth wrapped around a pole. From there it gets its meaning of a <b>towel</b>.		3	432	2101	18	キン、フク	おお.い、ちきり、きれ、はば	If it looks like a <em>towel</em>, speaks like a <em>towel</em> and walks like a <em>towel</em>… I wonder why Heisig didn't include this one (as an actual kanji) in RtK 1.	Obvious<strong> towel</strong> is obvious.	If you got this far and need a story for<strong> towel</strong>, then you sir, have failed.	"A<strong> towel</strong> is used as a <em>belt</em> to hold in your ""<em>walking stick</em>""."	Primative from RTK1.		
布		linen	The maid, <i>towels by her side</i>, distributes the <b>linen</b>.		5	433	405	18	フ	ぬの	A matador holding his red<strong> linen</strong> by his side.	"The first rule of the <em>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Universe</em> is ""DON'T PANIC!"" The second rule, of course, is to always have a towel by your side. Personally, I prefer the<strong> linen</strong> sort."	A<strong> linen</strong> <em>towel</em> should always be <em>by your side</em> just in case .	If you made a towel showing all the great Communists of our time, 'linen' would be the furthest to the left.	Think of<strong> LINEN</strong>S 'N THINGS opening up a new location in outer space. All they sell are <em>towels</em>, and we all know no outer space journey is complete without a <em>towel</em> <em>by one's side</em>.		
帆		sail	A <b>sail</b> made of a <i>towel</i> makes a <i>mediocre</i> vessel.		6	434	406	18	ハン	ほ	When stranded at sea, we needed a<strong> Sail</strong>. The best we had was a TOWEL, which was MEDICORE, only catching a DROP of WIND.	A towel makes a mediocre<strong> sail</strong>.	A<strong> sail</strong> is a piece of <em>cloth</em> used to catch every <em>drop of wind</em>.	One handy use for a towel, according to the <em>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Universe</em>, is as a<strong> sail</strong>. The effect will be mediocre, however, if there is little wind.	A <em>towel</em> makes a <em>mediocre</em><strong> sail</strong>.		
幅		hanging scroll	A <i>towel</i> owned by the <i>wealthiest</i> tycoon in the world is made into a <b>hanging scroll</b> after his death and auctioned off to the highest bidder.		12	435	407	18	フク	はば	In the west, the rich use $100 bills to light their cigars… In Japan, after showering, when the wealthy don't have any clean towels, they simply grab a<strong> hanging scroll</strong> off the wall and use it to dry off!

In the west, the rich use $100 bills to light their cigars… In Japan, after showering, when the <em>wealthy</em> don't have any clean <em>towels left</em> , they simply grab a<strong> hanging scroll</strong> off the wall and use it to dry off! (Thanks Zazen! I can't seem to get the placement right here so I stuck the word left after towel to remind me where to put it!).	<strong>WIDTH</strong> (keyword change) <strong>TOWEL</strong> wrapped around an enormous waist, associated with <strong>WEALTH</strong> in Japan.		
帽		cap	Because of the <i>risk</i> involved (of getting the <i>sun</i> in one's <i>eyes</i>),one puts together a makeshift <b>cap</b> out of a dirty old <i>towel</i>.		12	436	408	18	ボウ、モウ	ずきん、おお.う	If you wear a towel as a<strong> cap</strong>, you are at risk of being seized and searched in U.S. airports.	Originally the first<strong> cap</strong> was a turban which was a <em>towel</em> wrapped around the head to keep the <em>sun</em> out of the <em>eyes</em>.	Because it's a <em>risk</em> to stay under the sun in the desert, Arabs use to wear a <em>towel</em> as a<strong> cap</strong>.	When I think of a Japanese-style<strong> cap</strong>, I think of a TOWEL wrapped around someone's head. And we all know that the Japanese are obsessed with using<strong> cap</strong>s, hats, umbrellas, etc. to minimize the RISK of skin damage. So know we have the form and the purpose of a<strong> cap</strong> in Japan.	A<strong> cap</strong> is a <em>cloth</em>, which can help reducing the <em>risk</em> of the <em>sun</em> getting into your <em>eyes</em>.		
幕		curtain	A dirty <i>towel</i> draped over the entrance to the old <i>graveyard</i> is painted to look like the <b>curtain</b> of death that leads to the otherworld.		13	437	409	18	マク、バク	とばり	There is a <em>graveyard</em> outside my house that scares me, so I put a huge towel over the window to serve as a<strong> curtain</strong> so I can get a good nights sleep.	"When you're dead in the <em>graveyard</em>, ""it's <strong>curtains</strong> for you.""."	"When a mobster says ""It's gonna be<strong> curtain</strong>s for you!"" He means you'll be wrapped in a towel, dead in a graveyard."	After Towelie died, instead of burying him in a grave, we hung him up as a<strong> curtain</strong> so the neighbours couldn't see us hitting the bong.	If you've read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (SPOILERS AHEAD!)…think of the<strong> curtain</strong> in the depths of the Department of Mysteries, and what happens when Sirius encounters that<strong> curtain</strong>. (Well, yes, it's technically a veil, but since Heisig doesn't use that as a keyword, think of it as a really big…um…<em>towel</em>.).		
幌		canopy	A large <i>towel</i> stretched overhead with only a few of the <i>sun's rays</i> breaking through represents a <b>canopy</b> over one's bed.		13	438	410	18	コウ	ほろ、とばり	A<strong> canopy</strong> is a <em>towel</em> to block the <em>suns</em> <em>ray</em>s.	From the <em>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Universe</em>: A towel is useful, among other things, as a<strong> canopy</strong> to keep out the sun's rays from your face while napping.	Picture a cafe in wartime Japan. Its'<strong> canopy</strong> is made of a big beach <em>towel</em> which has the imperial flag (the one with the <em>sun's rays</em>) printed upon it.	(fighter<strong> canopy</strong> and tree<strong> canopy</strong>) Luke Skywalker is flying to see Yoda on Dagobah. He starts to crash, and he pops his<strong> canopy</strong> and uses a towel as a parachute. He gets stuck in a tree too high to jump down. The sun comes and starts to get very hot. He feels like he will be cooked alive. Yoda comes and tells him to use the Force. Luke concentrates, and he takes a ray of light from the sun and makes it solid. He then climbs down it like it is a pole.	For a<strong> CANOPY</strong>, we improvised, using a <em>towel</em> to protect us from the <em>sun's rays</em>.		
錦		brocade	A strip of <i>white towel</i> and some scraps of <i>metal</i> have the makings of a primitive kind of <b>brocade</b>.		16	439	411	18	キン	にしき	<strong>Brocade</strong> is the art of sewing <em>gold</em> on a <em>white towel</em>.	Never heard of this word before encountering it here. So it turns out that the fanciest<strong> brocade</strong> in the world is actually a towel used by a Turkish monarch. It's embroidered with <em>gold</em> and <em>cocaine</em>. Yes, <em>cocaine</em> - what you thought it'd be something else? That is some true art right there. I think a great many people would want to own this towel.	"""Brocade"" means 'twisted thread', and is usually made with gold and silver. Here it is written as a <em>towel</em> woven with <em>gold</em> and <em>white</em>."	First, the meaning of<strong> brocade</strong> in English: fabric woven with an elaborate design, esp. a raised pattern. Imagine GOLD threads embedded in a WHITE silk TOWEL. I carried my<strong> brocade</strong> to the airport and the GOLD set off the METAL detector!	The problem with this kanji was that the towel pictured by me was white in the first place (and I'm not changing colours/shapes/overall appearance of my primitives only to adjust them to new kanji, oh no sir…). So I have a white dove pecking golden<strong> brocade</strong> out of the towel.		
市		market	Dressed in nothing but a bath <i>towel</i> and <i>top hat</i>, one sets off to the <b>market</b>place in search of a bargain or two.		5	440	412	18	シ	いち	My recurring nightmare: Walking through the<strong> market</strong>, and suddenly realizing that I'm wearing only a top hat…and a towel.	At the<strong> MARKET</strong> you find lots of nice TOP HATS and TOWELS.	An investor gets a tip while in the shower. With no time to loose he runs down to the stock<strong> market</strong>, only wearing a bath <em>towel</em>. And the <em>top hat</em>, of course, according to the dress code at the stock exchange.	I was walking in the<strong> market</strong>, minding my own business, when an old man in a <em>top hat</em> and <em>towel</em> flashed me. I still have nightmares.	After European contact in the 19th century, many Africans adopted aspects of European dress mixed with their own style. So imagine a dusty West African town where the men roam around in <em>top hats</em> and <em>towels</em> as they wander the busy<strong> market</strong>.		
柿		persimmon	Imagine a village <i>market</i> with stalls set up around an immense <b>persimmon</b> <i>tree</i> with watermelon-sized fruit. If it weren't for the fact that the <i>tree</i> is sacred to the village, people would get impatient as the <b>persimmons</b> fall from the <i>tree</i> and wreak havoc on buyers and sellers alike.		9	441	2481	18	シ	かき、こけら	Nobody buys<strong> persimmon</strong>s at the <em>market</em>, because there's a <em>tree</em> in the middle where you can pick them for free.	<strong>Persimmon</strong> = かき - they grow on <em>trees</em> and are sold at the <em>market</em>.	The guy at the <em>market</em> says: I'll give you one<strong> persimmon</strong> <em>tree</em> per every Simon you bring me!	The <em>tree</em> growing in the <em>market</em> bears <strong>persimmons</strong>.	"The official TREE of the MARKET is the<strong> PERSIMMON</strong>. (because somehow the vendors believe it keeps shoppers from being ""persimmonious"".)."		
姉		elder sister	Of all the <i>women</i> of the family, it is the <b>elder sister</b> who has the duty to go to <i>market</i> to do the shopping.		8	442	413	18	シ	あね、はは	Unlike the <em>younger sister</em> ( 妹 ), who is <em>not yet</em> old enough to date… the<strong> elder sister</strong> is on the <em>market</em>!	She's old enough to be allowed to go to the market.	My<strong> ELDER SISTER</strong> is a WOMAN who works at the MARKET.	The GIRL who goes to MARKET is the<strong> ELDER SISTER</strong>.	The<strong> elder sister</strong> is the woman who does the chores and goes to market while her mother is at work.		
肺		lungs	One is surprised, strolling through the <i>market</i>, to find among the <i>meats</i> hung out for sale a slab marked: <b>lungs</b>.		9	443	414	18	ハイ		"The PART OF THE BODY most important if you work at a MARKET is your<strong> LUNGS</strong> so that you can shout out at the top of your voice ""IRASSHAIMASEEE"" to attract customers."	<strong>LUNGS</strong> are a PART of the BODY that can be found at any meat MARKET or black MARKET.	So that I could breathe when I got there, I visited the <em>moon market</em> to buy a new set of<strong> LUNGS</strong> for my trip to the moon.	When you hear<strong> lungs</strong>, think of a) a <em>body part</em>, and b) a smoker. A smoker will be in the <em>market</em> for a new <em>body part</em>: a fresh pair of<strong> lungs</strong>. 肺 (はい) : lung; 片肺飛行 かたはいひこう flying on one engine.	This month<strong> lungs</strong> are being sold at the market.		
帯		sash	The part of the <i>apron</i> where one finds the <i>buckle</i> (represented pictorially by the first 5 strokes) is on the <b>sash</b>.		10	444	415	18	タイ	お.びる、おび	"First, note that the top half of the kanji consists of <em>one</em> and <em>mountain</em>. Of course, the ""<em>number 1</em>"" <em>mountain</em> in Japan is <em>Mt.</em> Fuji. The bottom half, under <em>Mt.</em> Fuji, consists of <em>crown</em> and <em>towel</em>. Now for the story. Archaeologists digging under <em>Mt.</em> Fuji (Japan's <em>#1</em> <em>mountain</em>) in an ancient royal tomb (they know it's royal because of the <em>crown</em>) discover what looks like a <em>towel</em>, but after they clean it up, they see it is actually a splendid royal <em>sash</em> for the king's kimono."	WARNING: Try to avoid thinking of the upper element as a combination of <em>one</em> and <em>mountain</em>, because in this case you will get used to the incorrect stroke order.	"Beautiful ""Miss Housewife Japan"" is on posters everywhere, cooking right before Mt. Fuji (the <em>number one</em> <em>mountain</em>) while wearing nothing but her crown, and an <em>apron</em> tied with a<strong> sash</strong>. (hodgepodge of mspertus, zwarte_kat, et al, with a jot of hadaka apron to focus the image.)."	"The <em>buckle</em> is on the<strong> sash</strong> of the <em>apron</em>. (Note that according to the dictionary, breaking down this Kanji includes only the radicals for ""walking stick"", ""one"", ""crown"" and ""towel"". Hence, ""mountain"" is not part of the radicals.)."	Heisig fails to go into detail about the top kanji, but, It's not a mountain like everyone is saying. It actually means <em>Thirty</em> 丗 the stroke order starts with a <em>One</em>, then draw in the three vertical lines from left to right. Then the last stroke at the bottom closing it up. Then comes the <em>Apron</em> which makes up a<strong> Sash</strong>. (-Story: I made a<strong> Sash</strong> out of <em>Thirty</em> cut up <em>Aprons</em>.		
滞		stagnate	"People that have been ""<i>sashed</i>"" to something (whether their mother's apron strings or a particular job) for too long become like <i>water</i> that has stopped moving: they start to <b>stagnate</b>."		13	445	416	18	タイ、テイ	とどこお.る	History of the first karate blackbelts: In those days, it was often difficult to find fresh, clean <em>water</em>, so samurai usually had to wash their <em>sashes</em> in <strong>stagnant</strong> puddles. The longer one had been studying martial arts, the older the sash on one's karate uniform and, therefore, the darker the color. So why weren't their karate uniforms black too? Never seen a ninja????	A moat is a<strong> stagnate</strong> ring of water like an obi (sash) of water tied around the castle.	"WATER that is ""tied up"" as if with a SASH and unable to flow properly will become<strong> stagnate</strong>."	This is one I keep missing, and always because of the right-hand side. I can easily associate<strong> stagnate</strong> with <em>water</em> but never with <em>sash.</em> And so I will now try to associate<strong> stagnate</strong> with something around the house that often<strong> stagnate</strong>s and smells awful: the kitchen <em>washrag</em>. From washrag, I will make the association with <em>sash</em>.	The <em>water</em> became<strong> stagnate</strong> because the drain was clogged with a <em>sash</em>.

"Why all the gore and violence? How about a samurai cow? He doesn't have to be a violent samurai, either. He only wears the sword because he's part of the <em>bushi</em><strong> SYSTEM</strong>.

The master asks him if a dog has buddha nature and, shifting the swords in his belt, he calmly replies, ""Moo!""."	Gary Larson cartoon of the feudal Japanese <strong>system</strong>: <em>cows</em> walking around with <em>belts</em>, complete with katana <em>sabers</em>. The Sa-MOO-rai class <strong>system</strong>.	Jurassic Park has a<strong> system</strong> for feeding velociraptors. First a <em>cow</em> gets <em>belt</em>ed. Second the cow is lowered down into the raptors' cage. Third the raptor ruptures the cow with his <em>saber</em> like talons.	I used Heisig story here but i tweaked it a little. It works better for me if i imagine the belt is around the tail of the cow, cause that it what it looks like in the kanji.		
製		made in...	A label indicating that a <i>garment</i> was <b>made in</b> U.S.A. or Taiwan or Japan is itself a symbol for the <i>systematization</i> of the <i>garment</i> industry.		14	448	419	18	セイ		<strong>Made in</strong> china - a system of exploitation . making garments for nothing.	<strong>Made in…</strong> is a <em>system</em> of labels you can find on every <em>garment</em>s.	A SYSTEMATICALLY made GARMENT will no doubt have<strong> MADE IN</strong> on the label.	We have a <em>system</em> in the US where all <em>garments</em> have labels saying what country they are <strong>made in</strong>.	You find a curious toy: a <em>cow</em> wearing a <em>belt</em> and a <em>saber</em>, and also <em>clothes</em> under them. You look at it wondering where it was <strong>made in</strong>.		
転		revolve	As the wheels of the <i>car</i> <b>revolve</b>, they kick up small <i>rising clouds</i> of dust and debris behind them.		11	449	420	18	テン	ころ.がる、ころ.げる、ころ.がす、ころ.ぶ、まろ.ぶ、うたた、うつ.る、くる.めく	The REVOLVING wheels of the car (with<strong> REVOLVE</strong>R blaring on the stereo) kicked up RISING CLOUDS of dust.	"Just a note to remember the <em>cloud</em> primative: The name of Goku's pet <em>cloud</em> that he used to help him rise (fly) in the Dragonball anime series (and also the scientific name for a certain type of cloud) is <em>Nimbus</em> [ <a href=""http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/dbztlog/screen2.jpg"">http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/dbztlog/screen2.jpg</a> ]. The katakana-ization of this is <strong>ニム</strong>バス, so the <em>rising cloud</em> primative is just an abbreviation of that name written from top to bottom in the old Japanese style."	Burnout! As the car's wheels <em>revolve</em> the rubber burns making a <em>rising cloud</em> of smoke!	You could just think of someone smoking their tires before taking off. They're staying in one place, but the wheels of the car keep revolving round and round as a cloud of burnt rubber rise from them. To keep distinct from rotation (1046), think of rpms (revolutions per minute).	The <em>car</em>'s wheels<strong> revolve</strong>, sending up a <em>rising cloud</em> of dust.		
芸		technique	The secret <b>technique</b> of making a <i>rising cloud</i> of smoke turn into a bouquet of <i>flowers</i> is shown here.		7	450	421	18	ゲイ、ウン	う.える、のり、わざ	"Imagine an old Kung-fu movie: ""Try my <em>rising cloud</em> <em>flower</em><strong> technique</strong>!!!"" <em> smash </em> <em> pow </em> <em> crack!! </em>."	One<strong> technique</strong> to smoke weed is to vaporize it and inhale those rising clouds to create a stronger effect.	I've mastered a<strong> TECHNIQUE</strong> for making my farts (the <em>cloud</em>) smell like roses (the <em>flower</em>).	David Copperfield throws a bouquet of flowers into the air, whereupon they turn into a rising cloud of smoke. The audience gasps in admiration of his<strong> technique</strong>.	"Think of the ""Daisy"" ad used against Goldwater in the 1964 campaign. A little girl counts as she picks petals off a FLOWER, then you hear a countdown and see a mushroom CLOUD. It's one of the most famous examples of advertising<strong> technique</strong>."		
雨		rain	This kanji, also a primitive, is one of the clearest instances we have of a complex pictograph. The top line is the sky, the next 3 strokes a pair of clouds, and the final 4 dots the <b>rain</b> collected there and waiting to fall.	* As a primitive it can mean either <i>rain</i> or <i>weather</i> in general. Because it takes so much space, it usually has to be contracted into a crown by shortening the second and third strokes into a crown.	8	451	422	18	ウ	あめ、あま-、-さめ	From the <em>ceiling</em> hangs a <em>towel</em> dripping four <em>drops</em> like<strong> RAIN</strong>.	The<strong> rain</strong> falls from the sky, landing like teardrops on my windows.	It<strong> rain</strong>ed so hard that we had to put a <em>towel</em> under the <em>ceiling</em> to contain the <em>drops</em> that came through.	Towel hung out on a line to ….oops, it's<strong> rain</strong>.	A pictograph of a window with<strong> rain</strong> falling outside.		
雲		cloud	Here is the full character for <b>cloud</b> from which the primitive for a <i>rising cloud</i> derives. <i>Clouds</i> begin with vapors <i>rising</i> up in small <i>clouds</i> from the surface of the earth, and then gathering to make <b>clouds</b> that eventually dump their <i>rain</i> back on the earth.		12	452	423	18	ウン	くも、-ぐも	Every <em>rising<strong> cloud</strong></em> is a potential <em>rain</em><strong> cloud</strong>. (Thanks astridtops).	Every<strong> cloud</strong> is a potential <em>rain</em><strong> cloud</strong>.	A<strong> cloud</strong> represents the stage of the earth's water cycle between when <em>rising <strong>clouds</strong></em> of water vapor head for the sky and when <em>rain</em> falls.	That's a funny<strong> cloud</strong>… it seems to be shooting rain up above it instead of letting it drop to the earth…	This kanji shows the weather cycle. Rain falls from the rain<strong> cloud</strong>s, and then becomes a<strong> cloud</strong> of vapour that rises up and the whole thing begins again.		
曇		cloudy weather	We refer to days when the <i>sun</i> is covered by the <i>clouds</i> as <b>cloudy weather</b>.		16	453	424	18	ドン	くも.る	<strong>Cloudy weather</strong> is when a <em>cloud</em> blocks the <em>sun</em> (up above).	I have difficulty remembering that the rain is ABOVE the clouds, which is not its logical spot. This is<strong> cloudy weather</strong>, not rainy weather. So I imagine the <em>sun</em> <em>raining</em> down on the <em>clouds</em> instead.	DO NOT MISTAKE CLOUD AND<strong> CLOUDY WEATHER</strong> . Remember that CLOUD is a smaller kanji, as well as a smaller keyword. Also in Japanese it is smaller (kumo vs. kumori).	The <em>sun</em> is above the <em>clouds</em>, the definition of<strong> cloudy weather</strong>.	<strong>Cloudy weather</strong> is actually the English weather: <em>sunny</em>, <em>rainy</em> and <em>cloudy</em> at the same time.		
雷		thunder	The full rumble and roar and terror of <b>thunder</b> is best felt not with your head tucked under your pillow safe in bed, but out in an open <i>rice field</i> where you can get the real feel of the <i>weather</i>.		13	454	425	18	ライ	かみなり	If it's <em>raining</em> and you're standing in the middle of a <em>rice field</em>, you're sure to soon become acquainted with the<strong> thunder</strong> up close and personal.	<strong>Thunder</strong> is a sure sign of <em>rain</em> coming. When you hear the<strong> thunder</strong>, you've got time to get out of the <em>field</em> before it starts <em>raining</em>.	I've been told by Japanese people that this word, 雷 （かみなり）　means BOTH<strong> thunder</strong> and lightning together. Though there is no individual word for<strong> thunder</strong>, there is for lightning (いなずま）, so I understand where Heisig is coming from. Just remember a powerful storm over an empty field and you're sure to remember this kanji.	It's the<strong> Thunder</strong> with the <em>rain</em> that'll rattle your <em>brain</em>.	In the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, once you obtain the third Spiritual Stone, you head to the castle to see the Princess. By the time you get there, RAIN is lashing down on Hyrule FIELD and<strong> thunder</strong> crashes overhead. And then you're nearly flattened by a horse, attacked by a madman and made to jump into a moat! Life's tough.		
霜		frost	Think of <b>frost</b> as a cooperative venture, an <i>inter</i>-action of the malevolent forces of <i>weather</i> that sit around a conference table and finally decide to allow a very light amount of moisture to fall just before a short and sudden freeze.		17	455	426	18	ソウ	しも	<strong>FROST</strong> is kind of an <em>inter</em>-<em>weather</em>, phenomenon, something between rain, snow and freezing temp’s.	The freezing RAIN formed<strong> FROST</strong> on the TREE right before your EYES. If you want,<strong> frost</strong>-y then think<strong> Frost</strong> Tree to get to the mnemonic. SECOND STORY:<strong> FROST</strong>Y the snowman? It's RAIN that<strong> FROST</strong>S that can then INTER-act with the kids, till he melts of course.	"<strong>rain</strong> changes <strong>""inter""</strong><strong> frost</strong>."	The <em>inter</em>-action between <em>rain</em> and cold makes<strong> frost</strong>.	It was <em>raining</em> outside onto the trees, and you dared your friend to stick his tongue out on the tree (you weren't quite sure if it would stick, like your tongue will to metal when it gets cold). Your friend decided to one-up you and stick his <em>eye</em> on the <em>tree</em>, and just then, it got super cold and a layer of<strong> frost</strong> covered the city. Your friend's <em>eye</em> got stuck on the <em>tree</em>, but he had to go home to do his homework, so he dashed off with his <em>eye</em> stuck there on the tree.		
冬		winter	<i>Walking legs</i> slipping on the <i>ice</i> are a sure sign of <b>winter</b>.		5	456	427	18	トウ	ふゆ	Don't slip off your legs in<strong> winter</strong>, strap two skis to your feet.	In<strong> winter</strong> my <em>walking legs</em> feel like blocks of <em>ice</em>.	In<strong> Winter</strong>, there's <em>ice</em> beneath your <em>walking legs</em>! Be careful, even just two icelets could slip you up!	A pair of <em>walking legs</em> skating over <em> ice</em> during<strong> winter</strong>.	In<strong> WINTER</strong>, I always slip on ICE with my WALKING LEGS.		
天		heavens	This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the <b>Heavens</b>. (You may, of course, use the elements <i>ceiling</i> and <i>St. Bernard</i> instead.)	* The primitive can mean either the <i>heaven</i> of eternal bliss or the general term for sky, the <i>heavens</i>. Pay special attention to the fact that in its primitive form the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of thousand (Frame 40), rather than left to right. From the next character, we shall give it the primitive meaning of a <i>witch</i>.	4	457	428	18	テン	あまつ、あめ、あま-	If you think of the sky as a <em>ceiling</em> above our heads, here you have the<strong> heavens</strong> as the <em>largest ceiling</em> you could ever imagine. As Heisig pointed out, nothing comes above the <em>ceiling</em> primitive thus the order of primitives is taken care of.	The <em>ceiling</em> that all <em>large dogs</em> aspire to go to is known as heaven. After all, <em>All Dogs Go to Heaven</em>.	The BIG ONE lives upstairs, in the<strong> heavens</strong>…	Tip: 天 and 夭 (<em>heavens</em> and <em>sapling</em>) are different, but RTK confuses them sometimes. The latter appears in numbers 634, 938, 2078, 2079, 2080, and all characters containing <em>angel</em> 喬 (429, 430, 1221, 2104, 2120, 2369).	"Not all dogs go to heaven - only <em>one</em> <em>St. Bernard</em> gets to go (because he's a ""Saint"" Bernard)."		
妖		bewitched	You are <b>bewitched</b> by a <i>woman</i> who is, of course, a <i>witch</i>.		7	458	2078	18	ヨウ	あや.しい、なま.めく、わざわ.い	If you don't want to get <strong>bewitched</strong> (and who would?), then avoid any <em>woman</em> you see carrying what might appear to be a <em>sapling</em>. It's really a wand in disguise, and if you're not aware you might get <strong>bewitched</strong>.	I was<strong> bewitched</strong> by the <em>woman fairy</em> (like an angel, but not as tall).	Primitive: fallen angel.	<em>sigh</em>. For some reason, Heisig never seems to understand the difference between 夭 and 天 . This uses the former, which means young/sapling. Surely it's not hard to imagine a young witch messing up a spell and accidentally bewitching everyone around her?	<strong>Bewitched</strong> <em>women</em> can't come into the <em>heavens</em>.		
沃		irrigate	Suffering from a drought, the farmers call on a <i>witch</i> who conjures up <i>water</i> to <b>irrigate</b> their crops.		7	459	2079	18	ヨウ、ヨク、オク	そそ.ぐ	You use <em>water</em> to<strong> irrigate</strong> your <em>saplings</em>.	"A <em>fairy</em> needs a lot of <em>water</em> to<strong> irrigate</strong> those beating wings, so you have make sure they drink a lot to be well<strong> irrigate</strong>d (see <a href=""../v4/2078.html"">bewitched</a> (#2078 妖)."	<em>Water</em> from the <em>heavens</em> is nature's way of <strong>irrigating</strong>.	<strong>Irrigation</strong> is the method used to <em>water</em> crops instead of relying on the gods in the <em>heavens</em> to send them <em>drops</em> as if they were <em>dogs</em> waiting for a <em>sapling</em> to be tossed for them to catch and retrieve.	<em>Water</em> being used to<strong> irrigate</strong> the <em>sapplings</em> as it is a drought.		
橋		bridge	"The <b>bridge</b> shown here is made of <i>trees</i> in their natural form, except that the trunks have been carved into the forms of <i>angels</i>, a sort of ""Ponte degli Angeli."""		16	460	429	18	キョウ	はし	The nicest<strong> bridge</strong> is not in Holly<em>wood</em> or Los <em>Angel</em>es, but in San Francisco.	"A small 5 year old child has lost her mother in a tragic death. Her family tells her, ""Don't worry, your mom is an angel now, in heaven, watching over you."" The small girl takes this very literally and is found one day, gathering pieces of wood. Her dad asks her, ""What are you doing with that wood?"" ""I'm trying to build a<strong> bridge</strong> to heaven to visit the angels.""."	"<strong>BRIDGE</strong> makes me remember a tacky religious icon of my youth, showing a guardian <em>angel</em> guiding two bonny children over a dangerously tatty <em>wooden</em><strong> BRIDGE</strong>; by pure chance (ahem) I found the picture online, see <a href=""http://www.sacredtreasures.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Guardian_angel_on_the_Bridge.199121024_std.jpg"">http://www.sacredtreasures.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Guardian_angel_on_the_Bridge.199121024_std.jpg</a> 'Angel', incidentally, means 'messenger', hence two mouths - one who gave the message above, the other who delivered it here below."	The <em>wooden</em><strong> bridge</strong> is guarded by an impressively tall <em>angel</em>.	ANGEL primitive: On the bottom there is a HOODED MOUTH, which you can think of as a NUN; and shes praying to an ANGEL, which is the HEAVENLY MOUTH above.		
嬌		attractive	Associating a particularly <b>attractive</b> <i>woman</i> you know with an <i>angel</i> should be no problem.		15	461	430	18	キョウ	なまめか.しい	The most <strong>attractive</strong> <em>woman</em> in the world is obviously <em>Angelina</em> Jolie.	The most<strong> attractive</strong> of <em>women</em> are said to resemble <em>angels</em>. Similarly, <em>angelic</em> <em>women</em> tend to be<strong> attractive</strong>.	Be careful not to confuse this with <em>exquisite</em> (women + few - frame [123]). I try to keep them distinct by remembering that all <em>women</em> <em>angels</em> are<strong> attractive</strong>, but few women are truly exquisite.	<strong>Attractive</strong> <em>women</em> are usually no <em>angels</em>. On the contrary, they are usually quite bitchy.	Just because a <em>woman</em> is<strong> attractive</strong> doesn't mean she's an <em>angel</em>.		
立		stand up	This picture of a vase <b>standing up</b> has its meaning extended to represent the general posture of anything <b>standing up</b>.	* Used as a primitive, it can also mean <i>vase</i>. Using its kanji meaning, think of something <i>standing up</i> that is normally lying down, or something standing up in an unusual way.	5	462	431	18	リツ、リュウ、リットル	た.つ、-た.つ、た.ち-、た.てる、-た.てる、た.て-、たて-、-た.て、-だ.て、-だ.てる	A vase that can't<strong> stand up</strong> won't be a vase for long.	This is a real<strong> stand up</strong> vase. It even wears a top hat!	He was a<strong> stand up</strong> guy: he'd lend you the top hat he wears everyday if you asked, and he will turn everything upside down to help you find your tools.	<strong>Stand up</strong> a vase on a table and put a top hat on it and then represent it pictographically and there you have this kanji!	If i'm feeling <em>horn</em>y, I cover the area with my <em>top hat</em> when I<strong> stand up</strong>.		
泣		cry	One <b>cries</b> and <b>cries</b> until one is <i>standing up</i> knee-deep in <i>water</i> (or until one has a <i>vase</i>-full of <i>water</i>).		8	463	432	18	キュウ	な.く	Guys have two ways of watering when they are standing, the less common one is<strong> cry</strong>ing.	She <em>stood up</em> to leave the room when her eyes started to <em>water</em>…	This won't make sense for anyone who hasn't played the game, but for those who have, it'll make this character very easy to remember. Just picture that one scene in Final Fantasy VII where Cloud is <em>standing</em> in the <em>water</em> about to let Aeris go… A very sad scene which can make anyone<strong> cry</strong>.	I imagine Alice (in Wonderland) standing in a pool of her own making,<strong> cry</strong>ing to herself.	If you<strong> cry</strong> really hard you can fill up a vase with the water from your tears.		
章		badge	Try to imagine a club <b>badge</b> pinned to your lapel in the form of a mammoth <i>sunflower</i> protruding from a wee little <i>vase</i>.		11	464	433	18	ショウ		In the military,<strong> badge</strong>s are given out <em>early</em> in the day, with everyone <em>standing</em> at attention.	"Ash Ketchum <em>stood</em> up <em>early</em> in the morning, and said, ""Pikachu, let's go get us another<strong> badge</strong>!""."	Those who STAND UP EARLY receive a<strong> BADGE</strong>.　ショウ 文章 ぶんしょう(a sentence).	Only British people will understand this, sorry. Remember the Blue Peter<strong> badge</strong>s and the yearly sunflower competition? Imagine a group of sunflowers, many of then dropping but one is standing well and looking great. This is the obvious winner for the Blue Peter<strong> badge</strong>.	Taking a bunch of <em>vases</em> and painting <em>sunflowers</em> on the bottom is the only way for a Girl Scout to get her arts and crafts merit<strong> badge</strong>.		
競		vie	Two <i>teenagers</i> are seen here <i>standing up</i> to one another, <b>vying</b> for the attention of their peers.		20	465	434	18	キョウ、ケイ	きそ.う、せ.る	TWO twin BROTHERS are competing (VYING) for the title of who is the older BROTHER. The game is that they must balance a VASE on their head and the one who drops his looses and becomes the younger BROTHER!	Two crazy brothers vying for the guiness records books of stupidity by trying to stand on their heads the longest.	"Roman times. Coliseum. Two <em>teenagers</em> with <em>vases</em> of acid strapped to their heads. They<strong> vie</strong> with one another, each trying to break the vase on their opponent's head. Imagine what happens to the loser when his vase breaks. To avoid confusion with ""contend"", ""war"", etc, remember that<strong> Vie</strong> and Vase both start with ""v""."	Twin <em>brothers</em> lined up side to side, each<strong> VIE</strong> to <em>stand</em> taller than the other.	My two <em>elder brothers</em> <strong>vied</strong> to impress the same girl by singing under her window. Unimpressed by the performance, both of her neighbours dropped their <em>vases</em> on them.		
帝		sovereign	An uncommon, but not altogether unlikely picture of a reigning <b>sovereign</b> has him <i>standing up</i> in his <i>apron</i>, presumably at the behest of HIS <b>sovereign</b> (she who is to be obeyed), who needs help with washing the dishes.		9	466	435	18	テイ	みかど	The crazy<strong> sovereign</strong> stands up from his throne, wearing nothing but a crown and a towel. That's why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public.	"This one is so tricky for me. The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the <em>standing</em> element takes those little crown ""winglets"" on the right and left. The most effective image might be of QEII (who is quite short) using her crown as a kind of stool. She's <em>standing</em> on her <em>crown</em> rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her <em>apron.</em> I guess the<strong> sovereign</strong>'s servants have the day off."	Imaging queen Elizabeth…england's<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong> as she STANDS at the sink doing dishes wearing nothing but an APRON.	The<strong> sovereign</strong> likes to make his female servants <em>stand</em> around in nothing but <em>aprons</em>. Can't say I blame him.	"The first thing you need to be a<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong>, is to STAND TALL above your people and inspire them with confidence. The second would be to wear a cool CROWN. Third and most important, please wear underwear or at least a TOWEL to cover up you privates. People are going to be ""looking up to you."" (Inspired by WithLoveFromExIA's post)."		
諦		renunciation	"The key word <b>renunciation</b> has to do with the wisdom and clarity of mind in knowing when to ""let go.""

商		make a deal	See the peddlar <i>standing</i> atop his <i>motorcycle helmet</i> as if it were a soapbox, hawking his wares to passersby. The <i>legs</i> and <i>mouth</i> represent the tools of the trade of <b>making a deal</b> any way you can.		11	471	439	18	ショウ	あきな.う	I use what I think is the real etymology for this kanji which is so shocking it sticks. The STANDING member at the top is a certain part of the body that all men have and it is approaching the HOLE between TWO LEGS (the HOOD) with extra marks to show they are FLESHY - ie a womans legs. So this shows the oldest DEAL of all time - prostitution.	"Slick Willy standing on the motorcycle helmet he's trying to sell you to demonstrate how rugged it is. His legs crash through the top of it and after a moment of awkward silence his mouth opens and says, ""hey, we can still<strong> make a deal</strong>.""."	<em>Four</em> loud<em>mouths</em> trying to<strong> make a deal</strong> on a <em>vase</em>.	NOT a vase or stand up but actually represents a penis, as subtly pointed out by samuize.

Apologies for the rudeness, but that's what it's about.	At the beginning of <strong>Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi</strong>, Luke Skywalker is <em>standing</em> at the edge of a giant sand pit, awaiting to to be consumed by the Sarlacc, a giant ant lion-like creature that lives in the pit.

嫡		legitimate wife	"The phrase <b>legitimate wife</b> would have no meaning if there were not such things as ""illegitimate wives,"" taken because one's legal <i>woman</i> has turned into an <i>antique</i>. The very offense of the idea should help you remember the kanji."		14	472	440	18	チャク、テキ		Legitmate wifes tend to be women who are antiques in contrast to the young bit of illigitmate fluff on the side.	Your<strong> legitimate wife</strong> is like an antique bong. Its not your favorite but you still hit it sometimes…	The <em>woman</em> you'll want to be with even when you're both <em>antique</em> should be your<strong> LEGITIMATE WIFE</strong>.	When the <strong>legitimate wife</strong> finds her husband flirting with another <em>woman</em>, she'll take the valuable <em>antique Ming-vase</em> and whacks him with it over the head.

敵		enemy	Picture your most precious <i>antique</i> (it doesn't matter how old it really is, so long as it is the oldest thing YOU own) being knocked over by your most unlikeable <i>taskmaster</i>, and you have a good picture of how people make themselves <b>enemies</b> for life.		15	475	443	18	テキ	かたき、あだ、かな.う	The <em>taskmaster</em> became my<strong> enemy</strong> for life when he smashed the <em>antique vase</em> holding my wife's ashes.	For us Miami Cubans, that <em>antique taskmaster</em> (Fidel) is the <strong>enemy</strong>.	For the academics: (I always view a taskmaster as being a professor) An <em>antique taskmaster</em> - or professor with an outdated and inefficient teaching philosophy - is your<strong> enemy</strong> in regard to accumulating knowledge.	Link must destroy ANTIQUE vases to replenish items when fighting the TASKMASTER, his main<strong> ENEMY</strong>.	In Indy Jones movies the<strong> enemy</strong> is always a taskmaster who is after antiques.		
匕		spoon	This character, a pictograph of a <b>spoon</b>, is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for <i>seven</i>, where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second.	* As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone <i>sitting on the ground</i>, of which it can also be considered a pictograph. In general, the second stroke does not cut through the first - or if it does in some fonts, only slightly.	2	476	444	18	ヒ	さじ、さじのひ	"To remember the primitive meaning, picture someone sitting on the ground performing Seppuku…with a<strong> spoon</strong>. <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/co48k"">http://tinyurl.com/co48k</a>."	Not only is stroke order important, but also be sure to note the <em>direction</em> of a stroke. In both 'spoon' and 'seven', the first stroke is the horizontal one - but here it is written right to left in a downward flick, while in 'seven' it is a strong line from left to right.	Just remember it.	I sat on the ground, feeding myself jelly with a<strong> spoon</strong>.	Imagine Winnie the Pooh sitting on the ground eating honey with a<strong> spoon</strong>.		
叱		scold	Recall some particularly harsh <b>scolding</b> you got as a child in school. This character has you <i>sitting on the ground</i> in the corner as your teacher stands over you, her <i>mouth</i> wide open as she reprimands you in front of the entire class.		5	477	2179	18	シツ、シチ	しか.る	A kid gets<strong> scold</strong>ed if they don't put the <em>spoon</em> properly into their <em>mouth</em> when eating.	Kids get<strong> scold</strong>ed if they don't open their MOUTH to take their SPOONFUL of medicine.	Here's a story I read many years ago in a magazine. It was about a girl who was lonely and wanting and decided to play with a banana. While doing this, she suddenly heard her parents returning home, and being startled, the banana broke inside her. Her mom then had to use a spoon to get the banana out of this poor girl while she was being <strong>scolded</strong>. So actually, this is a pictograph..	Well, how do you picture getting<strong> SCOLD</strong>ED? You listen to that MOUTH while you have to SIT DOWN there and take it.	"This is NOT spoon. The first stroke of the RHS goes beyond the second stroke. It's diced. STORY: When I try to make dinner, my wife<strong> scold</strong>s me because of my poor dicing technique. ""This is too big! It will never fit in our mouths! Dice it again!""."		
匂		aroma	"You will have to imagine ""capturing"" a favorite <b>aroma </b>by having it gagged and <i>bound up</i> in a <i>spoon</i>."		4	478	2147	18		にお.う、にお.い、にお.わせる	The BOUND UP SITTING MAN is going crazy because he can smell the<strong> aroma</strong> of fresh cinnamon buns, but can't get out of the ropes.	The muchacho <em>sits down bound up</em> to enjoy his own<strong> aroma</strong>.	The<strong> aroma</strong> of any delicacy is <em>bound up</em> in a <em>spoon</em>.	Your girlfriend comes up from behind you in bed on a cold winter's night and <em>spoons</em> you. She gets the blankets and tucks them in on both sides so the two of you are <em>bound up</em> tightly. Everything's perfect, until you release your foul<strong> aroma</strong> - silent but deadly, like a ninja.	"Note that 匂 （ におい） means good smell and 臭 （におい） <a href=""../v4/122.html"">stinking</a> (#122 臭) means bad smell. Story: Cheech/the muchacha (#451 渇) smells the<strong> aroma</strong> of tacos but he spent all his money on dope."		
頃		about that time	When Uncle Bob starts his comic routine of sticking <i>spoons </i>on his <i>head</i>, you know it is <b>about that time</b> to come up with a reason to excuse yourself.		11	479	2791	18	ケイ、キョウ	ころ、ごろ、しばら.く	An alarm clock with a unique design: You set it for, say, 7:00 am, and at<strong> about that time</strong> the clock reaches out with a <em>spoon</em> and hits you on the <em>head</em>.	After <em>spooning</em> for hours it's<strong> about that time</strong> he got some <em>head</em>. Dayum woman.	<strong>About that time</strong> to sit down and get some head.	子供の頃 I used to hit my HEAD with a SPOON.	When your host starts hitting himself on the <em>head</em> with a <em>spoon</em>, you realise it's <strong>about that time</strong> to make your excuses and leave! ( この頃 ).		
北		north	The cold air from the <b>north</b> is so strong that we see <i>two people sitting on the ground</i> back to back, their arms interlocked so they don't blow away. (Pay special attention to the drawing of the first 3 strokes.)		5	480	445	18	ホク	きた	<strong>Warning:</strong> The left part is NOT the primitive <em>turtle</em>! The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference!	In the<strong> north</strong>, the weather is so cold that people are often seen sitting back to back to preserve warmth.	Codexus wrote: <strong>Warning:</strong> The left part is NOT the primitive <em>turtle</em>! The stroke order is different.

My 'story': There are NO <em>turtles</em> at the <strong>North</strong> Pole. What looks like turtle-backs are actually Igloos, so small you can barely <em>sit</em> inside them.	The<strong> north</strong> is cold, so why doesn't this couple spoon to keep warm?	People! this has nothing to do with turtles. The strokes are different. Don't use turtle in this story.

背		stature	"One's <b>stature</b> is measured according to the ""<i>northern</i>-most"" <i>part of the body</i>."		9	481	446	18	ハイ	せ、せい、そむ.く、そむ.ける	While japanese people are generally small, people in the northern contryes have taller<strong> stature</strong> because of all the flesh they eat!	Up in the Great White <em>North</em>, we eat a lot of <em>meat</em> - thus giving us great<strong> STATURE</strong>. Mmmm…. baby seals.	Peter <em>North</em> is well known for his<strong> stature</strong>. You know, the size of his <em>flesh</em>.	"<strong>Stature</strong>/height has to do with how far ""NORTH""(upward?XD) your FLESH/BODY goes."	Your<strong> STATURE</strong> is measured from the <em>northern</em> most <em>part of your body</em>.		
比		compare	With <i>two spoons</i>, one in each hand, you are <b>comparing</b> your mother's cooking with your mother-in-law's.		4	482	447	18	ヒ	くら.べる	<strong>Compare</strong> the two spoons… the one on the left is funny-looking.	A gay couple about to turn around to <strong>compare</strong> which role is better…	"""Its like <strong>comparing</strong> apples and oranges,"" you say as you hold an apple in a spoon in one hand and an orange in a spoon in the other."	In the kitchen, <strong>compare</strong> the taste of the two dishes you're stirring with a <em>spoon</em> in each. Mmm!	<strong>Comparing</strong> cooking with two <em>spoons</em> - my mother's homemade in one spoon, and Philipino food, oddly enough, in the other. There's no comparison! (Note that this kanji can also be used for the Philipines).		
昆		descendants	"By <i>comparing</i> apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have <b>descended</b> from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything <b>descended</b> from everything else, one way or another, means that there is ""nothing new UNDER the <i>sun</i>."""		8	483	448	18	コン		Grandparent spends all DAY COMPARING photos of their<strong> DESCENDANTS</strong>.	Japanese people have compared themselves as being<strong> descendants</strong> of the sun. (Amaterasu, the sun godesss). Sun, comparing =<strong> descendants</strong>.	Ask a Japanese person what this kanji means, and they will surely spout 昆布 (konbu, seaweed)　and 昆虫 (konchu, insect) - but beyond that they will likely be mystified. Here's my best crack at it: imagine a grandfather watching his DESCENDENTS (grandkids) playing outside under the <em>sun</em>, silently <em>comparing</em> them, considering which of them will grow up and make him proud. Suddenly, grandma calls them in for a snack of 昆布 and for a re-application of repellent to keep the 昆虫 away.	My official rebuttal to racism: We're all<strong> descendants</strong> of the <em>sun</em> - there's no reason to <em>compare</em> us.	"We're all <strong>descendants</strong> of chimps, get over it, don't spend all <a href=""../v4/12.html"">day</a> (#12 日) trying to <a href=""../v4/447.html"">compare</a> (#447 比) various religious fairytales."		
皆		all	"Think of the housewives in TV commercials ""<i>comparing</i> the <i>whiteness</i>"" of their laundry across the fence, a typical advertisement for the popular detergent known as <b>All</b>.

Sometimes, Dr. Heisig's keyword choices are really quite bizarre. This doesn't mean<strong> all</strong>, it means <strong>everyone</strong>!! Picture two ku klux klansmen <em>comparing</em> whose <em>skin</em> is whiter…finally, they agree that <strong>everyone</strong> there is white.	<strong>皆</strong>さん、<strong>みんな</strong>さん, lets <strong>all</strong> <em>compare</em> our <em>whites</em>! This could be a line from a Japanese soap commercial or analysis the Republican presidential candidates…..	"If we <em>compare</em> ourselves to the perfect purity (the <em>whiteness</em>) that God demands of us, we see that ""<strong>all</strong> have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"" (Romans 3:23)."	<strong>All</strong> detergents claim that, when <em>comparing</em> to other brands, they produce the <em>whitest</em> laundry. But you can save lots of cash when you realize that they're <strong>all</strong> ok.		
楷		block letters	The key word refers to kanji that are written in full, squared form, as opposed to cursive writing which is more flowing andabbreviates some of the strokes. Here <b>block letters</b> are pictured as tidy rows of <i>trees</i> that are <i>all</i> the same size and can be read easily by <i>all</i>, whatever calligraphic skills they possess.		13	485	3011	18	カイ		"<strong>Print-style writing</strong> (as opposed to cursive): <em>All</em> <strong>print-style writing</strong> looks rather <em>wooden</em> to me. I prefer the fancy curves of cursive. (Note: Heisig gives this character the official keyword ""block letters,"" but based on what I've read about the meaning of the character in the Yahoo! Japan Dictionary, I prefer ""print-style writing"")."	<strong>Block letters</strong> (as opposed to cursive) are rigid and lifeless like <em>wood</em>; they're <em>all</em> the same size so that <em>all</em> can read them.	"<em>all</em> the hiragana are in ""block letters"" on <em>wooden</em> blocks, like children's toys."	Literally the <strong>block letters</strong> on children's blocks, carved into <em>wood</em> so clearly that <em>all</em> can read them.	"At the base of the tree, in white<strong> block letters</strong> is written the following; ""In 1911, 3 men sat here and compared the whiteness of their skins. In the end it was determined that they were all white.""."		
諧		orderliness	"The harmoney of ""a place for everything and everything in its place"" is applied here to the <b>orderliness</b> of <i>all</i> the <i>words</i> one speaks."		16	486	3012	18	カイ	かな.う、 やわ.らぐ	<strong>harmonious</strong>: If a choir is to be <strong>harmonious</strong>, <em>all</em> the voices need to combine to hit the right notes, and say the right <em>words</em>.	Think of a chat in which <em>everyone</em> is writing <em>words</em> at once, of the lack of<strong> orderliness</strong> of such a chat.	To have<strong> orderliness</strong>, your <em>words</em> must be in <em>all</em> the right places.	起立 (きりつ)！ Hearing these <em>words</em>, <em>all</em> the students immediately stand at attention. The <strong>orderliness</strong> of classes in Japan is incredible.	"<strong>to be in sync</strong>: The <em>words</em> a choir sings must <em>all</em> <strong>be in sync</strong>. ~~~ (Note: According to Yahoo! 辞書 , this character means something like ""to harmonize/to mitigate."" I chose <strong>to be in sync</strong> as the keyword to both avoid conflicting with other keywords and to capture the general meaning of the kanji that can be applied to the various compounds that use it.)."		
混		mix	<b>Mixed</b> marriages, this character suggests, <i>water</i> down the quality of one's <i>descendants</i> - the oldest racial nonsense in the world!		11	487	450	18	コン	ま.じる、-ま.じり、ま.ざる、ま.ぜる、こ.む	People have to<strong> mix</strong> their fluids (have sex), in order to create descendants.	<strong>Mixed</strong> kids are <em>watered</em> down <em>descendants</em>. But often the most attractive!	<strong>God's recipe for Life:</strong> <em>1 spoonful of water (raw material); 1 spoonful of sunlight (energy)</em>.<strong> MIX</strong> thoroughly, and let stand very briefly. Don't let it sit for too long after<strong> mix</strong>ing (a few million years), or the<strong> mix</strong> may destroy itself, the<strong> mix</strong>ing bowl, and possibly the entire kitchen.	It was a<strong> MIX</strong> of elements, happened millions of years ago, that created the first bacterias in the WATER. From them we are DESCENDANTS.	Our <strong>WATER DESCENDANTS</strong> (i.e., mermaids), are a<strong> mix</strong> of man and fish.		
渇		thirst	As you pass by the muchacho taking the <i>siesta</i>, he cries out that he is <b>thirsty</b> and asks for something to drink. So you turn the <i>water</i> hose on him.		11	488	451	18	カツ	かわ.く	You awaken from your <em>siesta</em> because you feel extremely <strong>thirst</strong>y so you go looking for some <em>water</em>.	The muchacho taking his SIESTA cries out that he is<strong> THIRST</strong>Y. So you pull out a bottle of WATER and pretend you're going to give it to him…but then you dump it all on the ground before his eyes. HAHA, sucked in muchacho!!	"This whole series is easy to me if you picture Cheech as the man taking the Siesta. ""He man, you gotta drinka water man? I am like so<strong> thirst</strong>y I could die man.""."	If anyone is having difficulty creating stories with the primitive <em>siesta</em>, try changing it to <em>beggar</em> - a <em>beggar</em> sits in his box begging for food/money under a hot sun. I have used <em>beggar</em> as a primitive in several frames and it works like a charm. Here a <em>beggar</em> develops a deep<strong> thirst</strong> for <em>water</em> as he crouches in his box under the hot sun.	Have some <em>water</em> before you take a <em>siesta</em>, or you will wake up<strong> thirst</strong>y!		
謁		audience	Imagine an <b>audience</b> with the emperor or the pope in which all those in attendance are sitting down, leaning against the wall, sleeping like our muchacho on <i>siesta</i> as the honorable host delivers his <i>speech</i>.		15	489	452	18	エツ		The <em>talk</em> was so boring the<strong> audience</strong> took a <em>siesta</em>.	"Note: The keyword meaning is ""Have an<strong> audience</strong> with . . . (Pope, King, etc)"". Story: When you arrive for your<strong> audience</strong> with the Pope, he appears to be dozing. His assistant says, ""Sorry about your<strong> audience</strong>, but you won't get a <em>word</em> out of him while he's having his <em>siesta</em>""."	The man talking during his siesta (in his sleep) is saying strange things and drawing an<strong> audience</strong>.	A good<strong> audience</strong> doesn't <em>talk</em> or take a <em>siesta</em>.	The Pope granted an<strong> AUDIENCE</strong> to the entire Mexican village, but since he didn't <em>talk</em> in Spanish, it quickly turned into a mass <em>siesta</em>.		
褐		brown	The color of the serape or <i>cloak</i> of our muchacho on <i>siesta</i> is a dull <b>brown</b>, the color this kanji indicates.		13	490	453	18	カツ		Why is my package late? Imagine a UPS driver dressed in<strong> BROWN</strong> <em>garments</em> taking a <em>siesta</em>. What can<strong> BROWN</strong> do for you?	Mexicans use a <em>cloak</em> (pancho) for their <em>siestas</em>. Their color is usually<strong> brown</strong>.	"The hobbits from ""The Lord of the Rings"" just had to crawl under their<strong> brown</strong> <em>cloaks</em> and they could take a <em>siesta</em>."	"Cheech, ""Oh jeez, I Shit myself man! Now my clothes are all<strong> brown</strong> man…""."	"If you break up SIESTA into <em>tongue wagging in mouth</em>, <em>bound up</em>, <em>sitting man</em>, you have somewhat the image of a prisoner begging. This gives you the general sense of <em>BEGGAR</em>. Using <em>BEGGAR</em> as a primitive is better I think. A <a href=""../v4/451.html"">thirst</a> (#451 渇) beggar begs for water. A beggar speaks requesting an <a href=""../v4/452.html"">audience</a> (#452 謁)(to beg for money), a <em>BEGGAR'S GARMENTS</em> are usually<strong> brown</strong>(dirty), and beggars sleep so much when they open their mouth, their voice is <a href=""../v4/454.html"">hoarse</a> (#454 喝).

喝		hoarse	When the muchacho on <i>siesta</i> looks up at you and opens his <i>mouth</i> to talk, his voice is so <b>hoarse</b> that you cannot understand him.		11	491	454	18	カツ		If you have a <em>siesta</em> with your <em>mouth</em>open, you will wake up with a<strong> hoarse</strong> voice.	After taking a siesta, you find that your mouth is<strong> hoarse</strong> (after all you ARE thirsty remember).	When you are<strong> hoarse</strong>, it's time for your <em>mouth</em> to have a <em>siesta</em>. (I don't like relating this to thirst, mixed them up a few times).	"Cheech's voice is always<strong> hoarse</strong>. Cheech, ""Hey man you seen what happened to my mouth man? I can't talk right man.""."	"If you break up SIESTA into <em>tongue wagging in mouth</em>, <em>bound up</em>, <em>sitting man</em>, you have somewhat the image of a prisoner begging.

葛		kudzu	"<b>Kudzu</b> is a word taken over from Japanese to name the crawling vines that creep up and completely take over trees. Seeing it at its worst in the Georgia countryside makes it easy to understand why it has a reputation as the ""plague of the South."" From there it should not be hard to arrange the primitives, <i>flowers</i> and <i>siesta</i> into a memorable image."		11	492	2398	18	カツ、カチ	つづら、くず	Flower, siesta: The muchacho was not careful. He passed the warning signs and decided to hold a <em>siesta</em> in the<strong> kudzu</strong> field. The<strong> kudzu</strong> grew so fast, he was completely covered by it in a few hours and not able to escape. Now, the<strong> kudzu</strong> <em>flowers</em> mark his grave.	The muchacho takes a <em>siesta</em> under the <em>flowers</em> of the<strong> kudzu</strong>.	<strong>Kudzu</strong> is a <em>flowering</em> plant that never takes a <em>siesta</em>…it grows constantly and has already overtaken most of the southeastern United States. Beware the<strong> kudzu</strong>!	Ok so I don't know about anyone else, but the bottom part of this kanji does not look like <em>siesta</em> on this site. In the supplement pdf it does, but not here so I came up with this:<strong> Kudzu</strong> vines and <em>flowers</em> grow so fast by <em>day</em> that by night they have <em>bound up</em> all the <em>animal legs</em> in the forest like <em>fish hooks</em> bind fish. It is long and convoluted, but it contains everything similar to the elements here.	"My Windows font is displaying the traditional form of this character, however the bottom primitive is <em>siesta</em> as listed. A couple of links to confirm: <a href=""http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/845b/browsertest.htm"">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/845b/browsertest.htm</a> <a href=""http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E8%91%9B"">http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E8%91%9B</a> Also I'd never heard of<strong> kudzu</strong> before, so thought I might as well rename this to <strong>くず</strong> and learn the reading too."		
旨		delicious	Something is so downright <b>delicious</b> that one spends the entire <i>day</i> with a <i>spoon</i> in hand gobbling it up.		6	493	455	18	シ	むね、うま.い	Use a <em>spoon</em> to eat a<strong> DELICIOUS</strong> hot fudge <em>sun</em>dae. Duh..	It's sooo<strong> delicious</strong> I could <em>spoon</em> it in all <em>day</em>.	Instructions for <strong>delicious</strong>: 1. Find said <strong>delicious</strong> 2. Get <em>spoon</em> 3. Spend all <em>day</em> eating.	In Japan, you basically have to <em>wag your tongue</em> after each <em>spoonful</em> you eat in order to talk about how<strong> delicious</strong> the food is. To learn this just watch Japanese television, on basically any channel, for 15 minutes. Girls say 'oishii', but guys usually use 'umai,' which is written with this very kanji: 旨い (うまい).	That girl was so<strong> delicious</strong> I could spoon her all day :P.		
脂		fat	This kanji tells us that if you feed the <i>flesh</i> with too many <i>delicious</i> things, it soon picks up a thick layer of <b>fat</b>.		10	494	456	18	シ	あぶら	Every chef will tell you,<strong> fat</strong> is what make the meat taste delicious.	"<strong>Fat</strong> is the most <em>delicious</em> part of the <em>flesh</em>. (Note this refers to physical<strong> fat</strong>, not the concept of obesity <a href=""../v4/494.html"">obese</a> (#494 肪))."	Well, after months with nothing else but delicious food - of course you get<strong> fat</strong>!	Delicious SUNdaes will put some<strong> fat</strong> on your FLESH.	Think of the famous kobe beef: why is its <em>flesh</em> so <em>delicious</em>? Why, it is so finely marbled with<strong> fat</strong>!		
詣		visit a shrine	"Here you ""savor your <i>words</i>"" as something <i>delicious</i> when you describe your recent <b>visit to a shrine</b> or pilgrimage site."		13	495	2715	18	ケイ、ゲイ	けい.する、まい.る、いた.る、もう.でる	You<strong> visit a shrine</strong> to <em>say</em> your wishes and offer <em>delicious</em> offering to the gods.	"To fat, effete Japanophiles (cheerily munching on 肉まん in the back of the tour bus) hearing the <em>words</em> of the tour guide ""Now we will<strong> visit a shrine</strong>"" elicits squeals of joy. ""Oooooh, how absolutely <em>delicious</em>!""."	On New Year's Day, Japanese people usually read the <em>words</em> written on their New Year's cards (nengajou - 年賀状 ), eat <em>delicious</em> special New Year's foods and<strong> visit a shrine</strong> to pray for good luck in the coming year (thx mantixen).	As a man of reason, <em>Socrates</em> knows the only reason to<strong> visit a shrine</strong> is for the <em>delicious</em> food.	The only reason for me to <strong>visit a shrine</strong> is to see those <em>deliciously</em> young shrine maidens. Oh, did I <em>say</em> that out loud?		
壱		I (one)	"The Roman numeral I - like that for II we met earlier in frame 379 - is only rarely used now.

The samurai who has been crowned number one is so good he uses a spoon to fight with rather than a sword.

Freud believed<strong> every</strong> man wants to <em>lie down</em> with his <em>mother</em> (see decameron)– AND he asked<strong> every</strong> one of his patients to recline on the sofa and talk about his Mom.	<strong>Every</strong> MAMA deserves to RECLINE and have a good rest.		
敏		cleverness	Behind <i>every</i> successful <i>taskmaster</i>, the <b>cleverness</b> of a fox to outwit his charges.		10	498	459	18	ビン	さとい	Every master(or taskmaster) must have some degree of<strong> cleverness</strong>.	<strong>Cleverness</strong> is something <em>every</em> <em>taskmaster</em> must have. <em>Every</em> <em>taskmaster</em> has<strong> cleverness</strong>.

They do. Orange trees, apple trees, cantaloupe trees.<strong> Plum</strong>s are simply mutant fruits that have been installed in the root software of every single tree. I hear that some<strong> plum</strong>-loving scientists are working on a way to hack <em>every</em> <em>tree's</em> genetic code so that <em>every tree</em> will bear nothing <em>but</em><strong> plum</strong>s.	<em>every</em> man's <em>wood</em> has 2<strong> plum</strong>s.

The homeless man <em>lying</em> on the street with a <em>hook</em> for an arm<strong> beg</strong>ged us for anything we could spare.		
乾		drought	In times of <b>drought</b> anything at all will do. Here we see the victims <i>begging</i> for just a little <i>mist</i> for relief.		11	502	463	18	カン、ケン	かわ.く、かわ.かす、ほ.す、ひ.る、いぬい	During a <strong>drought</strong>, everything <em>begs</em> for even a <em>mist</em> for relief.	During a <strong>drought</strong>, even <em>mist</em> is <em>begged</em> for.	Beggar has to drink mist because there is no water in the<strong> drought</strong>. I get this one confused with thirst 451 but try to remember that there is no water element beacuse it is a<strong> drought</strong>.	The beggar is licking the ten sunflowers to get some moisture from the mist. Why? It has been a<strong> drought</strong>.	<em>Ten sunflowers</em> <em>begged</em> the rain gods for even a drip of mist, for there had been a<strong> drought</strong>.		
腹		abdomen	If you <i>double back</i> (fold over) most animals - or people, for that matter - in the middle, the <i>part of the body</i> where the crease comes is the <b>abdomen</b>.		13	503	464	18	フク	はら	The only <strong>body</strong> part that <strong>doubles over</strong>.	Imagine getting punched in the<strong> abdomen</strong>, a fairly tender part of <em>flesh</em>, and instead of doubling forward, you <em>double back</em>. That would be pretty painful.	The <em>part of the body (flesh)</em> that is exercised when we lie down and bring our <em>walking legs</em> toward the <em>sun</em> is the<strong> abdomen</strong> (aka: leglifts).	"Try not to confuse the primitive 'double back' and <a href=""../v4/1130.html"">fold</a> (#1130 折). After I <em>backtracked</em> from a long day of hiking, my <strong>abdomen</strong> was hungry for <em>flesh</em>, so I ate a huge steak."	Well, flesh doubled over..and over .. think of the guts …in the<strong> abdomen</strong>.		
複		duplicate	In its original and etymologically transparent sense, to <b>duplicate</b> something means to <i>double</i> it <i>back</i> with a fold, like the fold of a <i>cloak</i>.		14	504	465	18	フク		My girlfiend saw someone wearing the exact same (duplicate) outfit at a party, so she doubled back to change!	"In <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, Hermione uses a device called a ""time-turner"" to <em>double back</em> in time, but this creates<strong> duplicate</strong>s. The smart thing to do would be to combine Hermione's time-turner with Harry's invisibility cloak. That way, one could <em>double back</em> in time without creating any visible<strong> duplicate</strong>s."	The magician took his CLOAK, FOLDED IT (DOUBLE BACKED IT) and <strong>DUPLICATED</strong> it!! Amaaaazing.	St. Martin took his <em>cloak</em>, <em>doubled it back</em>, and cut it into two pieces effectively making a<strong> duplicate</strong> of his cape (duplicape) for the beggar.	My girlfriend noticed that someone was wearing an exact<strong> duplicate</strong> of the <em>cloak</em> she was told was one of a kind! So, she <em>laid</em> there, <em>tongue wagging</em>, <em>legs</em> kicking throwing a right hissy fit![[I have trouble remembering 'double back'.. hope this helps anyone else who has the same problem! Also, thanks to akimoto for the girlfriend story]].		
欠		lack	The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone yawning. The first stroke shows the head thrown back; the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth; and the last two, the legs. Since yawning shows a <b>lack</b> of something (psychologically, interest; physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see.	* As a primitive, it can mean either <i>yawn</i> or <i>lack</i>.	4	505	466	18	ケツ、ケン	か.ける、か.く、あくび	To me, this kanji looks like a person with two arms and two legs, but who<strong> lack</strong>s a head.	When your body<strong> lack</strong>s oxygen you <em>yawn</em>.	A PERSON BOUND UP due to work is tired and<strong> LACK</strong>S sleep, hence YAWNS.	I <em>yawn</em> when I<strong> lack</strong> interest.	A <em>bound up</em> <em>person</em><strong> lack</strong>s his freedom.		
吹		blow	To <b>blow</b> is really no more than a deliberate effort to make one's <i>mouth lack</i> all the air that is in it.		7	506	467	18	スイ	ふ.く	This is clearly a<strong> BLOW</strong>JOB, we can see the MOUTH and the LACK OF condom. (I am sorry for the image, but it sticks forever in your mind).	How am I supposed to<strong> BLOW</strong> if I <em>lack</em> a <em>mouth</em>? (Imagine a kid at his own birthday party, and - like Neo in the Matrix - had no oriface where his mouth was to be. And yet, the people cruelly cheer him on to<strong> blow</strong> out his candles…).	"I keep confusing this with <a href=""../v4/689.html"">suck</a> (#689 吸). Consider someone<strong> blow</strong>ing bubbles using their chewing gum because they're <em>lack</em>ing attention in class."	After your <em>mouth opens</em> and you <em>yawn</em>, you<strong> BLOW</strong> out a lot of air.	<strong>Blowing</strong> makes your <em>mouth</em> <em>lack</em> air.		
炊		cook	Better to picture what happens when you do not pay attention to your work in the kitchen. Here we see a blazing <i>fire</i> and an inattentive, <i>yawning</i> <b>cook</b> who let things get out of control.		8	507	468	18	スイ	た.く、-だ.き	Japanese<strong> cook</strong>ing sometimes <em>lacks</em> <em>fire</em>, e.g., sashimi.	This character shows the difference between a <strong>cook</strong> and a chef: a chef prepares food with passion and love; a <strong>cook</strong> only stands there with a pan over a <em>fire</em>, with no passion and just <em>yawning</em>.	How can you<strong> cook</strong> something when you lack fire?	This is the first kanji for rice<strong> cook</strong>er ( 炊飯器 ). The reason they came up with that device is the sheer amount of incidents of people's morning rice going up in flames while they were yawning, trying to keep awake.	"Tip : if you have seen Hayao Miyazaki 's animated movie ""Howl's moving castle"" (Le Château Ambulant), you may use the image of the flame demon Calcifer for the fire primitive. Somewhere in the first part of the movie, after Sophie arrives at the castle, she tries to<strong> cook</strong> some ham with the help of <em>Calcifer (the flame demon)</em> but he just complains and <em>yawns</em>!"		
歌		song	The <b>song</b> in this kanji is being sung by a chorus line of <i>can-can</i> girls. Why it should be eliciting nothing but <i>yawning</i> from the audience, I leave to you to decide.		14	508	469	18	カ	うた、うた.う	<strong>Can-Can</strong>-ers <strong>lack</strong> the ability to sing a <strong>song</strong>, so they just dance.	<em>Can-can</em> dancers are supposed to be big-bosomed girls who dance. Yet these so called can-can dancers are flat-chested and singing a<strong> song</strong>, so audience of men is <em>yawn</em>ing in boredom.	"Do you know the ""Obama<strong> song</strong>""? It goes like: ""Yes we <em>can</em>, yes we <em>can</em>!"" The problem is, the lyrics repeat so often that everybody starts <em>yawning</em> sooner or later. - This is no political comment ;-)."	Modern<strong> SONG</strong>stresses have <em>doubly-nice CANs</em>, but <em>LACK</em> true musical talent.	"The Idol contestants think ""I CAN I CAN SING THIS<strong> SONG</strong>"" but most of them LACK talent."		
軟		soft	If the cushions of one's <i>car</i> are too <b>soft</b>, one may begin <i>yawning</i> at the wheel.		11	509	470	18	ナン	やわ.らか、やわ.らかい	Cars are rough steel things, lacking<strong> soft</strong>ness.	If your <em>car</em> has really<strong> soft</strong> seats, you may start <em>yawning</em> and eventually fall asleep at the wheel (imagine that this seat is a huge<strong> soft</strong> beanbag that nearly swallows the driver, and it will be easier to remember).	Someday, they will invent<strong> SOFT</strong> <strong>cars</strong>. The <strong>cars</strong> will be so safe that accidents will become no big deal. (Imagine drivers <strong>yawning</strong> as their cars crash into each other and bounce harmlessly away).	If you play<strong> SOFT</strong> rock in the CAR while driving, you'll soon start YAWNING.	A<strong> soft</strong>ener commercial, but with anthropomorphized <em>cars</em> (similar to Pixar's Cars for example). The little baby <em>car</em> is wrapped in some kind of<strong> soft</strong> fabric and <em>yawning</em>. So cute!		
次		next	"This key word connotes the ""<b>next</b> in line"" of a succession of people or things. Let there be a <i>lack</i> of <i>ice</i> on the hottest day of summer, and you stand impatiently in line waiting for the distributor to call out ""<b>Next</b>!"""	* As a primitive, this character can either retain its key word meaning of <i>next</i> or the related meaning of <i>second</i>.	6	510	471	18	ジ、シ	つ.ぐ、つぎ	Is this store <em>lack</em>ing <em>ice</em>? Let's try the<strong> next</strong> one, then.	"A rapper called ""Ice"" went for auditions but was told he lacked talent.<strong> Next</strong>…"	A lack of ice is the<strong> next</strong> phase of global warming.	"Global warming has gotten extreme. You're sweltering in line at the ice rationing board. Every few minutes the sullen clerk yawns and says ""next"", and someone shuffles forward to get their ice cube."	The<strong> next</strong> time you <em>yawn</em>, I'm going to put <em>ice</em> down your shirt to wake you up!		
茨		briar	"Earlier we made mention of the story of <b>Briar</b> Rose (or ""Sleeping Beauty,"" as we called her in frame 165) and drew attention to the <b>briar</b> hedge that grew up all about her castle. But in the <i>second</i> part of the story, these <b>briars</b> blossomed into <i>flowers</i>. Hence her name, <b>Briar</b> Rose. Be careful not to confuse this character with that for <i>thorn</i> (Frame 446)."		9	511	472	18	シ、ジ	いばら、かや、くさぶき	To prevent animals from eating the beautiful flowers in your garden, the best thing to do is to plant<strong> briar</strong> bushes immediately <em>next</em> to them.	The<strong> briar</strong> patch may look unremarkable now before it blooms, but there will be <em>flowers</em> <em>next</em>, and it will be beautiful.	Once you plant your <em>flowers</em>, what inevitably come up <em>next</em> are<strong> briar</strong>s.	An important life lesson:<strong> Briar</strong>s are always <em>NEXT</em> to <em>FLOWERS</em>.	<strong>Briar</strong>s are the kind of <em>flowers</em> that comes up <em>next</em> after a property is abandoned….it's an ecological succession.		
資		assets	The first <i>shells</i> (money) you earn, you use to pay your debts. From then on, the <i>next shells</i> you accumulate become your <b>assets</b>.		13	512	473	18	シ		<strong>Assets</strong> are the next best thing to money.	The first SHELLS you get you obviously spend, but the NEXT SHELLS are your<strong> ASSETS</strong>, you should bury them in a low safe place (placement!).	I invest my<strong> assets</strong> in NEXTEL and SHELL.	"""I've already taken your<strong> assets</strong>!"" says your ex-wife, adding ""<em>Next</em>, I'm taking your <em>money</em>!"" as she walks away with a satisfied grin on her face."	The topless model was concerned about protecting her<strong> ASSETS</strong> so she went to <em>Next</em> (British high street clothes shop) and bought a tasteful pair of colourful <em>shells</em>. <em>Next</em> she stood outside in the street, with the sign for <em>Next</em> clearly visible over her head, and fixed them in position with chewing gum.		
姿		figure	This kanji depicts a <i>woman's</i> <b>figure</b> as a sort of <i>second</i> self.		9	513	474	18	シ	すがた	The next woman always has a better<strong> figure</strong>! Thinking like that, you'll end up alone in an old folks home longing for the good old days!	Whenever I am <em>next</em> to a <em>woman</em>, I can't help but take notice of her<strong> figure</strong>.	The <em>next</em> <em>woman</em> always has a better<strong> figure</strong> ! Thinking like this is a burden weighing down many women. - (Thanks to alantin, but the last statement helps me get the placement right - it always used to be a problem with this kanji).	First you see her<strong> FIGURE</strong>, NEXT you get to know the WOMAN behind the curves.	When i am next to a woman, i imagine her<strong> figure</strong> under me =D.		
諮		consult with	To seek the <i>words</i> of a <i>second mouth</i> is to <b>consult with</b> someone about something.		16	514	475	18	シ	はか.る	Having a <em>word</em> with the <em>next mouth</em> over, like a neighbor, is usually a good way to<strong> consult with</strong> somebody for cheap. Because, you know, actual consultants charge huge sums.	"""Consulting with"" is having <em>words</em> with the <em>next mouth</em>."	Don't like the <em>words</em> of the first one?<strong> Consult with</strong> the <em>next mouth</em> available.	If you've ever had to deal with <strong>consultants</strong> in business, you'll find that once you bring in one, there's always a reason to drag in more; a real drain on your resources. So I see this as the constant steam of <em>words</em> from the <em>next mouth</em>, all telling you that you need more <strong>conultants</strong>.	Tim Allen always used to <em>speak</em> and<strong> consult with</strong> his <em>next</em> door neighbor, Wilson. You could never see Wilson's whole face, just his <em>mouth</em>.		
賠		compensation	Picture a <i>clam</i> used as a <i>muzzle</i> to quiet the complaints of a fisherman's widow asking <b>compensation</b> for her husband lost at sea.		15	515	476	19	バイ		<strong>Compensation</strong> is money you give to someone to shut them up (i.e. muzzle their mouth).	<strong>Compensation</strong> is a kind of euphemism for hush money here. Money that <em>muzzles</em>.	I expect<strong> compensation</strong> for the bite I recieved when you didn't <em>muzzle</em> your dog.	"In ""compensated dating"", Japanese girls earn <em>shells</em> from oyaji. The oyajis' members <em>stand</em> at attention and the girls use their <em>mouths</em> to earn their<strong> compensation</strong>."	When I see this keyword I think of 'compensated dating' (AKA enjo kosai). A man hands over his <em>money</em> to the girl and then <em>stands up</em>, and she then opens up her <em>mouth</em> to <strong>compensate</strong> him. If that girl's parents want to fix her problem, they are going to need to put a <em>muzzle</em> on her!		
培		cultivate	The barrel hoops used by many Japanese farmers to stretch clear plastic over row of vegetables in a garden patch in the hopes of <b>cultivating</b> bigger and bigger vegetables is a way of <i>muzzling</i> the <i>soil</i>.		11	516	477	19	バイ	つちか.う	To<strong> cultivate</strong> the <em>land</em> is to tame it, control it. In short, you <em>muzzle</em> it's unruly, chaotic nature. 培う つちかう to<strong> cultivate</strong>, to foster; 栽培 (さいばい) : cultivation.	The illegal immigrants<strong> cultivate</strong> the <em>land</em> but are socially and politically <em>muzzled</em> (wear muzzles while they work too).	In olden times the <em>land (soil)</em> was<strong> cultivate</strong>d by farmers who were <em>muzzled</em> by the land owners: they were prevented from expressing their opinions.	The SOIL is MUZZLED to stop it screaming as it is<strong> CULTIVATE</strong>D (torn up with blades).	Image people <strong>cultivating</strong> , <em>standing in a hole in the ground</em>, preparing the soil to receive the next crop.		
剖		divide	"To ""<b>divide</b> and conquer"" you use a <i>saber</i> and a <i>muzzle</i>."		10	517	478	19	ボウ		When you<strong> DIVIDE</strong> someone, there is sure to be a lot of screaming. That's why you should use a MUZZLE before using the SABER.	<strong>Divide</strong> and Conquer: Shut 'em Up and Cut 'em Up.	<strong>Divide</strong> and conquer - first you cut them up (saber) , then you shut them up (muzzle).	The two women keep arguing about whose baby it is. So Solomon muzzles the both of them, pulls out a sword, and prepares to<strong> divide</strong> the child between the two.	In order to MUZZLE the two complaining women, Solomon offered to<strong> divide</strong> the child with a SABER.		
音		sound	The kanji for <b>sound</b> depicts something <i>standing</i> in the air over a <i>tongue wagging in a mouth</i>, much the same as a <b>sound</b> does for the briefest of moments before disappearing.	* The primitive from this kanji also means simply a sound.	9	518	479	19	オン、イン、ノン	おと、ね	If you were standing on the sun, believe me, you'd be making<strong> sound</strong>.	The <em>tongue wagging in a mouth</em> produces a very high-pitched <strong>sound</strong>, breaking a nearby <em>vase</em>.	Imagine the<strong> SOUND</strong>s a woman makes as she is STANDing above a WAGGING TOUNGE.	Note that<strong> sound</strong> is very close to the <strong>muzzle</strong> primitive (it has the <em>sun</em> instead of the <em>mouth</em> at the bottom) - but in meaning they are precisely opposite!	I STAND UP every DAY to the<strong> SOUND</strong> of [insert<strong> sound</strong> here].		
暗		darkness	"When ""<b>darkness</b> covered the earth"" at the beginning of time, there was neither <i>sun</i> nor <i>sound</i>."		13	519	480	19	アン	くら.い、くら.む、くれ.る	Picture the sun exploding - there would be a gigantic noise and then…nothing. Everything would plunge into<strong> darkness</strong>.	"In places of complete <strong>darkness</strong>, such as caves where the <em>sun</em> can't reach, creatures such as bats have learned to navigate by <em>sound</em> rather than sight. The poor guys must have to fly around screaming ""Marco!"" and ""Polo!"" all the time."	Total<strong> darkness</strong> lacks <em>sun</em> and <em>sound</em>.	In the <strong>darkness</strong> of that dank solitary confinement cell, all you can do is fantasize about <em>sun</em> and <em>sound</em>.	"Heisig was careless with his story for <a href=""../v4/240.html"">silence</a> (#240 黙). i have a really hard time confusing it for this one now."		
韻		rhyme	"Poetry restricted to verses that <b>rhyme</b> often finds it has to abandon clarity of thought in order to make the <b>rhyme</b> of the words work. In this kanji's picture, one becomes a kind of ""<i>sound-employee</i>."""		19	520	481	19	イン		What is a<strong> RHYME</strong> but some SOUND that EMPLOYEES say to get them through work.	"Dr Seuss's <em>employee</em> finally rebels against him: ""I'm tired of odd <em>sounds</em> all the time, I will not, cannot, speak in<strong> RHYME</strong>!""."	A<strong> rhyme</strong> is the <em>sound</em> of an <em>employee</em> going off to work. Everyone knows that ever since 'Snow White' in 1937 all employees sing 'hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go' (because it's so catchy! And it's so catchy because 'ho'<strong> rhyme</strong>s with 'go'!).	"""<em>Sound</em> as a pound"" is a<strong> rhyme</strong> that fits the kanji. <em>Sound</em> + pound. Pounds being what you make when you're an <em>employee</em> (living in the UK that is)."	Employees of The Ministry of Sound are paid to<strong> rhyme</strong> every day.		
識		discriminating	A person of <b>discriminating</b> intellect can tell the difference between mere <i>kazoo</i>-buzzing and <i>words</i> spoken wisely.		19	521	482	19	シキ	し.る、しる.す	<em>Words</em> are difficult to discriminate/discern from <em>sounds</em> in the middle of a <em>fiesta</em>.	I have<strong> discriminating</strong> taste. I'd rather listen to the <em>words</em> of a lecture than attend a <em>kazoo</em> concert. (Picture some snobby guy in a tweed jacket turning up his nose at entering a loud raucous kazoo recital).	I wonder why Heisig didn't use <strong>discernment</strong> for this kanji. It fits the meaning equally and it is not as loaded as <strong>discrimination</strong>. // It is quite hard to <strong>discern</strong> <em>words</em> in the middle of a <em>noisy fiesta</em>.	<strong>Discriminating</strong> someone's <em>words</em> from other sounds is hard to do in the middle of a <em>noisy fiesta</em>. (Thanks esaulgd).	Socrates has apparently joined the KKK, and is actively<strong> discriminating</strong> against Black people. But to add a bit of artistic flair, as the ancient Greeks were wont to do, he says his racist words through a kazoo. <em>Socrates</em> humming the n-<em>word</em> through a <em>kazoo</em> - who would have thought?		
鏡		mirror	After lakes but before glass, polished <i>metal</i> was used for <b>mirrors</b>. These <i>metal mirrors</i> are recalled in this character for a <b>mirror</b>.		19	522	483	19	キョウ、ケイ	かがみ	<strong>Mirror</strong> should suggest vanity. Imagine a spoiled girl who gets her parents to buy her a <em>Golden</em><strong> mirror</strong> so she can <em>stand</em> in front of it all <em>day</em> vainly admiring her lovely <em>human legs</em>.	"The <em>metal</em><strong> mirror</strong> makes a <em>sound</em> - it's answering the question ""who has the fairest <em>human legs</em> of all?""."	<em>metal + stand up + sun + legs </em> remember the legend of <strong>Amaterasu</strong> who retired in a cave. the other Gods brought a <strong>MIRROR</strong> made of polished <strong> METAL</strong> at the entrance of the cave. Amaterasu who was <strong>STANDING UP</strong> saw her image of the <strong>SUN </strong> and began to dance with her <strong>LEGS</strong>.	"Remember how Archimedes burnt an approaching fleet with<strong> mirror</strong>s?<strong> Mirror</strong>s then were <em>metal</em> and the sailors must have thought: ""What're those <em>metal </em> things up there, <em>standing</em> on the city walls? They look like <em>little suns</em> on <em>human legs</em>. Warm today isn't it?""."	"WARNING: Be extra careful not to confuse the <em>sun/tongue-wagging mouth</em> and <em>human legs</em> part of the<strong> mirror</strong> primitive with 見 <a href=""../v4/57.html"">see</a> (#57 見)."		
境		boundary	Imagine the <b>boundary</b> of a plot of <i>land</i> marked with gigantic <i>mirrors</i> enabling the landowner to keep trespassers in sight at all times.		14	523	484	19	キョウ、ケイ	さかい	In the dense cities of Japan even a small garden is a luxury. In this house, the owner has put <em>mirrors</em> on the<strong> boundary</strong> of his <em>land</em> so it feels much bigger.	This is an old trick to keep out migrants. You put a bunch of dirty mirrors on the<strong> boundary</strong> of your land and theirs. When they approach the<strong> boundary</strong>, what they see in the mirror is their own land and someone that looks like themselves, only dirtier, so they figure your country isn't any better than their own and they head back home.	<strong>Boundaries</strong> and borders (another meaning of this kanji) used to be protected by daggers and swords (see <strong>environs</strong>, frame 284); but today our <em>lands</em> are protected by one-way <em>mirrors</em> at airport customs with video cameras and interrogation rooms behind them.	In Japan, you often see MIRRORS at intersections. That's because the walls that form the<strong> boundary</strong> of people's LAND make it hard to see around corners.	"Be aware the right-hand character 竟 really means ""endpoint"" or ""finally""; it's commonly read ""つい"" (as in ""ついに"") and usually written in kana alone. A<strong> boundary</strong> represents a country's <em>land</em>'s <em>endpoint</em> (awkward phrasing for order) ."		
亡		deceased	A <i>top hat</i> hanging on a <i>hook</i> in the front hall, right where the <b>deceased</b> left it the day he died, reminds us of him and his kanji.	* In addition to <i>deceased</i>, the primitive meaning of <i>to perish</i> will also be used for this character.	3	524	485	19	ボウ、モウ	な.い、な.き-、ほろ.びる、ほろ.ぶ、ほろ.ぼす	The <em>top hat</em> hanging on a <em>hook</em> belonged to the now<strong> deceased</strong> Charlie Chaplin.	The recently<strong> DECEASED</strong> are said to hang their <em>hats</em> on a <em>hook</em> by the door to the afterlife.	Tophat resting on top of a tombstone. The horizontal bottom line is the shadow of the tombstone (and/or hat) on the ground.	I think of this as a pictograph of a coffin.	The <strong>deceased</strong>'s <em>top hat</em> still hangs on his old <em>fish hook</em>… It makes me sad every time I see it, but I will never take that hat down.		
盲		blind	If one's <i>eyes perish</i> before death, one remains <b>blind</b> for the rest of life.		8	525	486	19	モウ	めくら	Deceased eyes! Easy ;).	A person with <em>deceased</em> <em>eyes</em> is<strong> blind</strong>.	"Rather than ""dead eyes,"" break down DECEASED into TOPHAT and FISHHOOK, and picture each<strong> blind</strong> person's EYES as being unable to see because their eyes are covered with a TOP HAT, that's attached to a FISHHOOK stabbed in their eyeballs."	I keep messing up the order of the primitives here. To emphasise the position, imagine the<strong> blind</strong> person wanting to take his <em>top hat</em> off the <em>hook</em>. Before he does that, though, he needs to re-attach his <em>eye</em>balls, which are rolling around on the floor.	The<strong> blind</strong> man could not see anything with his EYES, but he claimed, when he looked up, he could see the DECEASED existing above.		
妄		delusion	"The ""ideal <i>woman</i>"" one daydreams about is no more than a <b>delusion</b>. Hence, <i>perish</i> the thought of her."		6	526	487	19	モウ、ボウ	みだ.りに	"I had a problem with remembering that ""deceased"" went over the ""woman"". So, here's my story: The<strong> delusion</strong>al woman was carrying her deceased husband on her back."	If you think you should <em>perish</em> for that <em>woman</em>, you have a major <strong>delusion</strong>.	"Remember ""The Corpse Bride""? Well, she is under the<strong> DELUSION</strong> that someday someone will marry her. Too bad that nobody wants to marry a <strong>dead</strong> <strong>woman</strong> ."	Romeo held the<strong> delusion</strong> that Juliet was a <em>deceased woman</em>.	He cared for her so much that he had<strong> delusion</strong>s that the <em>deceased</em> <em>woman</em>, who was 6 feet under, was still with him.		
荒		laid waste	The <i>flowers</i> that <i>perish</i> in the <i>flood</i> are taken here as symbols of an area that has been <b>laid waste</b>.		9	527	488	19	コウ	あら.い、あら-、あ.れる、あ.らす、-あ.らし、すさ.む	After Godzilla<strong> laid waste</strong> to the city, the survivors put some <em>flowers</em> on the bodies of the <em>deceased</em> and floated their bodies down the <em>stream</em>.	"<strong>Laying waste</strong> is just a euphamism for flushing poop down the toilet. It smells nothing like <em>flowers</em>, more like <em>deceased flowers</em>, and it's flushed down into a <em>stream</em> of sewage. Use ""waste"" to avoid <a href=""../v4/365.html"">destroy</a> (#365 滅) <a href=""../v4/400.html"">demolition</a> (#400 壊)."	Hurricane Katrina<strong> laid waste</strong> to New Orleans….as a result, a <em>stream</em> of <em>dead flowers</em> floated into the sea.	I <strong>laid</strong> my <strong>waste</strong> in the toilet, sprayed some <em>flower</em>-scented air freshener, then <em>perished</em> the <strong>waste</strong> I <strong>laid</strong> with the toilet's <em>stream</em>.	The army that<strong> laid waste</strong> the entire region left nothing but <em>flowers</em> marking where thousands <em>perish</em>ed and blood flowed in <em>streams</em>. 荒い あらい rough, rude, wild; 荒っぽい (あらっぽい) : rough, rude; 荒廃 (こうはい) : ruin; 荒らす (あらす) : to lay waste, to devastate, to damage, to invade, to break into; 荒れる (あれる) : be stormy, lose one's temper.		
望		ambition	"The story of <b>ambition</b> talks of a <i>king</i> walking under the <i>perishing</i> (or ""waning"") <i>moon</i> dreaming great dreams about his kingdom. (The roots of <b>ambition</b> are from the same word as ""ambulate,"" meaning to walk about.)"		11	528	489	19	ボウ、モウ	のぞ.む、もち	You're <em>dead meat</em>, buddy, my<strong> ambition</strong> is to be <em>king</em>.	The <strong>ambitions</strong> of <em>kings</em> often result in <em>dead</em> <em>bodies</em>.	The <em>king</em> had great<strong> ambition</strong> to have a son, but after certain <em>part of his body</em> <em>perished</em> he lost all hope.	The <em>king</em>'s one<strong> ambition</strong>, before he <em>perishes</em>, is to go to the <em>moon</em>.	He who has<strong> ambition</strong> must be prepared to walk over the <em>dead</em> <em>body</em> of the previous <em>king</em>.		
方		direction	Spinning a <i>dagger</i> about on its hilt on the top of a <i>top hat</i> - waiting to see in which <b>direction</b> it points when it comes to rest - one leaves to fate where one is going next. Take care in writing this character.	* As a primitive, this character will take the sense of a <i>compass</i>, the instrument used to determine <i>direction</i>.	4	529	490	19	ホウ	かた、-かた、-がた	"Note: The primitives are <em>top hat</em> and <em>bound up</em>. Compare <a href=""../v4/64.html"">ten thousand</a> (#64 万). Story: A rich man wearing a <em>top hat</em> and <em>bound up</em> from head to toe hobbles up to you and asks for <strong>directions</strong> to the nearest police station because he just escaped from his kidnappers."	I always keep my <strong>directions</strong> <em>bound</em> to the bottom of my <em>top hat</em> so I won't lose them.	To find the<strong> direction</strong>, the magician waved his <em>top hat</em> over his <em>dagger</em> to make it function as a makeshift magical compass.	Is that a DAGGER under your HAT, of are you just happy to see me? Give me some<strong> DIRECTION</strong> here.	I always have a <em>compass</em> <em>bound</em> underneath my <em>top hat</em>, so I know I'm always headed in the right <em>direction</em>.		
妨		disturb	Imagine a <i>compass</i> that is <b>disturbed</b> every time a <i>woman</i> passes by, sending the needle spinning madly round and round.		7	530	491	19	ボウ	さまた.げる	Capt. Jack Sparrow's compass gets<strong> disturb</strong>ed every time a beautiful woman walks by him (just picture Keira Knightley in her sexy asian outfit as Elizabeth and the image will be fixed forever).	One way to<strong> Disturb</strong> a woman is to give her directions while she is in the middle of driving – she just can't take that kind of stress.	"In college, whenever I had a <em>woman</em> in my room, I'd hang a <em>compass</em> on the doorknob as a do not <strong>disturb</strong> sign. The compass let my roomie know that he needed to ""take a hike""."	It's<strong> DISTURB</strong>ING how bad women are with directions.	If an attractive <em>woman</em> passes by, it can<strong> disturb</strong> your moral <em>compass</em>.		
坊		boy	The character for a <b>boy</b> shows us a <b>Boy</b> Scout cleaning the <i>dirt</i> out of his <i>compass</i> - the more <i>dirt</i>, the better.		7	531	492	19	ボウ、ボッ		Little<strong> boy</strong>s always head in the direction of mud and dirt.	<strong>Boy</strong>s thoughts often head in dirty directions.	It's a <em>dirty</em><strong> BOY</strong>scout, lost in the woods by himself with only his compass for <em>directions</em>. Can't you just see the lost little<strong> boy</strong>, all alone?	A<strong> Boy</strong> Scout lost in the woods, all DIRTY and holding a COMPASS, trying to find his way home. Imagine him crying because he's such a young<strong> boy</strong>, covered with DIRT streaked with tears, and banging his COMPASS against trees, etc. in an attempt to get it to work.	A<strong> boy</strong> scout will generally use the <em>ground</em> to determine <em>directions</em>.		
芳		perfumed	Here we see a special <i>compass</i> used to pick out those <i>flowers</i> most suited for making good <b>perfumes</b>.		7	532	493	19	ホウ	かんば.しい	She used a<strong> perfume</strong> so strong, that you can track her by following the <em>direction</em> of the smell of <em>flowers</em>.	People always seem to overdo it with their<strong> perfume</strong>. It seems that whenever I am at school, somebody walks by with their cheap <em>flowery</em><strong> perfume</strong>. If I close my eyes, I can actually use that <em>flower</em>iness as a compass - it tells me which direction they're in.	A <em>flowery</em> scent spreading in all <em>directions</em> is<strong> perfume</strong>.	"Bees - with their ""built-in"" compass - always pick out the best-perfumed flowers - and so does the human nose, which always turns in the direction of the best-scented flower!"	<em>Flowers</em> use their<strong> perfume</strong> to attract insects in their <em>direction</em>.		
肪		obese	If you eat too much, you may need a <i>compass</i> to find your way around the <b>obese</b> mass of <i>flesh</i> that piles up in the midsection. Compare this with your stories for <i>round</i> (Frame 44) and <i>fat</i> (Frame 494), similar in meaning but distinct in imagery.		8	533	494	19	ボウ		"""<em>Flesh</em> in all <em>directions</em>"" =<strong> obese</strong>."	Yo momma so<strong> obese</strong>, she changed the direction of the moon.	Yo momma so<strong> obese</strong>, she made the moon change direction. (I like DrWarrior12's story, but switched the words to match the kanji.).	"<strong>animal fat / +fat</strong> —– BODY PART [FLESH], DIRECTION [COMPASS] ** Hint: Animal FLESH can contain a lot of <strong>ANIMAL FAT</strong>, so you point a special ""<strong>fat</strong>-measuring COMPASS"" at it to measure how much <strong>FAT</strong> it contains. … Note: this does not mean ""obese,"" nor is it used in compound words meaning<strong> obese</strong>. It is always used together with ""shi"" in ""shibou"" for various types of ""fats."" [D2060]."	In response to DrWarrior12: Yo' mama's so<strong> obese</strong>, I needed a <em>compass</em> to navigate her round <em>flesh</em> last night. :P.		
訪		call on	When making a courtesy <b>call on</b> a dignitary, one has to gauge one's <i>words</i> with great care. Hence the need for a <i>compass</i>.		11	534	495	19	ホウ	おとず.れる、たず.ねる、と.う	When you<strong> call on</strong> someone, you point your words in their direction.	Japanese streets usually don't have names, so finding places can be difficult. So if you plan to<strong> call on</strong> someone you need two things; 1) <em>words</em> (for asking the way) and 2) a <em>compass</em> (in case you get really lost).	When <strong>calling on</strong> a girl, you'd better what what sweet <em>words</em> will turn her fancy in your <em>direction</em>. (Image: last century teenagers on a frilly couch in the sitting room, she with her back to him, and he fumbling for the right words to turn her around).	For this key word '<strong> CALL ON</strong> ' and the more useful meaning of '<strong>visit</strong>', think of: a booty call! Haven't you ever got a late night call from someone (on their <em>mobile</em>), asking for <em>words</em> of <em>direction</em> to your place? Quick, get out your Marvin Gaye record…	"Note: this kanzi means more like ""visit"" 訪ねる 【たずねる】 (v1,vt) to visit; (P). Thus, you VISIT another country that uses different WORDS than yours (language) and you have to find your way around with a COMPASS since you can't ask anyone for directions or read any signs."		
放		set free	The <i>taskmaster</i> <b>sets</b> an unruly servant <b>free</b>, giving him no more than a quick glance at the <i>compass</i> and a boot from behind.		8	535	496	19	ホウ	はな.す、-っぱな.し、はな.つ、はな.れる、こ.く、ほう.る	Go in any <em>direction</em> away from your <em>taskmaster</em> when you are <strong>set free</strong>.	"Remember what the Genie from Aladdin wanted, to ""to be free: be my own master, choose my own direction""."	The 'Saw' movies: If you follow the <em>directions</em> of the <em>taskmaster</em>, you'll be <strong>set free</strong>.	When one is<strong> set free</strong>, you no longer have to take direction from your task master.	(to help with element placement): Want to be<strong> set free</strong>? Follow me in this <em>direction</em> towards the <em>left</em>…no, not towards the <em>right</em>, your evil <em>taskmaster</em> lies this way…in the <em>direction</em> of the <em>left</em>.		
激		violent	Some cosmic <i>taskmaster</i> hovering overhead whips up the waves to make them dash <b>violently</b> against the shore. In the <i>white</i> foam that covers the <i>water</i> we see a broken <i>compass</i> floating, all that remains of a shipwreck.		16	536	497	19	ゲキ	はげ.しい	When the <em>taskmaster</em> found his favorite <em>white compas</em> damaged by <em>water</em>, he became the most<strong> violent</strong> <em>taskmaster</em> there ever was.	Overnight the slave got<strong> Violent</strong> and was Set Free. Overnight….Set Free.	In the last frame we saw the slaves set free ( 放 ); yet emancipation didn't end segregation and conflict… remember the<strong> VIOLENT</strong> clashes on the street, whereby <em>white taskmasters</em> turned fire hoses in the <em>direction</em> of the black protesters, spraying them with <em>water</em>. (Thanks to KANJI for the (true) story about Bull Connor and the protests).	"There's a theory as to why <em>Hitler</em> became so<strong> violent</strong> - basically all he lived on for weeks at a time in prison was <em>drops of water</em> - literally, just <em>drops</em> at a time, supplemented by copious amounts of <em>cocaine</em> (see <a href=""../v4/37.html"">white</a> (#37 白)) , which he snorted off the top of a <em>compass</em> blade. True story, saw it on the <em>Hitle</em>– I mean History Channel. Try this article for a jump-start. <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/0"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/0</a>,1518,354606,00.html."	Water is white in every direction, even the tasmaster is afraid of the<strong> violent</strong> sea.		
脱		undress	To <b>undress</b> is to expose the <i>flesh</i> and tempt the <i>devil</i> in the eyes of one's onlookers. Ignore the moral if you want, but not the <i>devil</i>.		11	537	498	19	ダツ	ぬ.ぐ、ぬ.げる	HORNY TEENAGERS love to<strong> UNDRESS</strong> FLESH.	Before you<strong> undress</strong> I should warn you – the sight of <em>flesh</em> brings out the <em>devil</em> in me.	If you look at pictures of <strong>undressed</strong> women, you are submitting your <em>flesh</em> to the <em>devil</em>.	If you<strong> undress</strong> the <em>flesh</em> of <em>horny teenagers,</em> you will go to jail. Unless they're over 18. Or unless you live in Alabama. Then it's alllllll good.	<strong>Undress</strong> your flesh for success, you horny little devil.		
説		explanation	Not inappropriately, this character likens an <b>explanation</b> to the <i>devil's</i> own <i>words</i>.		11	538	499	19	セツ、ゼイ	と.く	The <em>words</em> of a <em>horny teenager</em> typically fall into one of two categories: either <strong>rumors</strong> or<strong> explanation</strong>s.	The <em>words</em> of the <em>devil</em> incite <strong>rumours</strong> and false <strong>explanations</strong>.	HORNY TEENAGERS always come up with wild<strong> EXPLANATION</strong>S and THEORIES to SAY to their parents when they come home late after curfew.	I'm an atheist and I was arguing with a Catholic, trying my best to explain why I don't think God exists. It was just an<strong> explanation</strong>, but he thought my <em>words</em> were the work of the <em>devil</em>!	"When asked for an<strong> explanation</strong>, I <em>said</em>, ""The <em>devil</em> made me do it.""."		
鋭		pointed	<i>Metal</i> that has been <b>pointed</b> (as an awl, a pick, a nail, or a knife) tends to serve the <i>devil's</i> purposes as well as civilization's: our tools are also our weapons.		15	539	500	19	エイ	するど.い	<strong>Pointed</strong> is the metal devil's pitchfork.	500 kanji…Come on guys we're about 1/4 of the way there.	The <em>Horny teenager</em> who worked part time at a <em>gold</em> smelting plant always had uncontrollable errections that<strong> pointed</strong> out all the time, this is not a good thing to have when you work in a <em>gold</em> smelting plant, surely he will one day end up with a <em>Gold</em>member!	The <em>metal</em> of the <em>devil</em>, his pitchfork, is<strong> pointed</strong>.	<strong>Pointed</strong> metal objects are used by horny teens for devil's play.		
曽		formerly	"This primitive (named for its associations with the kanji of the following frame) is composed of a pair of <i>horns</i> growing out of a <i>brain</i> with a <i>tongue wagging in the mouth</i> beneath. Think of ""<b>former</b>"" in connection with administrators or heads of state who have just left office but continue to make a nuisance of themselves by advertising their opinions on public policy."	* The primitive meaning, <i>increase</i>, comes from the next frame. Always think of something multiplying wildly as you watch.	11	540	501	19	ソウ、ソ、ゾウ	かつ、かつて、すなわち	The Artist <strong>formerly</strong> Known as Prince has the <em>horniest</em> <em>brain</em> around, and I think you can imagine what his <em>wagging tongue</em> is doing…	<strong>Formerly</strong>, <em>horned</em> animals were used to plough the <em>ricefield</em>, and it took all <em>day</em>. Nowadays it's done by machine.	The horns found in the ricefields were<strong> formerly</strong> used in rituals celebrating the sun goddess, amaterasu.	I can't help but see this as the former president of the United Sates, George W. Bush. The horns growing out of his brain with an evil thought, his tongue wagging in his mouth, saying something stupid. (It helps later on. Increase = him increasing the national deficit until we have nothing but dirt left, Hate = Bush's mind). Fun stuff.	This was<strong> formerly</strong> a human, but it has turned into a demon, with only jagged <em>horns</em> sticking out of its <em>brain</em> and a disgusting <em>wagging tongue</em> at the bottom.		
増		increase	This kanji depicts an <b>increase</b> of <i>soil</i>, multiplying so fast that it literally buries everything in its path.		14	541	502	19	ゾウ	ま.す、ま.し、ふ.える、ふ.やす	Prices always<strong> INCREASE</strong> for LAND that was FORMERLY cheaper.	Farmers work the <strong>land</strong> so they can<strong> INCREASE</strong> their <strong>formerly</strong> puny crop supply.	"Lately, the artist formerly known as ""Formerly Known As Prince"", if you can believe it, has become increasingly <em>dirt</em>ier in his songs."	"This land on which ""The Artist <em>Formerly</em> Known as Prince*"" built his house has<strong> increase</strong>d in value."	Formerly there was lots of land for everyone. But as the world population<strong> increase</strong>s, your own piece of dirt is becoming more and more difficult to secure.		
贈		presents	"The <b>presents</b> offered here are <i>money</i> that <i>increases</i> each time you give it away. Do not confuse with the temporal word ""present"" (Frame 275)."		18	542	503	19	ゾウ、ソウ	おく.る	Imagine if the number of<strong> presents</strong> you get <em>increases</em> with each birthday. So on your first birthday, you receive just one <em>shell</em> as a <strong>present</strong>, but the next year it <em>increases</em> to two <em>shells</em> as<strong> presents</strong>, and so on, <em>increasing</em> and <em>increasing</em> so by the time you're elderly, the number of <em>shells</em> you'll get as<strong> presents</strong> will have <em>increased</em> to an awful lot of<strong> presents</strong>. GOT IT YET?<strong> PRESENTS</strong> = SHELLS + INCREASE.	The artist formerly known as Prince gave<strong> presents</strong> to all his fans. Picture him throwing live oysters into the audience as he performs. People are horrified and start gagging from the smell.	SEA SHELLS were FORMALLY great<strong> PRESENTS</strong>. Nowadays kids wants playstation and DS!	The money spent on<strong> presents</strong> increases every Christmas :/.	FORMERLY at Christmas I got<strong> PRESENTS</strong>, but now I just get MONEY.		
東		east	"As a ""Western"" language, English identifies the <b>east</b> with the rising <i>sun</i>. In more fanciful terms, we see the <i>sun</i> piercing through a <i>tree</i> as it rises in the <b>east</b>."	"* Both the direction <i>east</i> and the part of the world called ""the <i>East</i>"" are primitive meanings of this character."	8	543	504	19	トウ	ひがし	Traditionally seen as a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree.	Through the <em>tree</em>s, I watch the <em>sun</em> rising from the<strong> east</strong>.	To the<strong> east</strong>, you'll notice a rather large <em>tree</em> growing in the middle of that <em>ricefield</em>.	Imagine that hugely symbolic Japanese SUN piercing through a TREE as it sets on Tokyo ( 東京 ), the<strong> EAST</strong>ern capital . (with thanks to AndamanIslander, just found it easier to remember this version).	[ <strong>east</strong> = <em>tree</em> overlay <em>sun</em> ] - look <strong>east</strong> and you can see the <em>sun</em> rising through the upper branches of the <em>tree</em>s : (<em>east</em> [dir]; the <em>East</em> [region]).		
棟		ridgepole	If the piece of <i>wood</i> in the roof known as the <b>ridgepole</b> points <i>east</i>, the sunrise will be visible from the front door.		12	544	505	19	トウ	むね、むな-	Feng Shui states that the<strong> ridgepole</strong> of a house should be made of <em>wood</em> and face <em>east</em>.	Ok just a note to the 'ridgepole facing east story' im making up a story to JUSTIFY why that is the case. Assuming that 99% of you guys use the age old story of a 'sun rising through a tree tells you were the east is', back in those days when people used<strong> ridgepole</strong>s they wanted to align their houses in such a way that they face the rising sun, so they wake up with a bright day, and wake up early with the sun seeping through in a perpendicular manner( as the ridge pole faces the sun in the morning).	Way back when, all Japanese houses were made of <em>wood</em> and built with the <strong>ridgepole</strong> facing <em>east</em>. The reason for this is that since there were no alarm clocks yet, everyone needed the rising sun to wake them up every morning.	I need a <strong>ridgepole</strong> for the house I'm building. It's a very important part of the structure, so I need the best <strong>ridgepole</strong> money can buy. That means I need to special order one. The best <strong>ridgepole</strong> is made from a <em>tree</em> grown in the <em>east</em>. When the shipment arrives, I verify that the <strong>ridgepole</strong> is best quality by looking at the <em>tree</em> and seeing the <em>east</em> symbol stamped on it.	Secondo il feng shui la TRAVE PORTANTE di un edificio deve essere fatta di LEGNO e puntare ad EST.		
凍		frozen	"The whole secret to breaking the <i>ice</i> with the <i>East</i> is to peek behind those mysteriously ""<b>frozen</b> smiles."""		10	545	506	19	トウ	こお.る、こご.える、こご.る、い.てる、し.みる	<em>Eastern</em> Siberia is often<strong> frozen</strong> by <em>ice</em>. According to wikipedia, Yakutia (in Eastern Siberia) holds the record as the coldest town on Earth. Check it out yourself…it made it stick for me!	The <em>ice</em> will stay<strong> frozen</strong> until the <em>sun</em> is visible through the <em>trees</em>.	It is always the <em>east</em> side of anything, mountain, yard, forest, that stays<strong> frozen</strong> with <em>ice</em>.	ICE will stay<strong> FROZEN</strong> during the night, until the SUN rises over the EAST TREES.	Imagine your freezer ( 冷凍庫 れいとうこ) breaking down in the middle of the winter. The temperatures are just around freezing (it'll have to do). So you decide to bury all of your food in the <em>ice</em> outside to keep it fresh. As the sun rises in the <em>east</em> you must quickly move all of your perishables to the other side because of melting (of course remembering to move it back as the sun moves over the trees to the other side). It's tiresome but it'll have to do until you can fix the freezer.		
妊		pregnancy	A <i>woman</i> who is in her <b>pregnancy</b> is a bit like a <i>porter</i>, bearing her new companion wherever she goes.		7	546	507	19	ニン、ジン	はら.む、みごも.る	A pregnant woman is a porter of her child.	A <em>woman</em> becomes <strong>pregnant</strong> when <em>a drop of gentleman</em> gets inside her.	The <em>gentleman</em> gave the <em>woman</em> a <em>bit</em> of sperm…BAM<strong> PREGNANCY</strong>!	In<strong> PREGNANCY</strong>, a <em>woman</em> needs a <em>porter</em> to carry her bags to her room.	(Image: <strong>pregnant</strong> <em>woman</em> in traditional Japanese home yelling at her cowering <em>saumari</em> husband for pickles and ice cream. He dutifully obliges with great bowls of them on his head).		
廷		courts	Those who rule the <b>courts</b>, the <i>porters</i> of justice and order, are often found to <i>stretch</i> the law to suit their own purposes. Recall the kanji for <i>prolong</i> from frame 419 and keep it distinct.		7	547	508	19	テイ		A <em>porter</em> has run away from his master. His punishment is to be <em>stretched out</em> on the rack. So say the<strong> courts</strong> in this barbaric time.	The <em>gentleman</em> <em>stretched</em> the truth a <em>bit</em> in <strong>court</strong>.	Stretching the truth in court caused a drop of sweat on the gentleman's brow.	In court they STRETCHED the PORTER on the rack until he confessed. Torture!!!	[ <strong>courts</strong> = <em>stretch</em>(<em>porter</em>) ] - the <strong>courts</strong>, <em>porters</em> of justice, sometimes <em>stretch</em> the letter of the law for their own ends.		
染		dye	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>nine</i> . . . <i>tree</i>. From those elements you must compose a plot for the key word, <b>dye</b>. Here, as elsewhere, any of the alternate meanings of the primitives may be used, provided they do not require a position other than that of the kanji in question.		9	548	509	20	セン	そ.める、-ぞ.め、-ぞめ、そ.まる、し.みる、-じ.みる、し.み、-し.める	To make this<strong> dye</strong>, I used <em>water</em> and the barks of <em>nine</em> different <em>tree</em>s.	The <em>baseball</em> team hangs their freshly <strong>dye</strong>d <em>dripping</em> jerseys at the top of a <em>tree</em> to dry.	<strong>Dye</strong> is a <em>liquid</em> that has to be applied <em>nine</em> times to stain the <em>wood</em> below.	[dye; color; paint; stain; print] The most common <strong>dye</strong>s are <em>liquids</em> that come in <em>nine</em> colors (the 7 of the rainbow, plus white and black), and are extracted from <em>trees</em>.	<strong>Dye</strong> a <em>tree</em> with the <em>liquid</em> in a lengthy <em>9</em>-step process. I always remember the <em>9</em> because so far it's the number I've seen most used as a third primitive in kanji, especially with <em>tree</em>. For placement, just remember it's the <em>liquid</em> poured <em>9</em> times over the <em>tree</em>.		
燃		burn	<i>Hearth</i> . . . <i>sort of thing</i>. Beware of letting the simple reading off of the primitive elements do your work for you. Unless you make a vivid image of something <b>burning</b> and relate it just as vividly to those primitive meanings, you can count on forgetting this character very quickly.		16	549	510	20	ネン	も.える、も.やす、も.す	Any sort of thing can<strong> burn</strong> in the fire.	The Japanese are very particular about what SORT OF THINGs are considered<strong> BURN</strong>able trash and what's not.	"Somebody from PETA is really angry that they sell dog meat in China, so they've gone to<strong> burn</strong> down the whole cart (my mnemonic for ""sort of thing"" was seeing strips of dog flesh roasting, and saying ""well, that's just the <em>sort of thing</em> they do here in China)."	<em>Fire</em><strong> burn</strong>s any <em>sort of thing</em>.	"The ""hot diggety dog"" <em>sort of thing</em> caught on <em>fire</em> and exploded in the kitchen, causing me to sustain third-degree<strong> BURN</strong>S all over."		
賓		V.I.P.	The <b>V.I.P.</b> indicated here is an important guest making a visit. The elements are: <i>house</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>few</i> . . . <i>shells</i>.		15	550	511	20	ヒン		This <em>house</em> is reserved to<strong> V.I.P.</strong> only. If you are not <em>one of the few</em> with enough <em>money</em> to call you that way, keep out!	The<strong> V.I.P.</strong> visits your <em>house</em>, but your <em>ceiling</em> is too low for his inflated head, which he bumps and hurts. You have to give him your <em>few</em> <em>shells</em> as compensation.	HONEY! We've got a V.I.P visiting tonight!! Let's decorate the <em>house</em> a little why don't we? That <em>ceiling</em> is boring, let's hang a <em>few</em> fancy <em>shells</em> up there, that'll impress them!	There's only <em>one</em><strong> V.I.P.</strong> in the <em>house</em>, and all I can do is <em>focus</em> on her <em>animal legs</em>.	If you are a <strong>VIP</strong>, you are the only <em>one</em> who can enter the <em>house</em> without paying the cover charge (a <em>few</em> <em>shells</em>).		
歳		year-end	<i>Stop</i> . . . <i>march</i> . . . <i>little</i>. Be sure not to forget that final dot in the element for <i>march</i>.		13	551	512	20	サイ、セイ	とし、とせ、よわい	Santa had to put his <em>foot</em> down to stop a <em>march</em> of <em>little</em> guys, namely elves. They were protesting the harsh treatment they get every<strong> year-end</strong> when Santa asks them to step up toy production for the holiday season.	At the<strong> year-end</strong>, everything seems to come to a <em>stop</em>. However, there's still enough time for a <em>little march</em> to celebrate.	At<strong> year-end</strong>, we <em>stop</em> for a <em>small</em> celebration before <em>marching</em> ahead into the new year.	At<strong> year-end</strong>, STOP and celebrate with a LITTLE MARCH.	Every<strong> YEAR-END</strong>, its important to STOP and have ONE LITTLE PARADE to celebrate.		
県		prefecture	Above, an <i>eye</i> and a <i>fishhook</i>, and below the primitive for <i>little</i>. Although apparently the simplest of these first six kanji, when you begin to work on its plot and story you will soon find out that the number of strokes and visual complexity of a kanji does not make it easier or harder to remember. It is the primitives you have to work that are the critical factor, as in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements. Remember, you can always break larger elements down (<i>eye of a needle</i> into <i>eye</i> and <i>fishhook</i>) if you think it helps.		9	552	513	20	ケン	か.ける	In Japanese this is KEN, as in Barbie's boyfriend. He has lovely blue <em>eyes,</em> a girlfriend who is as thin as a <em>straightened out fish hook</em>. But, down where it counts, he has very <em>little</em> to show…	After sticking a <em>fishhook</em> in your <em>eye</em>, the yakuza boss probably has <em>little</em> more to do to convince you to move to a different<strong> prefecture</strong>.	<em>Smaller</em> administrative units, <em>hooked</em> together by a (Sauron's) central <em>eye</em>.	Contradictory to what Heisig says, there is no eye of a needle in this picture, because that would be the top part of 直 . Instead, there is the eye of a fishhook. I will not hazard a guess as to what lives in such a place, but in fact the eye of a fishhook - as it has well-defined borders - makes a small<strong> prefecture</strong> of its own.	<em>Eye</em> (I) live in a <em>small</em> <strong>prefecture</strong> full of <em>hook</em>ers.		
栃		horse chestnut	A tree . . . cliff . . . ten thousand.		9	553	514	20		とち	There are a bunch of<strong> HORSE CHESTNUT</strong> TREES on top of this CLIFF above the beach. Chestnuts keep rolling off the cliff and falling on people's heads. So far TEN THOUSAND people have been killed by falling chestnuts, and the Japanese government still ain't did shit about it.	There is a<strong> horse chestnut</strong> <em>tree</em> that has grown by a <em>cliff</em> for so long, it has deposited <em>10,000</em> <strong>horse chesnut</strong>s that lie at the bottom. Don't worry over this one too much, you'll spend so much time trying to figure out the right story for it, you probably won't forget it.	<strong>Horse chestnut</strong> trees grows in tens of thousands under the cliff.	Strokes 5 and 6 are in reverse order, so it's not an ordinary cliff, but a <em>drag</em> (primitive at the beginning of lesson 50!) Story: When we were kids, we loved collecting the fruits of the <strong>horse chestnut</strong> <em>tree</em>. But because there were so many to collect, we sometimes <em>dragged</em> more than <em>ten thousand</em> of them behind us!	This is NOT a cliff. the first stroke is right to left and slanted a bit. in fact, it's more like the axe blade of the axe character. story: you didn't want to try to chop down the<strong> horse chestnut</strong> tree with an axe because the chestnut kept falling on you. so instead you just stacked up <em>10,000</em> <em>axe-blades</em> next to the tree, and eventually they the stack fell on the tree and sliced it to pieces.		
地		ground	"<i>Soil</i> and a <i>scorpion</i> (an ""earth animal""). This is, of course, the full character from which the primitive for <b>ground</b> derives."		6	554	515	21	チ、ジ		Picture the<strong> ground</strong> as an extent of<em> soil</em> where<em> scorpions</em> are buried like land mines. Imagine a sign post saying 'no trespassing, <em>scorpion</em> mines' if that helps, and how it is dangerous to walk there.	The soil is littered with scorpions everywhere and no ones dares put their foot on the<strong> ground</strong>.	The DIRT SCORPION is a<strong> ground</strong>-type pokémon.	You can't escape the <em>scorpions</em> on the<strong> ground</strong> by jumping into the pond 池 - scorpions like both <em>soil</em> and water!	<strong>Ground</strong> Zero, after the bombings, only scorpions could live there.		
池		pond	"<i>Water</i> . . . <i>scorpion</i>. It would be easy to slip into a ""lazy image"" in cases like this one, picturing, let us say, a <i>scorpion</i> near the <i>water</i>. But if you picture rather a <i>scorpion</i> letting its venom out <i>drop by drop</i> until it has made a whole <b>pond</b> of the stuff, the image is more likely to remain fixed."		6	555	516	21	チ	いけ	Remember the story of the <em>scorpion</em> that begged the turtle for a ride across the<strong> pond</strong>? Halfway across the <em>water</em>, the <em>scorpion</em> stung the turtle on the neck and they both sank to the bottom.	Water scorpions loves to live in the<strong> pond</strong>.	The<strong> POND</strong> was infested with WATER SCORPIONS.	You thought water snakes were bad…this<strong> pond</strong> has WATER SCORPIONS. One sting and you're dead.	"Take out the 1st layer of <em>soil</em> in ""ground"" 地 , and add <em>water</em>. You've got a<strong> pond</strong>."		
虫		insect	Work with the pictograph as you wish.	* As a primitive, this insect will refer to the whole <i>insect</i> kingdom; it can be further specified for each kanji that contains it.	6	556	517	21	チュウ、キ	むし	I see the bottom of this kanji as an arm, and the top is an <strong>insect</strong> biting <em>into</em> the arm, sucking some blood.	<strong>Insect</strong> in one drop of amber. Think Jurassic Park.	An<strong> insect</strong> stuck its sharp, needle-like mouth <em>in</em> my arm and sucked out <em>one</em> <em>drop</em> of blood.	Just Remember it.	The top part is IN as for<strong> INSECT</strong>. the bottom part is the arm in which the<strong> insect</strong> stings. (thanks Shibo).		
蛍		lightning bug	Schoolhouse . . . insect.		11	557	518	21	ケイ	ほたる	Bugs have to go to school to learn how to become <strong>lightning bugs</strong>. Only the brightest bugs graduate to become <strong>lightning bugs</strong>.	Q: Who's the smartest <em>insect</em> in <em>school</em>? A: The<strong> lightning-bug</strong>. Because he's so bright! (Image: lightning bug in school with glasses, pocket protector, etc. Maybe even have some cool kids teasing him).	In the <em>schoolhouse</em> for <em>insects</em>, the brightest are obviously the<strong> lightning-bug</strong>s.	Think of a small Japanese <em>Schoolhouse</em> in the country. The young children have caught some<strong> lightning-bug</strong>s in a jar and placed it next to window. Long after the children go home and the sun sets, the jar continues to illuminate the room. For me, this Kanji isn't about keywords, but a strong visual.	Poor <em>schoolhouse</em>s can't afford electricity. As you can't teach in the dark the only solution is <strong>lightning-bug</strong>s! It's easy. Catch a thousand or so of them, bunch them together in a box and attach your wires to the box. Electricity flows through the wires as soon as the lightning starts flashing inside the box. Each bug has begun attacking it's neighbour with it's special weapon - the stinging rod of Lightning!		
蛇		snake	Insect . . . house . . . spoon.		11	558	519	21	ジャ、ダ、イ、ヤ	へび	A<strong> snake</strong> eats <em>insects</em> and he does that outside, while we eat in the <em>house</em> and preferably with a <em>spoon</em>.	I use a <em>spoon</em> to feed my pet-snake <em>insects</em> in the house.	"The Far Side cartoon: Picture a <strong>snake</strong> with glasses and a tie inside of his <em>house</em> in the morning. He's staring at the <em>spoon</em> next to his bowl full of <em>insects</em>. ""Dang!"" he mutters. (thanks to Cheesemaster64)."	My<strong> snake</strong> secretly eats <em>insects</em> outside the house, but in the <em>house</em>, he uses a <em>spoon</em> and follow etiquette! (adapted from nilfisq).	Solid<strong> Snake</strong> gets into his <em>insect</em> camouflage ready to infiltrate the <em>house</em> - the insect suit doesn't allow weapons to be carried so he pilfers a <em>spoon</em> and takes out the Patriots within, getting out aliv…Snake?<strong> Snake</strong>? <strong>SNAAAAAAKEEEEE</strong>!		
虹		rainbow	Insect . . . craft.		9	559	520	21	コウ	にじ	Little is it known that a<strong> rainbow</strong> is actually created by <em>insects</em> of different colours flying in formation, a <em>craft</em> they have perfected to create the<strong> rainbow</strong>s we see today.	<strong>Rainbow</strong> is of course created by billions of colored <em>insects</em> (what? you really thought it was an optical illusion?). However I had problems remembering that the <em>insect</em> primitive goes on the left. If you have similar difficulties, try this:<strong> rainbow</strong> is an <em>Insect-Craft</em>. Mnemonic: <strong>I.C.<strong> Rainbow</strong></strong> (I see<strong> rainbow</strong>).	For my arts and CRAFTs project at school, I made a<strong> rainbow</strong> out of dead BUGs spray painted different colors and glued to some paper. The teacher was not amused.	I see<strong> rainbow</strong>. I.C.<strong> rainbow</strong>. Insect Craft<strong> Rainbow</strong>.	"You know Skittles, ""Taste the<strong> RAINBOW</strong>""? The colorant that gives red Skittles their deep crimson color comes from crushing a type of <em>insect</em> called cochineal. So the next time you taste the<strong> RAINBOW</strong>, remember that you're really tasting <em>insects</em> <em>crafted</em> into sweets. (See: <a href=""http://snopes.com/food/ingredient/bugjuice.asp"">http://snopes.com/food/ingredient/bugjuice.asp</a>)."		
蝶		butterfly	Insect . . . generation . . . tree.		15	560	521	21	チョウ		A<strong> butterfly</strong> is an insect that appears after spending a generation on a tree as a cocoon.	"Tip: New primitive: Let <em>Tarzan</em> = <em>generation</em> + <em>tree</em> – because <em>Tarzan</em> lives with several <em>generation</em>s of his family at the top of a <em>tree</em>. (This combination appears five times: <a href=""../v4/228.html"">leaf</a> (#228 葉),<strong> butterfly</strong>, (FRAME 521), <a href=""../v4/2158.html"">chatter</a> (#2158 喋), <a href=""../v4/2726.html"">secret agent</a> (#2726 諜), <a href=""../v4/2926.html"">label</a> (#2926 牒)). Story: You see <em>Tarzan</em> swinging from tree to tree chasing an <em>insect</em>. Later he shows it to you neatly pinned into his<strong> butterfly</strong> collection."	Butterflies are insects that like to eat just the flowers but leave the leaves behind. (helps me to think of the kanji for leaves, minus the flower bit).	If an ugly <em>insect</em> can spend many <em>generations</em> in a <em>tree</em>, it will emerge as a beautiful<strong> butterfly</strong>.	Imagine a tree which is weighed down, so much that its bending over, perhaps, by GENERATIONS of accumulated cocoons (this also helps place generation over tree). You know which INSECT is responsible: the<strong> butterfly</strong>.		
独		single	Think of this key word in connection with bachelorhood. The elements: <i>wild dogs</i> . . . <i>insect</i>.		9	561	522	21	ドク、トク	ひと.り	The bachelor's apartment looked like it had been attacked by a <em>pack of wild dogs</em>. There were even <em>insects</em> in the kitchen. No wonder he's<strong> single</strong>!	A<strong> SINGLE</strong> guy is a WILD DOG who BUGS many women.	I'm telling you, <em>A pack of wild dogs</em> were taken down by a<strong> SINGLE</strong> <em>insect</em>!!! Shocking, I know.	Dawg, you're<strong> single</strong> cuz you got fleas in your hair!	The bachelor is<strong> single</strong> because he has a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> with <em>insects</em> (flees) instead of a nice dog.		
蚕		silkworm	<i>Heavens</i> . . . <i>insect</i>. Be sure to do something about the position of the two elements.		10	562	523	21	サン、テン	かいこ、こ	There are no <em>insects</em> in <em>heaven</em> - well, that is, except for <strong>silkworm</strong>s. What, do you expect Jesus to import his fancy robes from China?	In China it was believed that the<strong> silkworm</strong>s were <em>insects</em> sent from <em>heaven</em> because of the beautiful material they produced.	Imagine an <em>insect</em>, the<strong> silkworm</strong> descending from a <em>heavenly</em>, golden, cloud- filled sky on a single string of silk.	Heavenly bug.	The poor<strong> silkworm</strong> <em>insect</em> goes up to <em>heaven</em> after we boil its coccoon to take its silk.		
風		wind	<i>Windy</i> . . . <i>drops of</i> . . . <i>insects</i>. Hint: think of the last two primitives as representing a swarm of <i>gnats</i>, those tiny <i>drops of</i> pesky <i>insects</i>.		9	563	524	21	フウ、フ	かぜ、かざ-、-かぜ	They say that when an INSECT flaps its wings even the single DROP of<strong> WIND</strong> that it creates is sometimes enough to create a hurricane on the other side of the Earth.	The<strong> WIND</strong> usually carries things around in it - <em>drops</em> of rain or snow, and lots of <em>insects</em>.	Most people don't know that<strong> wind</strong> is actually created by a bunch of insects at the end of the earth. They wake up in the morning, twist their fitted blue baseball caps backwards (see it on top of their head?), and get to work flapping their wings as hard as they can, causing the<strong> wind</strong> shockwave to spread in all directions.	"Ever heard of the butterfly effect? All it takes is <em>one</em> flap of an insect's wings to alter the <em>wind</em> patterns around the world. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect</a>."	<em>Mediocre insects</em> get caught in the<strong> wind</strong>.		
己		self	The kanji carries the abstract sense of the <b>self</b>, the deep-down inner structure of the human person that mythology has often depicted as a <i>snake</i> - which is what the kanji shows pictographically. Be sure to keep it distinct from the similar keywords, <i>oneself</i> (frame 36) and <i>I</i> (frame 17).	* As a primitive element, this kanji can be used for the <i>snake</i> - of which it is a pictograph - or any of the various concrete symbolic meanings the <i>snake</i> has in myth and fable.	3	564	525	21	コ、キ	おのれ、つちのと、な	"This kanji looks like the ""s"" of ""self"", looking at its own reflection in a mirror (reversed sideways), as if pondering about his ""self""."	When Superman looks at him<strong>self</strong> in the mirror, this is what he sees on his chest.	"I is<strong> self</strong> educated! I drawed this ""S"" all by myself!"	I can't believe I didn't think of this as a primitive before. What word starts with the letter 's' and ends up producing someone like your 'self' later on? Sperm. Sperm are wiggly, like a snake, Contain 記 written dna records of yourself into them like words on a page, 起 rise up and run out of the penis once they ejaculate. require wrapping to prevent having babies, 包 . The task master of the sperm, 改 , make up ya own story. 紀 an era is like a thread line of different sperm that conquered the days.	<em>SSSSSSSSelf!</em>.		
起		rouse	Run . . . snake.		10	565	526	21	キ	お.きる、お.こる、お.こす、おこ.す、た.つ	Be careful when you're RUNNING through the jungle, because you might step on and<strong> ROUSE</strong> a sleeping SNAKE. Then you'll have to RUN like hell before it bites you!	Nothing will<strong> rouse</strong> you quite as much as finding a snake in your bed. You will run away like you've never run before!	"Yelling ""<em>Run!!!</em> <em>Snake!!!</em>"" is more than enough to<strong> rouse</strong> anyone nearby."	"I was having a nightmare that I was running from a snake when my mum<strong> rouse</strong>d me from my sleep. ""Wakey, wakey, run from snakey!""."	Whenever I<strong> rouse</strong> myself from bed, I find that all the blood has mysteriously <em>run</em> to my <em>snake</em>. (The same can be said for being a-roused!).		
妃		queen	Woman . . . snake.		6	566	527	21	ヒ	きさき	Cleopatra.	Be careful you don't pick up a drag<strong> queen</strong> at a club - they might look like women, but they have a snake down there!	<strong>Queen</strong> Cleopatra ends her reign (and life) with the help of a <em>snake</em>.	"Medusa, the snake<strong> queen</strong>. She's the penultimate ""snake woman""."	"A<strong> queen</strong> is a woman who only thinks about her <a href=""../v4/525.html"">self</a> (#525 己)."		
改		reformation	Pluralizing the <i>snake</i> and focusing on a single <i>taskmaster</i> may help recommend the image of Ireland's most famous <b>reformer</b>, St. Patrick, who, legend has it, drove away the <i>snakes</i> from the land.		7	567	528	21	カイ	あらた.める、あらた.まる	The <em>taskmaster</em> of Slytherin ( wizardry house symbolized by a <em>snake</em> ) plans a <strong>reformation</strong> of Hogwarts, disallowing the study of magic to all muggle-born. こわいですね！.	If you want to achieve the<strong> reformation</strong> of your <em>inner self</em> you have to control your desires and correct your flaws; in sum, be your own <em>self taskmaster</em>.	This is a Meiji<strong> reformation</strong> <em>taskmaster</em>, trying to force usage of the Roman alphabet in Japan in place of Kanji. He holds a <em>snake</em> in the shape of the letter S and tries to explain how much simpler this is (j/k).	The<strong> Reformation</strong> was led by Martin Luther, regarded as a <em>serpent</em>-in-the-grass by the Catholic Church, but as a noble <em>taskmaster</em> by his followers. 改革 かいかく reform,<strong> reformation</strong>, innovation; 改札 かいさつ ticket gate; 改める あらためる to change, alter, reform, revise.	<em>Snake</em>s are so twisted that only the most skilled <em>taskmaster</em> can achieve their<strong> reformation</strong>.		
記		scribe	Words . . . snake.		10	568	529	21	キ	しる.す	A<strong> scribe</strong> writes down the <em>words</em> spoken by a <em>snake</em> (i.e. a lawyer).	<strong>Snakes</strong> have no hands. So, when a <strong>snake</strong> needs to write down something, it has to call in a <strong>SCRIBE</strong>, who will write down all the <strong>say</strong>ings of the <strong>snake</strong>.	This<strong> scribe</strong> was truely badass - to jot down <em>words</em>, he would grab the nearest <em>snake</em> and squeeze it's venom out of it's fangs and use it as ink.. no pen for this guy.	A<strong> scribe</strong> writes down the <em>words</em> using the <em>snakes</em> venom.	The<strong> scribe</strong>s of yore had no pens or paper. To transcribe <em>words</em> they had to train<em> snakes</em> to twist their bodies into letters as they were spoken to.		
包		wrap	Bind up . . . snake.	"* The primitive meaning of <i>wrap</i> should always be used with the <i>snake</i> in mind to avoid confusion with similar terms. Just let ""<i>wrap</i>"" mean ""with a snake coiled about it."""	5	569	530	21	ホウ	つつ.む、くる.む	The <em>snake</em> <em>bound up</em> its prey by <strong>wrapping</strong> his body around it.	Imagine Jessie sending in her <em>Ekans</em> (snake pokemon), and telling it to use <em>bind</em> attack to<strong> wrap</strong> up pikachu.	<strong>Wrap</strong> it before you tap it (wrap what? your <em>snake</em>, of course…).	Picture a <em>snake</em> all <em>bound up</em> in<strong> wrap</strong>ping paper (to keep from confusing it with other kanji).	When you<strong> WRAP</strong> a Christmas gift, you BIND it UP by your - SELF.		
胞		placenta	Part of the body . . . wrap.		9	570	531	21	ホウ		Imagine a newborn baby, fresh out of the womb, being entirely <em>wrapped</em> by the long piece of <em>flesh</em>, called a <strong>placenta</strong>, that once fed him.	<strong>Placenta</strong> is <em>flesh/part of the body</em> <em>wrapped</em> around the foetus.	<strong>Placenta</strong> is the flesh that wrapped around us when we were in the womb.	"胞子 , 共産党細胞 , 細胞核 , 同胞 ,<a href=""../v4/531.html"">placenta</a> (#531 胞)ホウ( 包 ) … Parts: 月 , 包 … Note: Not<strong> Placenta</strong>; that's 胎盤 <a href=""../v4/748.html"">womb</a> (#748 胎). 胞 is any body sac, of any living thing, including cells ( 細胞 ). … Story: A <em>Part of the body</em> that completely <em>wraps</em> something up: a cell, a <strong>placenta</strong>, a spore. Include the umbilical cord as part of the<strong> placenta</strong> <em>wrapped around the fetus like a snake</em> After the Fetus is born he swings the snake around like a lasso. YeeeHa!"	The<strong> placenta</strong> is the part of the body which feeds the baby. However this unlucky baby didnt make it because the<strong> placenta</strong> wrapped around its neck and choked it to death. Not a nice story, but a memorable one. (And I know it's the umbilical cord that feeds the baby, but that doesnt affect the story).		
砲		cannon	Stones . . . wrap.		10	571	532	21	ホウ		Primitive <strong>cannons</strong> fired <em>stones</em> <em>wrapped</em> with poisonous snakes.	<strong>Cannon</strong> = <em>stone</em> projectile <em>wrapped</em> by a barrel.	A <em>stone</em> <em>wrap</em>ped in smoke blazes from the mouth of a<strong> cannon</strong>.	"Picture a very powerful<strong> cannon</strong> (such as on pirate ships), only this one's on an island, and pointed at the sea. It's recoil had to be dealt with somehow, so it is placed in a tight-fitting alcove of <em>stone</em>. Hence ""<em>stone-wrapped</em><strong> cannon</strong>""."	Rather than a<strong> cannon</strong>, think of a catapult or trebuchet. Both these siege engines fire a large <em>stone</em> that is initially <em>wrapped</em> up or cradled in some fashion. 鉄砲 (てっぽう) : gun.		
泡		bubble	Water . . . wrap.		8	572	533	21	ホウ	あわ	When <em>water</em> forms a bubble, it <em>wraps</em> a pocket of air.	To prevent people from popping bubble wrap for fun, the post office has started filling the<strong> bubbles</strong> with water.	<strong>Bubbles</strong> are just air wrapped up in a layer of water.	<strong>Bubbles</strong> are WATER WRAPPED around air.	Anyone remember the disney version of robin hood? the snake falls into the ale (water) then goes about spying on robin hood as a helicopter with a bubble wrapped around his head.		
亀		tortoise	"This is not a <i>turtle</i> (See frame 250) but a <b>tortoise</b>, however you wish to picture the difference. Let the ""<i>bound up</i>"" at the to prefer to the head, and the two <i>suns</i>, with a long tail running through it, to the shell."	* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated to its bottom half, ⻲, and comes to mean <i>eel</i>. (If it is any help, this kanji in its full form can also be remembered through its abbreviation's primitive meaning.)	11	573	534	21	キ、キュウ、キン	かめ	It seems bizarre, but<strong> tortoise</strong>s are a genetic cross with the head of a fish and the tail of an eel. Where the shell comes from, no one knows.	A<strong> tortoise</strong> is <em>prosperity</em> <em>bound up</em> with a <em>tail</em>. They are very lucky creatures.	<strong>Tortoise</strong>s are known to live relatively long lives (it is not uncommon for them to exceed 100 years of age). Thus, a<strong> tortoise</strong> is a creature that is <em>bound</em> by its shell to see <em>many days</em>, with its little tail peeking out.	<strong>Tortoise</strong>. DBZ. This is goku's symbol in his back. How can I forget it!	[addition to dwhitman's] It seems bizarre, but<strong> tortoise</strong>s are a genetic cross with the head of a fish and the tail of an eel. They are the symbol of prosperity (stroke order).		
電		electricity	Rain/weather . . . eel.		13	574	535	21	デン		Think of a two natural sources of<strong> electricity</strong>: electrical storms (a form of <em>weather</em>) and electrical <em>eel</em>s. 電話 でんわ phone, call; 電気 (でんき) :<strong> electricity</strong>, (electric) light.	This kanji was invented by the first Chinaman to discover<strong> electricity</strong>. He was so unfortunate, he stepped on an electric <em>eel</em> and got struck by <em>lighting</em> at the same time.	When it RAINS , if you put an electric EEL in the swimming pool , you can generate<strong> ELECTRICITY</strong>.	It's unwise to stand in the <em>rain</em> while holding an <em>electric</em> <strong>eel</strong>. Picture getting struck by lightning because of this.	If it <em>rains</em> on an electric <em>eel</em>, expect<strong> electricity</strong>.		
竜		dragon	<i>Vase</i> . . . <i>eel</i>. In order not to confuse this kanji with the zodiacal <i>sign of the dragon</i>, which we will meet later (Frame 2164) and use as a primitive, you might think here of a paper parade <b>dragon</b>.		10	575	536	21	リュウ、リョウ、ロウ	たつ、いせ	Have you ever seen an asian<strong> DRAGON</strong>? it looks like an eel, but can stand up because it has legs.	A<strong> dragon</strong> is like a <em>standing</em> <em>eel</em>.	If the poor villagers don't provide him with a <em>vase</em> full of <em>eels</em> each day, the<strong> dragon</strong> will lay waste to the village.	<strong>Dragon</strong>s actually evolved from <em>eels</em> a long time ago - they learned to <em>stand up</em> and became much bigger (and the ability to produce electricity evolved into fire-breathing).	Think Mushu from Mulan. Mushu was far from the most impressive<strong> dragon</strong>. He looked nothing more than a <em>eel</em> <em>standing up</em>. Mulan was very disappointed.		
滝		waterfall	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>vase</i> . . . <i>eels</i>. To avoid the confusion mentioned in the previous frame, the character learned there for <i>dragon</i> should not be used as a primitive.		13	576	537	21	ロウ、ソウ	たき	The Water Dragon dwells in the<strong> waterfall</strong>.	Ever went under a<strong> waterfall</strong>, <em>vase</em> in hand, trying to catch <em>eels</em> from the <em>water</em> as it pours down?	A<strong> WATERFALL</strong> makes the WATER roar like a DRAGON.	I imagine an incredibly high<strong> waterfall</strong> spilling into a small <em>vase</em>. Several <em>eel</em> are swimming over the edge and having a diving competition to see whether they can make it into the <em>vase</em>. Just imagine a few missing and you're set.	In Saint Seiya, the <em><strong>Dragon</strong></em> knight was always training under a<strong> Waterfall</strong>.		
豚		pork	Flesh . . . sow.		11	577	538	21	トン	ぶた	<strong>Pork</strong> comes from the flesh of a sow.	"One possible pictograph for ""<strong>sow</strong>"" primitive: the top line is a feeding trough, the stroke touching it is the head, the long curved stroke is the body (with a little hook at the end for the curly tail), and the four remaining strokes are the sow's legs."	When a mother pig nurses its piglets, we call it a SOW. When that same mother pig's <em>body parts</em> are on our plates, we call them<strong> PORK</strong>.	<strong>Pork</strong> is the name we give to the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>sow</em>.	When Kermit was caught eating barbecued <strong>PORK</strong> rinds at the bar with Fozzie, he spent an entire <em>month</em> apologizing to <em>Miss Piggy</em>.		
逐		pursue	Sows . . . road.		10	578	539	21	チク		"In association with <a href=""../v4/540.html"">consummate</a> (#540 遂), our <em>sow</em> is on the road <strong>pursuing</strong> a mate."	"The <em>pig</em> is on the <em>road</em> in the<strong> pursue</strong> of the turtle who is trying to <a href=""../v4/283.html"">escape</a> (#283 逃). (See story on <a href=""../v4/283.html"">escape</a> (#283 逃) & <a href=""../v4/540.html"">consummate</a> (#540 遂))."	In order to hunt for food one must<strong> pursue</strong> the fat sow on the road.	Miss Piggy, everybody's favorite <em>sow</em>, is hitting the <em>road</em> to<strong> pursue</strong> her long lost Kermit the frog.	Think of cops (P.I.G.s) pursuing someone down the road. (e.g. a Ron Ronnie Run clip).		
遂		consummate	The <i>horns</i> atop the <i>sow</i> suggest a boar at work in the background. Add the element for a <i>road</i>. Now create a story whose meaning is: <b>consummate</b>.		12	579	540	21	スイ	と.げる、つい.に	This is still Miss Piggy only she's gotten <em>horny</em> (as she often does) and now she's <em>pursuing</em> Kermit to help her<strong> consummate</strong> her desires.	"I don't often complain about Heisig's keywords - but 'consummate' is a little misleading. Think about this kanji in terms of <strong>ACCOMPLISH</strong> or ""realize"" rather than a sexual encounter. Or, combine the two: the policemen thought they had <strong>accomplished</strong> the task of <em>driving out</em> (see <strong>pursue</strong>, last frame) all the <em>sows</em>, but they received a phone call reporting two <em>horny</em> pigs <strong>CONSUMMATING</strong> on a <em>road</em>. When they got there, they found a male and female police officer, not pigs!"	"In association with <a href=""../v4/539.html"">pursue</a> (#539 逐), our <em>sow</em> has tracked down a suitable mate, they've<strong> consummate</strong>d their relationship, and now the <em>little sow</em> is all grown up into a <em>boar</em> with horns."	The Horny Pig<strong> Consummate</strong>s in the middle of the Road.	"The turtle promised to marry the pig, but after some second thoughts the turtle is on the road trying to <a href=""../v4/283.html"">escape</a> (#283 逃) and the pig is on the <a href=""../v4/539.html"">pursue</a> (#539 逐). We end up with a <em>horn</em>y <em>pursue</em>r trying to<strong> consummate</strong> the matrimony."		
家		house	"This is the full character whose primitive form we learned already. To help a little, this kanji recalls the times when the ""domestic"" animals were, as the word itself suggests, really kept in the <b>house</b>. Hence: <i>house</i> . . . <i>sow</i>."		10	580	541	21	カ、ケ	いえ、や、うち	"Think of ""The Three Little Pigs"". There was a <em>house</em> made of straw, another made of sticks, and a third made of bricks, each occupied by a <em>pig</em>. So, naturally, <em>housetop</em> over <em>pig</em> means<strong> house</strong>, the central element of that story."	Man, ever hear of cleaning? This<strong> house</strong> is a <em>pig</em> sty.	Miss piggy in the hooooooooooooooooouse.	ALL YOUR <em>HOUSE</em> ARE BELONG TO <em>PIG</em>.	ANIMAL FARM - The PIGS took to taking charge of the barn<strong> HOUSE</strong>.		
嫁		marry into	The kanji in this frame demonstrates the traditional Japanese approach to marriage: it is the <i>woman</i> who leaves her family for another <i>house</i>hold, thus <b>marrying into</b> a man's family.		13	581	542	21	カ	よめ、とつ.ぐ、い.く、ゆ.く	Since the Nihonjin man is hardly ever home, the <em>woman</em> feels more like she's married into the <em>house</em> than into a relationship.	Traditionally, it was the <em>women</em> who would <strong>marry into</strong> the <em>households</em> of their husband's families.	Imagine a beautiful <em>woman</em>, say Rihanna, being married inside your <em>house to a pig</em>, an actual pig. Your house is filled with her pig family dressed up like humans. 'I can't believe it, this beautiful woman is about to<strong> marry into</strong> a pig family right in my house!'.	婿嫁婚姻 : Four kanji related to marriage, all with the <em>woman</em> primitive. <strong>Bridegroom</strong>: for the honeymoon, he takes her to the <em>zoo</em> for a <em>month</em>. <strong>Marry into</strong>: since the J-husband is never home, she feels more like she's married into the <em>house</em> than into a relationship. <strong>Marriage</strong>: is when she gets a new <em>family name</em> on one particular <em>day</em>. <strong>Matrimony</strong>: is the state after the marriage, where she has the husband <em>pent in</em> like a <em>dog</em>… 嫁 [よめ].	A poor woman marrying into the house of a real pig.		
豪		overpowering	Tall . . . crowned . . . sow.		14	582	543	21	ゴウ	えら.い	In Orwell's 'Animal Farm' the pigs <strong>overpowered</strong> every other animals. They <em>crownded</em> themselves as ruler of the farm and walked <em>tall</em> on their rear legs, a crime strictly forbidden in the animal republic.	Ganon, the <em>tall crowned pig</em>, has been<strong> overpowering</strong> ther land of Hyrule for decades.	"The tall, crowned ""king-porker"" from Orwell's Animal Farm was an<strong> overpowering</strong> pig named Napoleon."	This kanji is also used for <strong>Australia</strong>. Think about it from Japan's point of view. On average Australians are taller than the Japanese. Australia is nominally a monarchy, indicated by the crown. As far as manners go, compared to the Japanese, typical ockers are pigs.	"Imagine a tall crown wearing Ms. Piggy beating the $#it out of Kermit…"		
腸		intestines	Flesh . . . piggy bank.		13	583	544	21	チョウ	はらわた	<strong>Intestines</strong> are the part of the body that is taken out of piglets to make piggy banks. Just imagine factory workers scraping out the<strong> intestines</strong> of real piglets and packaging them up for little children.	Taking things too literally, you used a real <em>piglet</em> as a <em>piggy bank</em>. Now when you smash it open to get your coins out, you have to dig out your coins from its<strong> intestines</strong>. ew.	Imagine a child's horror if upon smashing open his <em>piggy bank</em>, instead of coins, <strong>instestines</strong>(<em>flesh</em>) pours out.	The<strong> intestines</strong> are like the <em>piggy bank</em> of your <em>flesh</em>, everyday you deposit a little more into them…	The<strong> INTESTINES</strong> are the part of our BODY that acts like our PIGGY BANKS. We store our food in it!		
場		location	Soil . . . piggy bank.		12	584	545	21	ジョウ、チョウ	ば	You're looking for a good<strong> location</strong> to bury your <em>piggy bank</em> savings. It has to be in some soft <em>soil</em> that's easy to dig up, well hidden, and easy to rememger like this kanji.	"Don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/1127.html"">place</a> (#1127 所). Think of<strong> location</strong> not as a single fixed spot, but as the act of locating. You've buried your <em>piggy bank</em> in the <em>dirt</em> in your backyard, but you can't remember where. You frantically dig everywhere in a process of<strong> location</strong> to find your piggy bank."	<strong>Location</strong>,<strong> location</strong>,<strong> location</strong>, they say in the real estate business, cuz they know if you find the right bit of <em>soil,</em> you can pretty much take that to the <em>(piggy) bank</em>.	A pile of <strong>soil</strong> marks the<strong> location</strong> of where I burried my <strong>piggy-bank</strong>.	A pirate finally finds the<strong> location</strong> of a legendary buried treasure, where X marked the spot. But after long hours of digging, he discovers it was just some kid's piggy bank. ARRRRR!!!!		
湯		hot water	Water . . . piggy bank.		12	585	546	21	トウ	ゆ	Imagine a<strong> hot water</strong> kettle for your tea, except this one is a pink piggy bank that pours the water from its snout (and squeals when the water is piping hot). Make sure to use a potholder!	"<strong>Hot water</strong> is a phrase that can mean ""getting into trouble."" This kanji pictures just one of the many meanings of that phrase: it's <em>water</em> that you get into (with creditors and the like) when your <em>piggy bank</em> is empty!"	My<strong> HOT WATER</strong> cut off because I forgot to pay the bill. So I break open my <em>piggy bank</em> and run to the local 銭湯 (sentou; public bath).	<strong>Hot water</strong> is the kind of <em>water</em> you don't have when your <em>piggy bank</em> is empty.	If you put your <em>piggy bank</em> in <strong>hot <em>water</em></strong> you will make sure no one can get to it… … including yourself.		
羊		sheep	This pictograph shows the animal <i>horns</i> at the top attached to the head (3rd stroke), the front and back legs (strokes 4 and 5) and body (final stroke).	"* The primitive meaning of <i>sheep</i> can add the further connotations given in the following frame. As we saw with the <i>cow</i>, the ""tail"" is cut off when it is set immediately over another element: ⺷. Note the change in stroke order, as exemplified in the following frame."	6	586	547	21	ヨウ	ひつじ	Picture of a<strong> sheep</strong> run over by a steam roller. Must have been a ram, note the horns.	Our <strong>Lord and King</strong> put on <strong>ears</strong> and a <strong>tail</strong> to become a lowly<strong> sheep</strong> for the slaughter.	The horny king of the<strong> SHEEP</strong> had a huge erection.	"(you might consider using something with a religious connotation when used as a primitive, like ""lamb of god"" or something, because<strong> sheep</strong> seems to appear in a lot of religious kanji)."	DO NOT CONFUSE these<strong> SHEEP</strong>S with the SHIPS in the OCEAN ( frame 549). The only difference is the water. 羊 洋 .		
美		beauty	Try to think of what the Chinese were on to when they associated the idea of <b>beauty</b> with a <i>large sheep</i>.		9	587	548	21	ビ、ミ	うつく.しい	I guess this kanji proves it's not just the Welsh whose idea of<strong> beauty</strong> is a <em>large</em> <em>sheep</em>.	A <em>Sheep</em> on top of a <em>dog</em> is NOT a <strong>beautiful</strong> thing.	Who is more beautiful, a <em>sheep</em> or a <em>st. Bernhard dog</em>? Imagine a big contest with many judges, then let the sheep win, since it is on top in the kanji (perhaps even let the <em>sheep</em> ride on the <em>st. Bernhard dog</em> because it won).	Sheep dogs are <strong>beautiful</strong> animals.	(Image: a bunch of <em>big sheep</em> in a<strong> beauty</strong> pageant, bikinis and evening dresses and all).		
洋		ocean	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>sheep</i>. Be sure to keep the stories and key word of this kanji distinct from those for <i>sea</i>. (Frame 500).		9	588	549	21	ヨウ		This kanji refers to the <em>water</em>s of the Pa<em>sheep</em>hic<strong> ocean</strong>.	Remember the story of Jason and the Argonauts from Greek myth? Jason travelled across <em>oceans</em> of <em>water</em> in order to recover the fleece of a certain <em>sheep</em>.	If you drop a <em>sheep</em> into an<strong> ocean</strong>, it will soak up all the <em>water</em> with its thick coat of wool.	When you look at the<strong> ocean</strong>, those little whitecaps look like <em>sheep</em> in the <em>water</em>.	<em>Sheep</em> are pretty absorbent. If you had a few billion <em>sheep</em> handy, you could drop them all into the<strong> ocean</strong> and soak up all of the <em>water</em>, thereby creating a big white fluffy <em>sheep</em><strong> ocean</strong>.

The next time you can't sleep, instead of counting <em>sheep</em>, think of <em>word</em>y <em>sheep</em>, boring you with <strong>details</strong> of their mundane lives (baa, baa, baa, ………zzzzz). 詳しい (くわしい): knowledgeable,<strong> detailed</strong> 詳細 (しょうさい): details, particulars.	<strong>Detailed</strong> <em>words</em> must not be said <em>sheepishly</em>.

To remember which foods, take the first letter of<strong> fresh</strong>, ""F"", to stand for fish and the final sound of<strong> fresh</strong>, ""SH"", to stand for sheep:<strong> FreSH</strong>. It even puts the primitives in the right order."	"There was a fisherman living near the coast, who was also raising <em>sheep</em>.

羨		envious	<i>Sheep</i> . . . <i>water</i> . . . <i>yawn/lack</i>. Although this character looks rather simple, special care should be taken in learning it because of the proximity of the final two elements to the character for <i>next</i>, which we learned in frame 510. Note, too, that the <i>water</i> comes UNDER the <i>sheep</i>, rather than on its own to the left.		13	592	553	21	セン、エン	うらや.む、あまり	A very thirsty sheep, who always <em>lacked</em> <em>water</em>, spends his days watching his fellow <em>sheep</em> (in the farm next door or in another pen) and being very<strong> envious</strong> of their <em>water</em>.	<strong>Envious</strong> of the greener grass on the other side of the fence, the <strong>sheep</strong> looks down in disgust at his own dry grass <strong>lacking water</strong>.	Some ppl have to try things like counting SHEEP or DRINKING a glass of water before they can sleep. Some other can just YAWN and fall asleep… you can be<strong> ENVIOUS</strong> of those one.	A <em>sheep</em> that <em>lacks </em> <em>water</em> is<strong> envious</strong> of those who have it.	Unlike cotton, wool is warm even when wet, because it wicks water away from the skin. Many animals have cool adaptations and abilities that I wish I had, but I am most<strong> envious</strong> of <em>sheep</em>, because even if they get wet on the outside, the <em>water</em> is <em>lacking</em> UNDERNEATH. (helps to remember the water-lack part goes on the bottom).		
差		distinction	Wool . . . craft.		10	593	554	21	サ	さ.す、さ.し	This New-Zealand pro-gamer has won many <strong>distinctions</strong> playing <em>WoolCraft</em> (a massively multi-user game in which the goal is to shear sheep).	The<strong> distinction</strong> between fine and common wool, is the <em>craft</em>smanship of the <em>wool</em>.	Noob players make no<strong> distinction</strong> between what games they play, whether it's the geniune thing or a bootleg fake copy. The biggest example of course, would be the legit World of Warcraft and the biggest ripoff there is: World of <em>Wool</em>-<em>craft</em>!	Since all sheep look alike, it is hard to make a<strong> distinction</strong> between them. You have to learn the <em>craft</em> of telling them apart by their <em>wool</em>.

堆		piled high	Soil . . . turkey.		11	596	2185	21	タイ、ツイ	うずたか.い	After our pre-Thanksgiving massacre, we<strong> piled high</strong> all the <em>turkey</em> corpses atop the <em>soil</em> of the farmyard.	During the <em>Turkey</em> Holocaust (this is what the animal kingdom calls Thanksgiving - they have really short memories and thus don't recall that it actually happens every single year), <em>turkeys</em> are killed en masse, and their bodies are<strong> piled high</strong>. To keep them from tumbling down, a pile of <em>dirt</em> is<strong> piled high</strong> right next to them to keep them standing upright so that they will be fresh when it is time to eat them.	The farmer awakes Thanksgiving morning to find huge mounds of dirt<strong> piled high</strong> in front all of his doors and windows. He can't get out. Clever turkeys.	<em>Soil</em><strong> piled high</strong> on top of a <em>turkey</em> with only it's gobbler sticking out.	The turkey is making a pile of soil (piled high) trying to hide its doo doo.		
椎		sweet oak	Tree . . . turkey.		12	597	2505	21	ツイ、スイ	つち、う.つ	This is the kanji for the shii <em>tree</em>, on which shiitake ( 椎茸 ) mushrooms grow. It's easy to picture a <em>turkey</em> dropping by the shii <em>tree</em> to gobble down some of those <strong>sweet oaky</strong> (shiitake) mushrooms.	Why is the<strong> sweet oak</strong> so sweet? Not sure, but to me it tastes just like <em>turkey</em> (with gravy and cranberry sauce!) Now that is sweet.	I always use<strong> SWEET OAK</strong> WOOD to add flavor to roasted TURKEY.	"無脊椎動物 , 脊椎動物 , 脊椎 , 椎骨 , 椎骨 , 椎茸 , <a href=""../v4/2505.html"">sweet oak</a> (#2505 椎) ツイ,しい … Tree now written ツイ. Used for <strong>Spine</strong>脊椎, and Shiitake 椎茸 . Replacing the key word to <strong>Spine</strong> ( お風呂 <a href=""../v4/24.html"">spine</a> (#24 呂) is a phonetic only character), remember the 仙台 hermits we 催す <a href=""../v4/987.html"">sponsor</a> (#987 催) 'd? Well we got them out of the <em>mountains</em> and then we got the <em>Mountains</em> out of them by telling them to get a <strong>Spine</strong> and got a job.

焦		char	Turkey . . . oven fire.		12	599	557	21	ショウ	こ.げる、こ.がす、こ.がれる、あせ.る	When I put the <em>turkey</em> over the <em>oven fire</em>, it always ends up being <strong>charred</strong> beyond recognition. I'm not a very good cook.	<strong>Char</strong> could be any meat over <em>oven fire</em>. So why is it a <em>turkey</em> in this kanji? Because<strong> char</strong>red <em>turkey</em> is what sticks out most in your mind as the thing that ruined Thanksgiving dinner.	We see here the <em>roadrunner</em>, running so fast that it <strong>chars</strong> the ground beneath it, leaving a trace of <em>fire</em>.	Turkey is not very common in Japan. (found only in Subway sandwiches!) So when Japanese try to barbecue turkey on the grill, they always<strong> char</strong> the meat. <em>masaka!</em>.	Unfortunately, Ash Ketchum's<strong> char</strong>mander sucked so bad it devolved into a<strong> char</strong>turkey.<strong> Char</strong>mander has flames on its tail,<strong> char</strong>turkey has flames on its butt.

You may be familiar with this unfortunate natural phenomenon. The Coral <strong>Reef</strong>s are some of the most beautiful habitats in the world, full of color and life. However, recently due to overfishing, the <strong>reef</strong>s have been undergoing something called Coral Bleaching. The algae dies off, and the sun <em>chars</em> the coral, leaving nothing but a barren wasteland that looks like <em>charred rock</em>. The color is gone and all you have left is bone-dry, white <em>rocky charred</em> stuff.	A turkey gets stoned on<strong> reef</strong>ers to prepare itself for the oblivion of the oven.	This character illustrates ancient ideas about the origin of coral <strong>reefs</strong>. Although we now know that coral are in fact marine organisms, the ancients thought that <strong>reefs</strong> looked like a gigantic pile of <em>stones</em> that had been <em>charred</em>.

午		noon	With a bit of stretching, you might see a horse's head pointing leftwards in this character. That gives the primary meaning of the Chinese zodiacal sign of the horse, which corresponds to the hour of <b>noon</b>. Note how this kanji primitive differs from that for <i>cow</i> (Frame 260).	* As a primitive, this character gets the meaning of a <i>horse</i>.

権		authority	Tree . . . Pegasus.		15	613	571	21	ケン、ゴン	おもり、かり、はか.る	I have Eric Cartman of the “South Park” animated series, wearing a cop uniform, riding a wooden Pegasus (such as on a funfair), and yelling “RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH!!!”.	No one has the<strong> authority</strong> to tie up a <em>pegasus</em> to a <em>tree</em>!	The park authorities are here, making sure everyone's dog is on a leash and everyone's pegasus is tied to a tree.	"""Respect my<strong> AUTHORITY</strong>,"" said Cartman as he whacked PEGASUS with his TREE."	<strong>Pegasus</strong> has<strong> authority</strong> over the <strong>tree</strong>s, because she can fly.		
観		outlook	Pegasus . . . see.		18	614	572	21	カン	み.る、しめ.す	Microsoft<strong> Outlook</strong> works about as well as a pegasus that can't see: they both crash all the time.	I used to hate birds.They're loud, stupid and worst of all they shit on your head. Used to think birds were the most vile creatures on earth. Then I encountered a <em>pegasus</em>. I was just walking down the road, minding my own business when I happened to <em>look</em> up. I <em>saw</em> it there, braying noisily, ivory wings outstretched like an angel, back leg raised ever so slightly. It dropped a steaming brown load right on my face. It changed my<strong> outlook</strong> completely. Birds are the second most vile creatures on earth.	This kanji actually means <strong>view</strong>. While on a pegasus you will see a great <strong>view</strong>.	You see a Pegasus flying far above, and wonder what your<strong> outlook</strong> on life would be if you could see what the Pegasus sees.	You can see an amazing<strong> outlook</strong> when riding a pegasus.		
羽		feathers	From the pictograph of two bird-wings, we get <b>feathers</b>.	* The related image of <i>wings</i> can be added as a primitive meaning. It can also take the form <sup>ョョ</sup> when used as a primitive, as we shall see in frames 618 and 619.	6	615	573	21	ウ	は、わ、はね	Pictograph. Easy enough.	These days the biggest concern in airline safety is ICE on the WINGS of the plane. Birds that fly long distances also have to worry about getting ICE on their<strong> FEATHERS</strong>.	Two wings full of<strong> feathers</strong>.	"Just noting how I use this as a primitive. When it's in this full form, containing the ""ice"" element, I try to think of it as <em>penguins</em> or flightless wings. When it's the variant with straight lines, then it's <em>feathers</em> or flying wings."	This is a picture of two exact<strong> feathers</strong> of the ice bird.

"Little birds with <em>white feathers</em> still have a lot to<strong> learn</strong>. When their plumage will be mature enough they'll be ready to fly away. To help not confusing it with <a href=""../v4/324.html"">study</a> (#324 学), think birds don't need to study in order to<strong> learn</strong>."

曰		sayeth	<i>Pent in</i> . . . <i>one</i>. The key word refers to famous sayings of famous people, and is the origin for the primitive meaning of <i>a tongue wagging in the mouth</i> that we learned in frame 12.

You are pent in the garden of eden with one tree, but outside is the whole world to explore! What a<strong> quandary</strong> – should you stay in paradise with the tree of knowledge or should you go out into the world?	To solve a<strong> quandary</strong>, you have to think outside the <em>box.</em> For example, how do I get this huge Christmas <em>tree</em> into through the door?

An old<strong> harden</strong>ed criminal who is dying pent up in a prison cell.	If you're <em>old</em> and in a <em>box</em> then you've probably<strong> harden</strong>ed from rigor mortis.

錮		weld	Metal . . . harden.		16	623	3013	22	コ	ふさ.ぐ	RTK supplement: <strong>weld</strong> (metal, harden) -<strong> weld</strong>ing the metal bars of a cage together, to <em>harden</em> the cage even more… nothing shall escape now!	You<strong> weld</strong> <em>metal</em> in the knowledge that it will <em>harden</em> again.	<strong>imprison</strong>: <em>Metal hardening</em> describes the method of <strong>imprisoning</strong> people in Star Wars by freezing them in carbonite. (The carbonite as used in Star Wars is a fictional substance and may or may not be metal, but I'll imagine it is.).	The <strong>imprisoned</strong> criminal grew <em>hardened</em> due to the many years he spent behind the <em>metal</em> bars in the prison.	By<strong> weld</strong>ing <em>metal</em> and then subjecting it to refrigeration, it will become very <em>hard</em> by the process known as annealing.		
国		country	Jewels . . . pent in.		8	624	581	22	コク	くに	In my<strong> country</strong> (England) the crown <em>jewels</em> are kept <em>pent-in</em> in the Tower of London. Which happens to be where enemies of the state were once also <em>pent-in</em> (probably for trying to steal those <em>jewels</em>).	Just think of Japan, a<strong> country</strong> which is like a jewel but historically very enclosed.	Think of a<strong> country</strong> that has “<em>pent in</em>” all of its <em>jewels</em> so they wouldn't go away. Maybe it was China and its great wall.	Japan was once a<strong> COUNTRY</strong> that went through a period of isolationism; it's JEWELS were PENT-IN and could not be traded.	Picture a map of the world showing all the different <strong>countries</strong> PENT IN with thick borders, each one with an image of a pile of JEWELS proportional to its wealth (like those cute little geography maps from elementary school).

You must stick to the<strong> group</strong> like <em>glue</em>, and you will be <em>pent-in</em> for life, never being able to leave.	"A <em>pent-in</em><strong> group</strong> will naturally be more cohesive, or ""<em>glued</em> together.""."	Living in Japan, this image is too true for comfort. Every<strong> group</strong> I've ever encoutered sticks together like <em>glue</em>, but it seems thats not enough so they create little barriers to keep outsiders out and insiders in, once someone finds their<strong> group</strong> they are pretty much <em>pent in</em> for life. (that felt good).	For the Haruhism people: SOS-dan!	Picture a bunch of<strong> group</strong>ies on a tour bus with some big rock band. The band members are getting tired of these<strong> group</strong>ies, so the band leaves the tour bus, superglues the door and the windows shut, and leave them all pent up in the bus.		
因		cause	St. Bernard dog . . . pent in.		6	626	583	22	イン	よ.る、ちな.む	We once had a <em>dog</em> with big paws // and oh what great trouble he'd<strong> cause</strong> // we built a huge pen // to keep him <em>pent in</em> // and stop him from breaking more laws //.	Why is there poop on the kitchen floor? Oh, the<strong> cause</strong> is that you kept the <em>dog</em> <em>pent in</em> the house all day. Next time remember to walk him.	The<strong> cause</strong> of the big bang (the ultimate<strong> cause</strong>) was a very <em>large</em> amount of matter <em>pent in</em> to a point in space.	<strong>Cause</strong> is a difficult key word, hard to associate with a concrete image. So let 'cause' be associated with 'first<strong> cause</strong>'. Let this be the big bang (not worry about what<strong> cause</strong>d <em>that</em>, since people can't decide what it is so it's no use for an image). The first<strong> cause</strong>, the big bang, is represented by having something <em>large</em> (the universe) <em>pent in</em> inside a tiny space. It's about to explode and<strong> cause</strong> EVERYTHING.	Our<strong> cause</strong> is to rescue the pent in St. Bernard.		
姻		matrimony	"<i>Woman</i> . . . <i>cause</i>.

Forget the heisig stuff for this one. To me it looks like a fat girl looking in a mirror and her reflection is skinny, this is how every fat girl should feel on her day of<strong> matrimony</strong>.	When the <em>woman</em> gets angry, she treats her man like a <em>pent in dog</em> (i.e., puts him in the doghouse). It's a perfect metaphor for the state of<strong> matrimony</strong>.	<strong>Matrimony</strong> is a <em>cause</em> of <em>women's</em> suffering.	婿嫁婚姻 : Four kanji related to marriage, all with the <em>woman</em> primitive. <strong>Bridegroom</strong>: for the honeymoon, he takes her to the <em>zoo</em> for a <em>month</em>. <strong>Marry into</strong>: since the J-husband is never home, she feels more like she's married into the <em>house</em> than into a relationship. <strong>Marriage</strong>: is when she gets a new <em>family name</em> on one particular <em>day</em>. <strong>Matrimony</strong>: is the state after the marriage, where she has the husband <em>pent in</em> like a <em>big</em> St. Bernard.

Imagine a group of <strong>windpipes</strong> chatting: “That <em>mouth</em> is the <em>cause</em> of all my problems, you know, always breathing in germs, etc.”.	The<strong> windpipe</strong> in your <em>mouth</em> is what <em>causes</em> you to breath.	"Let's break this kanji down further into a <em>mouth</em> and a <em>mouth with a dog in it</em>.

The TV on the wall has some educational content running: ""Here's a picture of a healthy<strong> windpipe</strong>,"" the T-Rex doctor says while pointing to an X-ray of a clear<strong> windpipe</strong>, which looks just like a <em>mouth</em>. ""And here's an X-ray of a <em>windpipe with a dog stuck</em> in it. Don't let this happen to you!""."	The sounds which come out of your mouth, are caused by your<strong> windpipe</strong>.		
園		park	Pent in . . . lidded crock . . . scarf.		13	629	585	22	エン	その	A nice picnic <em>pent up</em> in the<strong> park</strong>, with your <em>crock pot</em> and <em>scarf</em> (picnic blanket).	You're walking in the<strong> park</strong> and a little ways off the path there is a “pent in” lidded crock on a scarf. Just picture it and it should work. You may also imagine the lidded crock family is having a picnic in the<strong> park</strong>, and 'baby lidded crock' was left alone in its pen/playpen, wearing a scarf (or sleeping on a scarf).	"In the<strong> park</strong>, I discovered a <em>lidded crock wrapped with a scarf</em>. The police promptly <em>pent</em> it up.

"This is just like the <em>lidded crock</em> wrapped in a <em>scarf</em> you had to stay <a href=""../v4/402.html"">distant</a> (#402 遠) from.

When wearing a nice <em>long kimono</em>, the best thing to do is to go visit the<strong> park</strong> (which is obviously hedged in), and show off your stuff.		
回		-times	"The suffix ""<b>-times</b>"" refers to a number of repetitions. Its elements: <i>a mouth</i> . . . <i>pent in</i>.

Abraham Lincoln used a simple mound of <em>soil</em> for a<strong> podium</strong>, when he wore his <em>top hat</em> and gave the speech he had practiced many <em>times</em> until <em>nightbreak</em>. But it was so magnificent that no one noticed.	"A<strong> podium</strong> is a bit of raised <em>ground</em> where <em>top-hatted</em> ""important people"" go <em>around and around</em> making speeches until <em>nightbreak</em>."	Think of the movie <em>Ground</em> hogs day. The mayor in his <em>top hat</em> takes the<strong> podium</strong> and tries many <em>times</em> to get the ground hog to come out before <em>night break.</em>.	It's the oldest trick in the books.

It's a big cave that Batman uses as a<strong> warehouse</strong> to store his car, the Batmobile, and all his cool big-boy toys.	Have you ever worked in a<strong> warehouse</strong>? It's like a giant metal <em>cave</em>. Watch out for that <em>forklift</em>!	With rents high and auto businesses failing, GM chose to use a <em>cave</em> as a<strong> warehouse</strong> for their unsold <em>cars</em>.	I have a secret<strong> warehouse</strong>, set in a cliff cave, with a beautiful view of a turquoise ocean.

庭		courtyard	Cave . . . courts.		10	634	590	22	テイ	にわ	When the courthouse caved in, trials had to be held in the<strong> courtyard</strong>.	Back in caveman days, <em>courts</em> were held in <em>caves</em>. When too many people showed up to watch, they spilled out into the<strong> courtyard</strong> (the yard outside the <em>cave</em> <em>court </em>) . 庭 (にわ): garden, yard, compound 庭園 (ていえん): garden, park 校庭 (こうてい): schoolyard.	"A<strong> courtyard</strong> (as the name suggests) is a yard where <em>court</em> is held. However, due to frequent inclement weather, the <em>courts</em> were moved to a <em>cave</em>. Old habits die hard, however, and the name ""<em>court cave</em>"" never caught on; people still refer to it as a<strong> courtyard</strong>."	[Thanks to dingomick] The poor porter samurai, being stretched on the rack by order of the court, is being tortured in an ornate ceremonial<strong> courtyard</strong> featuring a large echoing cave, so that his screams are amplified as a warning to potential wrongdoers.

"In some of the scarier countries, when someone is invited to visit a ""government office"", it's actually a dungeon where they're dragged into a cave and nailed to the wall."	Because of his <strong>cave</strong>man instincts, Clinton tried to <strong>nail</strong> Monica L. in his <em>gov't office</em>.	The<strong> government office</strong> is on cave street.

Where is the best place to hid your <em>grove</em> of<strong> hemp</strong> trees? In a cave, you <em>dope</em>!	The world's most prolific drug dealer maintains a massive <em>grove</em> of<strong> hemp</strong> in a <em>cave</em> to avoid law enforcement.	<strong>Hemp</strong> is an extremely useful material and can be used to make produce healthy oils (such as omega-3 and 6), fibers for clothing, biomass for fuel and even sturdy industrial matierals. (All of this is true.) Unfortunately, because the USDEA is run by a bunch of morons that refuse to distinguish between it and marijuana, you can't get a permit to grow it and thus have to grow your<strong> hemp</strong> groves in a cave to avoid fines and prosecution.	The<strong> hemp</strong> grove is in the cave.

心		heart	This character, a pictographic representation of the <b>heart</b>, is among the most widely used primitives we shall meet.	* As a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings. In its kanji-form, it appears BENEATH or to the RIGHT of its relative primitive and means th physical organ of the <i>heart</i>.<br> To the LEFT, it is abbreviated to three strokes, ⺖,  and means a wildly emotional <i>state of mind</i>. And finally, at the very BOTTOM, it can take the form ⺗, in which case we give it the meaning of a <i>valentine</i>.	4	639	595	22	シン	こころ、-ごころ、りっしんべん	(mature content: violence) I hung the<strong> heart</strong> of my victim with a <em>hook</em> and three <em>drops</em> of blood spattered me.	<strong>Heart</strong> needs three drops of blood to work.	Pictograph, see book.	こころ！.	When this primitive is on the left as <em>state of mind</em>, I had a hard time visualizing it. Thus I have created the following story. All the smartest people in the country were fed up with their state governments. These great <em>minds</em> joined together and created their own official <em>state</em>: the <em>state of Mind</em>. I visualize it as a small, sectioned off area with brains floating around. A scientific utopia.		
忘		forget	Perish . . . heart.		7	640	596	22	ボウ	わす.れる	You only truly<strong> forget</strong> her when she has <em>perish</em>ed in your <em>heart</em>.	To<strong> forget</strong> means that something perishes from your heart.	<em>Perish</em> my <em>heart</em> if I<strong> forget</strong> this kanji.	A <em>dead heart</em> is the only way to <strong>forget</strong> your love.	We keep the deceased in our hearts so as not to<strong> forget</strong>.

忍		endure	Blade . . . heart. <b>Endure</b> here means long-suffering patience.		7	642	597	22	ニン	しの.ぶ、しの.ばせる	A ninja must be able to<strong> endure</strong> the pain of clinging to a ceiling, motionless, for hours at a time, waiting for just the right moment to drop down and thrust the <em>blade</em> of his sword into the <em>hearts</em> of his enemies. By the way, this character is used in the compound 忍者 (<em>ninja</em>) which is why I choose to use <em>ninja</em> as its primitive meaning.	忍び （しのび）Shinobi the 忍者 （にんじゃ）Ninja was able to <strong>endure</strong> the massacre of his family & horrors of his training by placing the way of the <em>blade</em> above the way of the <em>heart</em>.	To<strong> endure</strong> unrequited love is like living with a <em>blade</em> in your <em>heart</em>.	Someone with a <em>razor blade</em> stuck in their <em>heart</em> has to<strong> endure</strong> the pain wherever they go and can tell no one about it.	I doubt you can<strong> endure</strong> a blade in your heart for very long.

"I never read the ""acknowledgements"" section of books or theses, because they are mostly just boring <em>words</em> that i must <em>endure</em> reading, before i can get to the interesting part. :)."	"You would think that most <em>ninjas</em> (see previous frame) would<strong> acknowledge</strong> each other's presence with something like a silent nod. Imagine the consequences if, while raiding an enemy castle, one stupid <em>ninja</em> chose to<strong> acknowledge</strong> another by <em>saying</em>, ""HELLO!!""."	In Japan, people who make efforts to <em>endure</em> (gaman) can expect to receive <em>words</em> of<strong> acknowledge</strong>ment at some point. The ability to <em>endure</em> is so valued and respected in Japan that <strong>acknowlegement</strong> of some sort is virtually inevitable.	Some Oscar winners go on far too long with their acceptance speech. But we are expected to politely ENDURE their endless stream of WORDS as they<strong> acknowledge</strong> their colleagues and loved ones.		
忌		mourning	Snake . . . heart.		7	644	599	22	キ	い.む、い.み、い.まわしい	Remember the tale of Cleopatra? She was<strong> MOURNING</strong> the loss of her Marc Antony, so she placed the asp SNAKE to her HEART.	"You are<strong> mourning</strong> the death of a relative, and it feels as if a snake had bitten into your heart. – ""mourning feels like <em>snake</em>-bitten <em>heart</em>""."	<strong>Mourning</strong> is really self-pity. When someone mourns, it seems on the surface that they are feeling sadness for a lost loved one. In reality, they are feeling heavy-hearted because they themselves have permanently lost something very precious.	<strong>Mourning</strong> can feel like a constrictor SNAKE is squeezing your HEART to death.	When <em>Snake</em> finally killed Sniper Wolf, his <em>heart</em> was filled with<strong> mourning</strong>.		
志		intention	Samurai . . . heart.		7	645	600	22	シ、シリング	こころざ.す、こころざし	A <em>samurai'</em>s <strong>intentions</strong> always come from the <em>heart</em>.	<em>Gentleman</em> always have <em>hearts</em> full of good<strong> intention</strong>s.	<em>Tom Cruise</em> no doubt had good<strong> intention</strong>s when he made the Last <em>Samurai</em> - his heart in the right place (right there, down to earth). Too bad the concept of a white dude as the last samurai is ridiculous, if not offensive. Picture Tom Cruise in a press conference being asked about this, at which point he jumps on a heart-shaped, grabs somebody's hands, and screams BUT MY<strong> INTENTION</strong>S WERE FROM THE HEART! SCIENTOLOGY HELPS PEOPLE.	"A samurai shows up at the door to pick up his date. Her father asks, ""What are your<strong> intention</strong>s with my daughter?"" He responds that his<strong> intention</strong>s come from the heart."	"Father: ""What are your<strong> intention</strong>s to my daughter?"". <em>Samurai</em>: ""I intend to give her my <em>heart</em>! (slices out his own heart and hands it over)."		
誌		document	Words . . . intention.		14	646	601	22	シ		This is quite simple: a<strong> document</strong> is a set of <em>words</em> describing your <em>intentions</em>.	A will is an important<strong> document</strong> that contains your final <em>word</em> on how you <em>intend</em> to distribute your assets.	"A policeman stops you (in Japan) saying, ""<strong>Document</strong>s, please"". You: ""Er, I <em>intended</em> to bring them, but . . ."". Policeman: ""<em>Words</em> of <em>intention</em> are not good enough, I need to see your<strong> document</strong>s!""."	When you<strong> document</strong> your source code, you use English <em>words</em> to describe the <em>intention</em> of the highly technical program code.	<em>Words</em> can<strong> document</strong> your <em>intentions</em>.		
芯		wick	Flowers . . . heart.		7	647	2368	22	シン		Giving a girl <em>flowers</em> is like lighting the<strong> wick</strong> to her <em>heart</em>.	My favorite are heart shaped candles that smell like sweet flowers. The trick is to find one with a thick<strong> wick</strong>, they give off the most flower scent (but burn the quickest).	"My girlfriend jabbed a long-stemmed <em>flower</em> into my <em>heart</em>, then lit it like a<strong> wick</strong>. She had a funny way of saying ""I love you""."	"替芯 , 鉛筆の芯 , 芯を切る , 芯が腐っている <a href=""../v4/2368.html"">wick</a> (#2368 芯) シン … Parts:艹, 心 … Story:If you want to ""Dip You<strong> Wick</strong>"", then give Roses and pretend to open your <em>Heart</em> … 熟語 : … cf:."	Imagine a beautiful flower with a strange<strong> wick</strong> sticking out at the top. You ignite it - the flower turns into a heart!		
忠		loyalty	<i>In</i> the middle of a . . . <i>heart</i>.		8	648	602	22	チュウ		Their true <em>loyalty</em> exists <strong>in the middle</strong> of their <strong>hearts</strong>.	Your<strong> loyalty</strong> is to what's <em>in</em> your <em>heart</em>.	Hachiko, the most <strong>loyal</strong> dog of all, has a statue in his honor in the <strong>middle</strong> of the <strong>heart</strong> of Shibuya.	After the British soldiers executed the French archers, they dissected their bodies, only to find French flags INSIDE them, wrapping around their HEARTS. Now that shows true<strong> LOYALTY</strong>.	The evil genius guaranteed himself the<strong> loyalty</strong> of his minions by placing explosives <em>in</em> the <em>middle</em> of their hearts.		
串		shish kebab	This pictograph of two pieces of meat on a skewer, a <b>shish kebab</b>, will help us in the next frame.		7	649	603	22	カン、ケン、セン	くし、つらぬ.く	This is a pictograph if ever I saw one. Two chunks of meat on a skewer.	"Naka naka , ""who's there?""<strong> shish kebab</strong> …. ""shish kebab who?""."	"The actual definition of this kanji is ""<strong>a skewer</strong>,"" which I believe is much more helpful as a primitive. Just think, two <em>mouths</em> <strong>skewer</strong>ed on same <em>stick</em>."	The <strong>skewer</strong> that runs through the two junks of<strong> shish kebab</strong>.	Pictograph, see book.		
患		afflicted	Shish kebab . . . heart.		11	650	604	22	カン	わずら.う	A person who is<strong> afflicted</strong> with the vampire disease can only be killed with a <em>sheesh-kebab</em> through the <em>heart</em>.	If you eat too many <em>shish kebabs</em>, your <em>heart</em> will be<strong> afflicted</strong> with cholesterol.	If you are<strong> afflicted</strong> with severe <em>heart</em>burn, eating a spicy <em>shish kebab</em> will feel only slightly less painful than having it jammed straight into your <em>heart</em>.	A person who has been truly<strong> afflicted</strong> with the pain of love feels as if a giant <em>shish kebab</em> has been shoved through their <em>heart</em>.	A <em>skewered heart</em> is<strong> afflicted</strong> with pain.		
思		think	Brains . . . heart.		9	651	605	22	シ	おも.う、おもえら.く、おぼ.す	<strong>Think</strong> with your <em>brain</em> NOT your <em>heart</em>.	To<strong> think</strong> is to use your brain over your heart.	<strong>Think</strong>ing too much with our brains, and not enough with our hearts, leads to many of our life's pains and sorrows. This kanji reminds us that<strong> think</strong>ing, while an activity of the brain, should always have the support of the heart.	<strong>Think</strong>ing requires the <em>brain</em> and the <em>heart</em>.	<strong>Think</strong> with both your brain and your heart.		
恩		grace	Take <b>grace</b> in its sense of a favor freely bestowed, not in its meaning of charming manners or fluid movement. The primitives: <i>cause</i> . . . <i>heart</i>.		10	652	606	22	オン		<strong>Grace</strong> here is a favor freely bestowed, like a good deed. So to remember this kanji, go to the local shelter, find a <em>big dog pent up in a small cage</em> and adopt him. That will <em>cause</em> a warm feeling in your <em>heart</em>!	This kanji tells us that wherever heart is the cause,<strong> grace</strong> is the consequence. Think of “grace” as a<strong> grace</strong>ful act: something benevolent that comes from the heart.	<strong>Grace</strong> is when you give from your <em>heart</em> to serve a higher <em>cause</em>.	"A<strong> grace</strong> is a gift whose only <em>cause</em> for being given comes from the <em>heart</em>. WARNING: Do not confuse with <a href=""../v4/721.html"">graceful</a> (#721 淑) - this kanji and it's meaning have nothing to do with being<strong> grace</strong>ful."	<strong>Grace</strong> Kelly died be<em>cause</em> of her <em>heart</em> condition. I.e., her <em>heart</em> was the <em>cause</em>. It was because of all that dancing… that's how the story goes. But really, what happened is that she accidentally locked in her St. Bernard for 5 days without food, and when she came back home he ripped out and swallowed her heart.		
応		apply	"<i>Cave</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. The sense of the key word here is of something appropriate that fills a particular need, and hence ""<b>applies</b>."""		7	653	607	22	オウ、ヨウ、ノウ	あた.る、まさに、こた.える	"[bravo, scottamus!] To<strong> apply</strong> for the job as a (replacement) Batman, you have to make it to the <em>heart of the cave</em> past all the traps he set up to test you. There, you see a table with the application form on it. Now that you think about it, the ad in the paper did say ""Those who don't make it to the <em>heart of the cave</em> need not<strong> apply</strong>.""."	In the videogame Zelda, Link enters a CAVE to visit a fairy that will<strong> APPLY</strong> magic to fill his HEART containers.	"Heisig's keyword doesn't<strong> apply</strong> this kanji directly. 応用する （おうようする）means ""to<strong> apply</strong>"" as in <a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%BD%BC%E3%82%89%E3%81%AF%E6%96%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93%E3%82%92%E3%81%9D%E3%81%AE%E7%94%A3%E6%A5%AD%E3%81%AB%E5%BF%9C%E7%94%A8%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%80%82"">彼らは新しい科学技術をその産業に応用した。</a> ""They applied new technology to the industry."" The most common translation of 応 (on it's own without 用 ) might be ""respond"". As in responding to a question or responding to a situation. Story: Men are <em>CAVE</em>men at <em>HEART</em>. When confronted by emergency situations they RESPOND by<strong> APPLY</strong>ING their primitive power."	Said the doctor: Usual rules<strong> apply</strong>. If you<strong> apply</strong> too much force the <em>heart</em> will <em>cave</em> in.	Batman applied himself to catwoman deep in the <em>heart</em> of bat <em>cave</em>.		
意		idea	Sound . . . heart.		13	654	608	22	イ		When you get a good<strong> IDEA</strong> you get excited and you can hear the SOUND of your HEART, it's pounding so hard.	Picture someone who's just had a great<strong> idea</strong>, but in place of a blinking light bulb over their head, you see a <em>heart</em> thumping with great <em>noise</em>. Imagine the greater the<strong> idea</strong>, the louder the <em>sound</em> of the beating <em>heart</em>.	The best<strong> idea</strong>s are <em>sound</em><strong> idea</strong>s that come right from the <em>heart</em>!	The Frenchman René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laennec is best known for a great<strong> idea</strong> he had in 1816, when he invented a device to listen to the <em>sound</em> of a patient's <em>heart</em>: the stethoscope. Until then, doctors simply put their ears against people's chests, which was ineffective for overweight patients and embarrassing for female patients. Laennec's<strong> idea</strong> was so great that doctors still rely on it today.	A good <strong>idea</strong> will always <em>sound</em> right in your heart.		
臆		cowardice	Flesh . . . idea.		17	655	2460	22	オク、ヨク	むね、おくする	<strong>Cowardice</strong> is the situation where you get the thought that maybe running away and saving your <em>flesh</em> is a good <em>idea</em>.	<strong>Cowardice</strong> is when you are not willing to sacrifice your <em>flesh</em> for your <em>ideas</em>.	"A real brave person would never put their <em>flesh</em> before their <em>ideas</em>. That's why so many people have been killed - for example, in China, where people showed<strong> cowardice</strong> in the face of capitalism. They weren't willing to put their <em>flesh</em> behind their <em>ideas</em>. Note that <em>flesh</em> is the ""strong"" or ""main"" radical in this kanji, which lets you know that this person is emphasizing <em>flesh</em>, and thus, exhibiting <em>cowardice</em>."	"""Er, I've got a good <em>idea</em>, let's hide on the <em>moon</em>"" says the <strong>cowardly</strong> Shaggy in Scooby Doo ( 臆病な )."	"Man 1: ""Hey, enough with the dumb ideas!"" Man 2:""Dumb ideas?! I am just trying to save our flesh!"" Man 1: ""You coward!""."		
想		concept	"To distinguish this kanji from that of the previous frame, focus on the sense of the ""con-"" in the word ""<b>concept</b>."" Its elements are: <i>inter-</i> . . . <i>heart</i>."		13	656	609	22	ソウ、ソ	おも.う	The<strong> concept</strong> of love is basically two <em>hearts</em> <em>inter</em>-acting as one.	<em>''Inter-heart''</em> is a new therapy <em>CONCEPT</em> that helps macho guys share their feelings with each other.	Newton realised the<strong> concept</strong> when he was sitting under a <em>tree</em>, and an apple smacked him in the head. He stood up, <em>eyes</em> wide, <em>heart</em> racing, for he had discovered gravity!	When you find a<strong> concept</strong> that really moves you, such as the <strong>concepts</strong> of mercy, forgiveness and compassion, the reason they do so is the fact that the mental component of these <strong>concepts</strong> <em>inter-</em>act with your <em>heart</em> (to avoid mixing up the keywords for idea and<strong> concept</strong>, remember: <em>sound</em> idea, <em>inter-</em>esting<strong> concept</strong>).	When you finally manage to explain a difficult<strong> concept</strong> to someone, it feels as if your <em>hearts</em> are <em>inter-</em>connected.		
息		breath	Nose . . . heart.		10	657	610	22	ソク	いき	Your<strong> breath</strong> brings oxygen in through your <em>nose</em> which is then pumped around your body by your <em>heart</em>.	I think I've met my dream girl, but there's a problem. her<strong> breath</strong> is horrible! So, do I listen to my <em>nose</em> or my <em>heart</em>?	"From Genesis 2:7 (NKJV): Creating man. God ""breathed into his <em>nostrils</em> the<strong> breath</strong> of life and the man became a living being."" (can't you see his <em>heart</em> start pumping?)."	<strong>BREATH</strong> brings oxygen from your <em>nose</em> to your <em>heart</em>.	Someone has almost drowned. We plug their NOSE as we<strong> breath</strong> into them, then listen to see if the HEART starts beating.		
憩		recess	<i>Tongue</i> . . . <i>nose</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. The sense of <i>breath</i> from the last frame should not be used; it could lead you to put only the <i>nose</i> over the <i>heart</i> and leave the <i>tongue</i> off to one side.		16	658	611	22	ケイ	いこ.い、いこ.う	<strong>Recess</strong> to me is a school break. At<strong> recess</strong> some kiddies are comparing their latest body piercings. <em>Tongues</em> and <em>noses</em> are nothing special. The new cool is to have your <em>heart</em> done!	At<strong> recess</strong>, little boys stick their <em>tongues</em> out and pick their <em>noses</em> while little girls draw <em>hearts</em> on the ground with chalk. It's winter now, so any <em>tongues</em> –left– out for too long will freeze.	Ah<strong> recess</strong>; <em>tongues</em> slandering, <em>noses</em> being turned up, and beneath it all, young <em>hearts</em> being broken. Dominant in playgrounds is the noise of <em>tongues</em>, which helps me remember that in this kanji <em>tongue</em> comes first.	The<strong> recess</strong> is a remote place for meditation. You sit meditating with other monks, breathing though your nose, holding your tongue (keeping quiet), and finding peace in your heart.	"At<strong> recess</strong>…tongues flapping , noses running, hearts racing. wheeee! 休憩 きゅうけい　Imagine the skinny teacher from The Simpsons saying ""we're gonna have<strong> recess</strong> now children, nnnkay"". けい."		
恵		favor	<i>Ten</i> . . . <i>fields</i> (or: <i>needle</i> . . . <i>brains</i>) . . . <i>heart.</i>		10	659	612	22	ケイ、エ	めぐ.む、めぐ.み	Too easy. Imagine the Wizard of OZ. There, the three heroes asked the Wizard for three<strong> FAVOR</strong>S: the lion wanted courage of TEN men, the scarecrow wanted a BRAIN, and the tin man wanted a HEART. Ok, the lion bit is stretching but you have it memorized now, so who cares?	"If you would give someone 10 fields as a<strong> favor</strong> then you truly have a big heart. Or, people who do lots of<strong> favor</strong>s for others have a heart as big as 10 fields, a ""10-field-heart""."	"""Igor, do me a<strong> favor</strong>: go down to the morgue and pick me up <em>ten</em> <em>brains</em> – oh, and a <em>heart</em>, if they have any fresh!""."	-Do me a<strong> FAVOR</strong>, give me TEN FIELDS (I am talking to someone who owns a lot of fields), and I will thank you from my HEART !	"""Ten fields and my heart for my lady's<strong> favor</strong>!"" cried Lord Fancypants."		
恐		fear	Craft . . . mediocre . . . heart.		10	660	613	22	キョウ	おそ.れる、おそ.る、おそ.ろしい、こわ.い、こわ.がる	"If your heart surgeon is mediocre in his craft, you have plenty of reason to<strong> fear</strong>. (""Oops, I think I left my scissors in there"")."	My deep dark<strong> fear</strong> at the bottom of my <em>heart</em> is that I am <em>mediocre</em> at my <em>craft</em>.	Some have called the US the culture of<strong> fear</strong>.<strong> Fear</strong> is a craft that mediocre leaders use to control the hearts of the populace.	I have an unusual<strong> fear</strong> - when I'm sleeping, the <em>mediocre I-beam</em> above my bed will fall and crush my <em>heart</em>. The builder was certainly mediocre, the I-beam is not even quite straight! Could fall any time…	<strong>Fear</strong> will <em>craft</em> a <em>mediocre</em> <em>heart</em>.		
惑		beguile	The first three elements, <i>fiesta</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>floor</i>, appeared together once already in frame 380. Beneath them, once again, the <i>heart</i>.		12	661	614	22	ワク	まど.う	She was <strong>beguiled</strong>/<strong>mislead</strong> by his charm: at the party he kissed her on the <em>mouth</em>, they did it on the <em>floor </em>and thus he stole her<em> heart</em>. Poor girl!	"The same cowboy from frame # 356 (elements mouth, floor and fiesta), kisses the floor with his mouth, once again, before going to the fiesta. There, he uses his good looks to<strong> beguile</strong> women (gets them to buy him drinks or such), by playing with their hearts."	"I like to think of this character as Guile from Street Fighter 2, <strong>beguiling</strong> Chun Li at the <em>fiesta</em>. He kisses her on the <em>mouth</em>, they do it on the <em>floor</em>. Then, remembering his job, he rips out her <em>heart</em>, Mortal Kombat style. ""which character are you gonna be?"" ""I'm gonna <strong>be Guile</strong>"" (Partly inspired by nilfisq's)."	This kanji actually means <strong>BEWILDERED</strong>. At the fiesta, he was kissing the floor with all his heart. Everyone was <strong>bewildered</strong>.	At the fiesta I decided to<strong> beguile</strong> the crowd by performing a trick where I pull out my heart and throw it on the ground. It worked, their mouths hit the floor!		
感		emotion	Mouths . . . marching . . . heart.		13	662	615	22	カン		<strong>Emotion</strong> is a <em>march of mouths</em> inside your <em>heart</em> telling you what to feel.	Strong<strong> EMOTION</strong>S don't stay hidden. They march right out of one's <em>heart</em> (below) and out <em>one</em>'s <em>mouth</em> (shouted, snarled, or gently whispered - depending on exactly what kind of<strong> emotion</strong> it is!).	When you get<strong> emotion</strong>al, words come marching out of your mouth from your heart, and it's impossible to stop them.	Picture a site that consists solely of emoticons (represented by the mouth) marching across the screen - you know, hundreds of them. Imagine how much this website would slow down your computer. At this point you might consider stabbing the site's creator in the heart. (inspired by taijuando).	Emoticons held a <em>march</em> to protest against their low status in communication. Along went all those <em>little mouths</em>, shouting as <em>one</em>, riding not on horses but big squidgy <em>hearts</em>, bouncing one pace with each beat. Sadly, many were 'tired and<strong> EMOTION</strong>al' (<em>euphemism for 'drunk' in the British Press</em>) and they all started squabbling, at which point the march fell apart.		
憂		melancholy	<i>Head</i> . . . <i>crown</i> . . . <i>heart</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i>. Two things merit mention here. First, the doubling-up of the last stroke of <i>head</i> with the top of the <i>crown</i> serves to make the whole more aesthetically beautiful. It happens so rarely that the exceptions are easily learned. Second, try to make a single image out of the four elements. (Religious statuary of <b>melancholy</b> figures should offer plenty of suggestions.)		15	663	616	22	ユウ	うれ.える、うれ.い、う.い、う.き	<strong>Melancholy</strong> makes me think of Hamlet cause he was so 'emo'. In order to play up his feelings he bares his <em>head</em> and holds his <em>crown</em> over his <em>heart</em> then walks (on <em>walking legs</em>) around the palace making everyone see how<strong> melancholy</strong> he is. What a wuss.	This is an image of the crucifixion. Jesus is on the cross. His <em>crown</em> of thorns has slipped down and is around his neck, right between his <em>head</em> and his <em>heart</em>. His <em>walking legs</em> can be seen dangling from the cross as well. How<strong> MELANCHOLY</strong>!	In the middle of <em>summer</em> you lose both your <em>crown</em> and your <em>heart</em>. No wonder you feel<strong> melancholy</strong>.	In the<strong> Melancholy</strong> of Suzumiya Haruhi, reality was all in her <em>head</em>, leading to situations where her melancholic feelings in her <em>heart</em> would be released into bubble-like <em>crowns</em> of negative space where they'd <em>walk around on their legs</em> and wreck havoc.	The most<strong> melancholy</strong> places of all is a funeral. This is a funeral for the Burger King guy, where everybody takes the paper <em>crowns</em> that they were given off of their <em>head</em> and covers their <em>heart</em> with it. <em>Each</em> person then uses their <em>walking legs</em> to come up to the casket and throw in a whopper.		
寡		widow	<i>House</i> . . . <i>head</i> . . . <i>dagger</i>. Immediately we get another instance of a very odd exception. Notice how the final stroke of the head is lengthened, giving the final two strokes a chance to stretch out and make room for the <i>dagger</i> that fits in beneath.		14	664	617	22	カ		The new<strong> widow</strong> sits in the <em>house</em>, her <em>head</em> in her lap (the extended stroke), her <em>dagger</em> in her husband.	The <em>house</em>'s <em>head</em>, her husband, was murdered with a <em>dagger</em>. You can still see the drops of blood above the dagger. She is now a<strong> widow</strong>.	Extending Megaqwerty's story, the<strong> widow</strong> sits in the house with her head leaned forward in her lap so that her long pig-tails are stretched out to the floor. In between her pig-tails lies the dagger used to kill her husband.	"The<strong> widow</strong> is <em>head of the house</em> now that she's been <em>part</em>ed from her husband. <a href=""../v4/781.html"">part</a> (#781 分)."	After I found my husband in the <em>house</em> with his <em>head</em> chopped off by a <em>dagger</em>, I realised I'd become a<strong> widow</strong>.		
忙		busy	State of mind . . . perish.		6	665	618	22	ボウ、モウ	いそが.しい、せわ.しい、おそ.れる、うれえるさま	"<strong>Busy</strong> (as in ""occupied"") means a <em>state of mind</em> where all other thoughts are <em>perished</em>."	"^^^Make the ""state of mind"" primitive <em>Data (from Star Trek)</em> instead right now and save yourself the headache; 'state of mind' is too vague! (<em>Data</em> can stay so <strong>busy</strong> as not to sleep without <em>dying</em>. He's a robot)."	"Some people who are workaholics say, ""I can rest when I'm dead."" That is the sort of state of mind a<strong> busy</strong> person has!"	Poor Japanese people are so<strong> busy</strong>. They work like 80 hour weeks! Slowly, you see them turn into automatons…their bodies still alive, but their <em>state of mind</em> like they've long ago <em>perished</em>… (Mental image: most stressed out salaryman you know.).	"As others have suggested, I personified ""state of mind"" as the android, Data from here on. He is constanly analysing humans and emotions, plus he has an overactive mind for good measure. — <em>Data's</em> is<strong> busy</strong> trying to understand why do humans <em>perish</em> (die). — (If it helps bring Data to mind, think of ""<em>Data</em>-base is<strong> busy</strong>, please try again later"")."		
悦		ecstasy	State of mind . . . devil.		10	666	619	22	エツ	よろこ.ぶ、よろこ.ばす	<strong>ECSTASY</strong> alters our STATE OF MIND and makes us DEVILS.	The state of mind that horny teenagers are looking for.	The <em>devil</em> sells <em>Data</em> some <strong>ecstasy</strong> saying it will make him, like, human, man.	"Someone offers you<strong> ecstasy</strong> at a rave party. Cool, logical <em>Data</em> is on one shoulder saying ""No, don't take it!"". The <em>devil</em> is on your other shoulder saying ""You know you want it!""."	Data was in a state of<strong> ecstasy</strong> on the holodeck when he loaded up the new program full of horny teenagers that he stole from Riker.		
恒		constancy	State of mind . . . span.		9	667	620	22	コウ	つね、つねに	<strong>Constancy</strong> is holding the same <em>state of mind</em> over a long <em>span</em> of time. (tweaking PepeSeco and mspertus).	<em>Data</em> is the epitome of <strong>constancy</strong>. As a robot, his consistency <em>spans</em> the entire day.	A term used by Kant. Kant says that humans are preconditioned to experience the world in space and time, but God's mind has<strong> Constancy</strong>. That is, God's is a state of mind that spans all time and is not inhibited by it.	Imagine a giant field of grass where a man sits trying to abtain zen, he sit still as a statue, holding his fingertips against eachother, while the day and night (the <em>span</em>ning of the day) shoot pass you like in a 100000x forwarded movie. the seasons change but yet the man does not move. that whole picture combined gives me a feel of<strong> constancy</strong>.	"<em>Data</em> couldn't break the <em>span</em> of his<strong> CONSTANCY</strong> of his <em>state of mind</em> (ooh double reinforcement) if he tried. Just watch: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMWoaHyIKMs"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMWoaHyIKMs</a> See? He is serious from dusk to dawn. He can't break that serious look for one moment."		
悼		lament	To keep this character distinct from others of similar connotation, one need only think of the Prophet Jeremiah whose poetry gave an <i>eminence</i> to <i>the state of mind</i> we call <b>lamentation</b>.		11	668	621	22	トウ	いた.む	When the world's most <em>eminent</em> magician died, everyone's <em>state of mind</em> became that of<strong> lament</strong>ation. He was buried with his famous sun-flower wand in his hand.	<em>Data</em><strong> lament</strong>s that he could never see his <em>eminent</em> father, his creator, ever again. He paints a picture of his father, that looks like a sunflower in the shape of a magic wand.	Closely related to grief, mourning and regret, it was difficult for me to isolate this kanji. A<strong> lament</strong> is a song or poem that deals with loss or regret. This brings to mind the works of the world's most <em>eminent</em> artists, their brilliance and powerful works owed to their <em>emotional states of mind</em>.	<strong>Lament</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> most <em>eminent</em> people live in, because so many expectations lay on their shoulders.	Instead of using eminent - use its components - <em>divining rod</em> and <em>sunflower</em>. Think of the current state of the environment symbolized by the sunflower and use the divining rod to see the possible future - pollution, global warming, overpopulation - we have a lot to<strong> lament</strong>.		
悟		enlightenment	"I know of an Indian religious sect which teaches that <b>enlightenment</b> is to be had by covering the eyes with one's index fingers, the ears with the thumbs, and the mouth with the little fingers. While these differ a bit from the <i>five holes</i> that we used to represent the ""<i>I</i>"" (frame 17), the idea of achieving a special <i>state of mind</i> by covering those five places can help you learn this kanji. You might try the position out while you are learning this character."		10	669	622	22	ゴ	さと.る	<strong>Enlightenment</strong> is a state of mind that goes beyond the five senses.	"<em>Data</em> finds <strong>enlightenment</strong> when he discovers the answer to the question, ""Who am <em>I</em>?"". (Image: <em>Data</em> meditating in a sitting lotus position)."	Enlightment, a <em>state of mind</em> that <em>I</em> must find. Only <em>I</em> can find this <em>state of mind</em>.	What the hell is liosama talking about? (under me).	Heisig's was so perfect, getting all that saliva in on my pinkies after having been caught by my mother doing some absolutely stupid sign while looking at a book has shown her that i've reached enlightment too, she walked out. To be honest i would have rather been caught doing something less… obscure..		
怖		dreadful	State of mind . . . linen.		8	670	623	22	フ、ホ	こわ.い、こわ.がる、お.じる、おそ.れる	Someone in a<strong> dreadful</strong> <em>state of mind</em> has crawled into his bed and is hiding under the sheets (<em>linens</em>).	From the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy:<strong> Dreadful</strong>: (n) The <em>state of mind</em> of a frood who doesn't have a <em>towel</em> at his side.	Being an android, <em>Data</em> is white as a <em>sheet</em>. Doctor Crusher always has to remind herself that this is perfectly normal. From a doctor's perspective, he really does look<strong> dreadful</strong>.	What would be your state of mind after seeing some linen animate and fly down a hallway (a ghost) ? Surely, full of dread. Hence,<strong> dreadful</strong>. Picture someone experiencing dread, trying to reach for the big switch on top of their head, to turn off their mind because they are so scared.	"<em>Data</em> goes to the holodeck and loads up <strong>dread</strong>. He's suddenly in a haunted gothic mansion, and a stereotypical ghost made of a mere <strong>linen sheet</strong> flies at him. ""I do not understand this human emotion of dread. This is merely a sheet"" he says."		
慌		disconcerted	State of mind . . . laid waste.		12	671	624	22	コウ	あわ.てる、あわ.ただしい	(re: wazzab) The <em>state of mind</em> of the people of New Orleans as they examined their city's concert hall <em>laid waste</em> can best described as<strong> disconcerted</strong>.	"When I am<strong> disconcerted</strong> my <em>state of mind</em> is ""<em>laid to waste</em>""."	"Data walks in and sees Picard weeping. ""What is the matter, Captain?"" Picard looks up, and replies that his entire home planet has been <em>laid to waste</em>. Data, the master of tact, offers up this consolation: ""Ah. I can see how that would be <strong>DISCONCERT</strong>ing"". It turns out that the <em>flow of tears</em> was really just because Picard had lost his chance at getting at some rare (and thus valuable) <em>flowers</em> on his home planet."	In this kanji we see a<strong> disconcerted</strong> as a mind which has been laid waste by a flood of contradicting information. Try to picture someone's head being flooded, looking left and right in disconcert, and the switch on top of their head turning on and off uncontrollably.	"<em>Data</em> was<strong> disconcerted</strong> to find that he had been <em>laid waste</em> in a robot scrap yard. ""This is very disconcerting"", he says in the calmest possible manner given his unfortunate predicament. Make sure you see him there, looking around trying to analyse how his Captain could have abandoned him."		
悔		repent	<i>State of mind</i> . . . <i>every</i> (See frame 497).		9	672	625	22	カイ	く.いる、く.やむ、くや.しい	"""For all have sinned…"" so <em>every</em>one's <em>state of mind</em> should be to<strong> repent</strong>."	When you<strong> repent</strong>, you heal your <em>state of mind</em> by going over <em>every</em> thing you regret doing.	<strong>Repent</strong>: the state of mind that everyone here will share when they get their 2000 star trek stories mixed up.	"Data in the confessional: the minister says ""repent every sin"". Unfortunately for the minister, Data has perfect memory storage, so he really<strong> repent</strong>s EVERY sin. ""On Jan 1, i stepped on a bacteria, on Jan 2 I forgot to put the toilet seat down…""."	"An evangelical minister screams at <em>Data</em> to, <strong>Repent</strong> of <em>every</em> sin!!"" Data just replies that there is not 'every' sin to<strong> repent</strong> from since as a robot, he cannot sin."		
憎		hate	State of mind . . . increase.		14	673	626	22	ゾウ	にく.む、にく.い、にく.らしい、にく.しみ	Like the saying goes,<strong> Hate</strong> just begets<strong> Hate</strong>. A state of mind that just increases and increases until it explodes.	Your <em>state of mind</em> would turn to<strong> hate</strong> when someone would take away a loved one that was <em>formerly</em> yours.	<em>Data</em>'s one true emotion is <strong>hate</strong> for <em>Prince's</em> music. (Image: Data hunched over hands to his ears and screaming while Picard bobs to Purple Rain).	<strong>Hate</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> that turned the man who was <em>formerly</em> Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader.	<strong>Hate</strong> is unfortunately a <em>state of mind</em> on the <em>increase</em> in today's society. You may picture<strong> hate</strong> as a green face with red eyes, multiplying wildly (see frame 501 “formerly”). If the mnemonic doesn't do the job, add the <em>state-of-mind</em> switch.		
慣		accustomed	State of mind . . . pierce.		14	674	627	22	カン	な.れる、な.らす	Some hardcore monks have a <em>state of mind</em> that has become<strong> accustomed</strong> to their self-torture through <em>piercing</em> themselves.	"It took him awhile, but Data finally got<strong> ACCUSTOMED</strong> to his <em>nipple/breast piercings</em>. They were constantly rubbing up against his shirt and his <em>heart-shaped locket</em>. Picture <em>Data</em>, shirtless, squeezing his nipples in front of Picard and saying ""Yes, at first they were a bit shelly, but I've grown quite<strong> ACCUSTOMED</strong> to them"". That last bit should do it for you."	At first I thought that seeing people getting so many piercings was gross, but as time goes by your state of mind gets<strong> accustomed</strong> to it.	The previous generations had the <em>state of mind</em> that <em>piercings</em> were outlandish, but now the general public has become<strong> accustomed</strong> to this practice.	Through a trained <strong>state of mind</strong> one can become<strong> accustomed</strong> to being <strong>pierce</strong>d by sharp objects.		
愉		pleasure	<i>State of mind</i> . . . <i>butchers</i> (See frame 307).		12	675	628	22	ユ	たの.しい、たの.しむ	At the <em>meeting of butchers</em>, in their narrow <em>state of mind</em>, they throw lame jokes around like, 'Oh hello, it's a<strong> pleasure</strong> to <em>meat</em> you', and find this rather pleasing.	Image : <em>Data</em> attending a <em>meeting of the butchers union</em>. As a joke to begin his speech he says, 'Its a <strong>pleasure</strong> to MEAT you all.' (thanx to Shibo & nestOr).	Manson? Bundy? Jack the Ripper? Whichever killer or <em>butcher</em> brings to mind the most graphic image (maybe a meeting of all of them?) - you won't forget this kanji as you peer into their deranged <em>state of mind</em>: can't you just see their vacant stares and smiles on their faces, while they takes great<strong> PLEASURE</strong> in plying their trade? Creepy.	A <em>meeting of butchers</em> has dissolved into an orgy of blood-squirting violence. But since the killing <em>state of mind</em> is the highest<strong> pleasure</strong> a butcher can experience, they are all smiles.	<strong>Pleasure</strong> is the state of mind when flesh meets flesh (especially when one flesh is sabre-like).		
惰		lazy	"<i>State of mind</i> . . . <i>left</i> (i.e. ""sinister"") . . . <i>flesh</i>."		12	676	629	22	ダ		When I am in a<strong> LAZY</strong> <em>state of mind</em> I use my <em>left</em> hand to play with my <em>meat</em>…it feels like someone else is doing it, which is good cause I'm to<strong> lazy</strong> to get a date.	When in a<strong> lazy</strong> state of mind, the things you need to do are left for next month.	This may only work for me, but I just think that the left side of my body is the<strong> lazy</strong> side. It sometimes takes over and puts my whole body in a<strong> lazy</strong> state of mind.	<em>Data</em> was just being <strong>lazy</strong> when he claimed the <em>left</em> side of his <em>body</em> had malfunctioned and he couldn't help.	"Picard notices that the Enterprise is off course, and shouts, ""<em>Data</em>! I told you to turn <em>left</em> at the <em>moon</em>! What happened?"" Data replies, with his characteristic eyebrow-raise, ""I don't know, sir. I just didn't feel like doing it. Is that what humans call….<strong> lazy</strong>?""."		
慎		humility	State of mind . . . truth.		13	677	630	22	シン	つつし.む、つつし、つつし.み	<strong>Humility</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> of accepting the <em>truth</em> about yourself - both favorable and unfavorable. (tweaked version of Raichu's).	<strong>Humility</strong> is a state of mind when you consider yourself in accordance with the truth (you neither boast nor demean yourself).	<em>Data</em>, who is convinced he is perfect, is taught a lesson in<strong> humility</strong> when Riker shows him how to extract truth from someone by placing them on a <em>workbench</em> and poking them in the <em>eye</em> with a <em>needle</em>. Data just didn't understand how to play with the person's state of mind.	<strong>Humility</strong> is <strong>the state of mind</strong> of accepting the <strong>truth</strong> no matter how much you don't like it.	<em>Data</em> has great <strong>humility</strong> even though he knows more <em>truth</em> than any human.		
憾		remorse	"<i>State of mind</i> . . . <i>emotion</i>. Hint: the etymology of ""<b>remorse</b>"" indicates a memory that returns again and again to ""bite at"" one's conscience and disturb one's peace of mind."		16	678	631	22	カン	うら.む	<em>Remorse</em> is the <em>state of mind</em> where I feel bad for what I did while I was tired and <em>emotional</em>!	"Tip: If you are confusing this keyword,<strong> remorse</strong>, with <a href=""../v4/625.html"">repent</a> (#625 悔) and <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1460"">regret/resentment</a> (#1460 恨), then note that<strong> rEMOrse</strong> contains EMOtion."	<em>Data</em> feels<strong> remorse</strong> for stealing the human <em>emotion</em> chip.	<em>Data</em> feels<strong> remorse</strong> for stealing the human <em>emotion</em> chip. So, he takes it out. Then his<strong> remorse</strong> is gone so he puts it back in.. Then he takes it out. This could go on for a while, couldn't it? (thanks jamiemw!).	This kanji shows<strong> remorse</strong> (regret) as a mind filled with emotions from the past, coming back to “bite at” one's conscience and disturb one's piece of mind.		
憶		recollection	State of mind . . . idea.		16	679	632	22	オク		<strong>Recollection</strong> is about bringing ideas back to your mind.	<em>Data</em>'s <strong>recollection</strong> powers are unparalled. He never loses a single <em>idea</em>.	I have no<strong> recollection</strong> of my <em>state of mind</em> from last night, dude… I must have been drunk or something. Do you have any <em>idea</em> what I did last night, man?	<strong>Recollection</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> where one brings <em>ideas</em> back in one's mind.	<strong>Recollection</strong> is a <em>state of mind</em> where old <em>ideas</em> are contemplated.		
惧		disquieting	State of mind . . . tool.		11	680	3015	22	ク	おそ.れる	When sitting through laser eye surgery, the surgeon <em>stretches</em> open your <em>eye</em> with a tight-fitting <em>tool</em>. The thought of a laser cutting through the lens of your eye within moments, and possibly blinding you in the case of a mishap, makes for a very<strong> disquieting</strong> <em>state of mind</em>.	<strong>Disquiet</strong>: The feeling <em>Data</em> gets when they bring out the <em>eye-stretching</em> tool to try to give him emotions by forcing him to watch disturbing movies (like they did to Alex in A Clockwork Orange).	<strong>dread</strong>: Dread is the state of mind when you see the odd tool made of stretched human eyes.	What is all that racket!? My <em>state of mind</em> is <strong>disquieted</strong> by <em>extended tool</em> use!	<strong>Disquieting</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> you get after seeing a table full of <em>tools</em> with little eyes staring at you.		
憧		yearn	Think of the <i>state of mind</i> you were in as a child with a particularly <i>juvenile</i> <b>yearning</b>.		15	681	2280	22	ショウ、トウ、ドウ	あこが.れる	A paedophile's <em>state of mind</em> is to<strong> yearn</strong> for <em>juveniles</em>.	A <em>juvenile's state of mind</em> tends to go apeshit when they see something they<strong> yearn</strong> for. Usually involving jumping up and down, tantrums, and other bullshit. (Imagine giving them a big backhand across the face.).	Whenever Data sees a computer he has a<strong> yearn</strong>ing to stand on top of it and act juvenile. He really has to control this<strong> yearn</strong>ing. Picture Data looking wistfully at a computer and imagining himself standing on top of it in a thought bubble to the right.	<em>Data</em><strong> YEARN</strong>S for <em>juveniles</em>- bad robot!	The <em>state of mind</em> of a <em>juvenile</em> tends to<strong> yearn</strong> for things like fortune or fame.		
憬		hanker	State of mind . . . scenery.		15	682	3016	22	ケイ	あこが.れる	I'm in a <em>state of mind</em> where I <strong>desire</strong> to see the <em>sun</em> over the <em>capital</em> for some nice <em>scenery</em> for a change (no more rain!).	Think of a commercial designed at making you <strong>hanker</strong> for the product they're advertising. See how they cleverly use that <em>scenery</em> to put you in the <em>state of mind</em> they desire.	A prison cell can be nice for a while, but after some time your <em>state of mind</em> will change and you will <strong>hanker</strong> for more <em>scenery</em>.	I'm often in a <em>state of mind</em> where I <strong>desire</strong> to see some beautiful scenery. That's why traveling is necessary to keep me in a good <em>state of mind</em>.	The <em>scenery</em> of Texas puts <em>Data</em> in the <em>state of mind</em> to<strong> hanker</strong> for a Roy's roast beef burger.		
慕		pining	<i>Graveyard</i> . . . <i>valentine</i>. Note carefully the stroke order of the <i>valentine</i> primitive.		14	683	633	22	ボ	した.う	<strong>Pining</strong>, yearn for… etc. Presumably for lost love. An easy one here, someone standing in the <em>graveyard</em>, placing an old <em>valentine</em> card amonst all the existing tributes.	Morticia and Gomez (of the “Addams Family”) are spending their <em>Valentine's</em> Day at the <em>graveyard</em>,<strong> pining</strong> for each other's affection.	Remember the dead parrot from Monty Python's parrot's sketch? The shop owner said that the Norwegian Blue was<strong> pining</strong> for the fjords! But of course it should have been put in the <em>graveyard</em> already. Poor buyer, he meant to give the bird away as a <em>valentine</em> present…	I am in the <em>graveyard</em> <strong>pining</strong> for my lost <em>valentine</em>.	Imagine an 'emo' kid<strong> pining</strong> away in a <em>graveyard</em> because his <em>valentine</em> didn't turn up… His emo make-up is running because he's crying now. (Emo kids like to hang out in graveyards 'because it's cool' or something and they were going to have a date there).		
添		annexed	Water . . . heavens . . . valentine.		11	684	634	22	テン	そ.える、そ.う、も.える、も.う	Hawaii is a little drop of <em>heaven</em> nestled in the <em>waters</em> of the Pacific, most often visited by honeymooners and valentines. It was<strong> annexed</strong> to the U.S.A. in 1959, and more recently to Japan as well– albeit only unofficially, and through private commercial holdings.	"Tip 1: 天 and 夭 (<em>heavens</em> and <em>sapling</em>) are different, but RTK confuses them. Sapling appears in numbers 634, 938, 2078, 2079, 2080, and all characters containing <em>angel</em> 喬 (429, 430, 1221, 2104, 2120, 2369). Tip 2: The kanji 添 means ""something added/attached"", so think of it as a building annex. Story: While in the <strong>Annex</strong> <em>water</em>ing <em>saplings</em>, you find a <em>valentine card</em> amongst them – addressed to you!"	He drank all the holy water, so god<strong> annexed</strong> his heart to heaven.	First learn 忝 【ＧＲＡＴＥＦＵＬ】 (I was very GRATEFUL to have recieved a VALENTINE straight from HEAVEN.) It's a rare kanji used in かたじけない which means grateful. Then 添 【ＡＮＮＥＸＥＤ】 (You should be GRATEFUL the city just<strong> ANNEXED</strong> some land and is building a new WATER park.).	You shed tears (<em>water</em>) as your departed <em>valentine</em> is <strong>annexed</strong> to the <em>heavens</em>.		
必		invariably	"First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the <i>heart</i>, even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph ""dividing"" <i>the heart</i> in half, then one has one of those <b>invariably</b> true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each <i>heart</i> is divided into two halves."		5	685	635	22	ヒツ	かなら.ず	You swear you'll be in love forever, but<strong> invariably</strong> there comes a time when your <em>heart</em> is <em>divided</em>.	For this kanji I<strong> invariably</strong> got the stroke order wrong. I nearly lost <em>heart</em>, but decided to <em>stick</em> (pun) to it. Then I noticed the order is 1) katakana ソ (altered slightly); 2) fishhook; 3) two drops. Now I<strong> invariably</strong> get it right.	A <em>stake</em> through the <em>heart</em><strong> invariably</strong> kills a vampire. (As a primitive this can take the meaning '<strong>vampire</strong>').	A heart that has been slashed becomes<strong> invariably</strong> altered forever.	When you say 'cross my heart', you will<strong> invariably</strong> keep your word.		
泌		ooze	<i>Water</i> . . . the <i>invariably</i> divided heart.		8	686	636	22	ヒツ、ヒ		Anything full of <em>water</em> will <em>invariably</em> begin to<strong> ooze</strong>.	When you pierce a <em>heart</em> with a <em>stake</em>, it <em>invariably</em> <strong>oozes</strong> <em>blood</em>.	The invariably divided heart is… oozing water? Is it crying because it is broken?	Heisig, your a great man. Don't let people tell you overwise. Don't let them get you down ok?	When you <em>divide</em> Michael Phelps' <em>heart</em>, <em>water</em><strong> ooze</strong>s out instead of blood.		
手		hand	Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a <b>hand</b> in this character. But that it is, and so you must.	* Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single <i>hand</i> all by itself.	4	687	637	23	シュ、ズ	て、て-、-て、た-	This pictograph actually really works if you look at it as a<strong> hand</strong> with fingers spread and middle finger pointing down. see the very top stroke as the edge of a shirt cuff, and it will all come together.	A<strong> hand</strong> is useful for 千一 (1001) things.	Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. (the 6-fingered man).	Heisig says it's not a very good pictograph of a human<strong> hand</strong>, but it <em>is</em> a good pictograph of a cartoon<strong> hand</strong>. Picture Mickey Mouse's distinctive white glove with its three fingers and a thumb. The kanji that use this element can also use <em>Mickey Mouse</em> as a primitive element in place of <em>hand</em>.	The slightly bent <em>nail</em> went through <em>two</em> of the <strong>hand</strong>'s fingers (this one is pretty easy to memorize).		
看		watch over	Hand . . . eyes.		9	688	638	23	カン	み.る	It's a hot day of summer with a clear sky, you're sitting outside a cafe (or maybe on a reclining chair in the garden), and you<strong> watch over</strong> the kids with a hand covering your eyes from the sunlight (next time, don't forget the sunglasses).	Think of the monster from Pan's Labrynth, that <strong>watched over</strong> the poor girl with <em>eyes</em> in the palm of his <em>hands</em>.	I picture a lifeguard standing in his tower with his <strong>hand </strong>over his <strong>eyes</strong>, <strong>watching over</strong> the swimmers below (might work better for Australians- picturing that distinctive yellow and red cap).	My parents<strong> watch over</strong> me: whenever bad things are on the TV, they put a <em>hand</em> over my <em>eyes</em>.	"It's a Hamsa, that <strong>hand</strong> shaped trinket from the Middle East that <strong>WATCHES OVER</strong> the wearer and protects against the evil <strong>eye</strong>. If you've never seen one, check this out and this kanji is yours: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa</a>."		
摩		chafe	Hemp . . . hand.		15	689	639	23	マ	ま.する、さ.する、す.る	"If you grind the <em>hemp</em> without a stone but use your <em>hand</em> instead it will<strong> chafe</strong>. (Image: ""Robin, why are your hands all<strong> chafe</strong>d?"" 'Uh… (I've been grinding hemp all day)')."	Imagine sliding down a <em>hemp</em> rope, without gloves, just bare <em>hands</em>.<strong> Chafe</strong>s, doesn't it?	When the feds came to bust your little <em>hemp</em> <em>grove</em>, you jumped out the back side of the <em>cave</em> and tried to repel down with a <em>hemp</em> rope. Unfortunately, the rope<strong> chafe</strong>d your <em>hands</em> and you fell .. ouch!	Think of<strong> chafe</strong> in the sense of “friction” for this particular kanji. There are many garments made of <em>hemp</em> (though maybe not gloves). Contemporary <em>hemp</em> clothes are likely very comfortable, but for this story let's imagine rudimentary gloves which are coarse and rough like the unprocessed <em>hemp</em> fiber, and hence,<strong> chafe</strong> your <em>hands</em>.	Growing <em>hemp</em><strong> chafe</strong>s your <em>hand</em>s.		
我		ego	<i>Hand</i> . . . <i>fiesta</i>. Note how the second stroke of the <i>hand</i> is stretched across to double up as the first stroke of the tasseled arrow we use for <i>fiesta</i>. Compare to frames 17, 36, and 564.		7	690	640	23	ガ	われ、わ、わ.が-、わが-	"Someone with a huge<strong> EGO</strong> is too good for any romantic partner and as such has nothing but personal ""<em>hand</em> <em>fiesta</em>s"" with himself every night."	Did you hear about the guy who had such a big<strong> EGO</strong> that he threw a fiesta for his left hand?	At a truly excellent gay <em>fiesta</em>, <em>hands</em> are used to stroke more than just each other's <strong>egos</strong>. Graphic, perhaps … maybe even disturbing for a few of you more prudish/phobic types … but damned if it won't stick this way.	That guy has such a huge<strong> ego</strong>. He had to have a <em>hand</em> in everything to do with planning the <em>fiesta</em>.	The truly<strong> ego</strong>tistical prefer a <em>hand-fiesta</em> to anything anyone else can give them. Ok, its not a lovely image, but its kind of memorable. Big<strong> ego</strong>: <em>hand-fiesta</em>.		
義		righteousness	Sheep . . . ego.		13	691	641	23	ギ		Righteous Christians are sheep with egos (reworked from raulir, fixes word order to match radical order).	Follow the path of<strong> RIGHTEOUSNESS</strong> like <em>sheep</em> follow the shepherd , let go of your <em>ego</em>.	On the other hand, Woman tend to have too much self-<em>righteousness</em> to allow any man to touch their wooly black <em>sheep</em> this results in similar <em>hand</em> <em>fiesta</em>s.	Putting the lamb of God ahead of your own ego and seeking His will before all else. This is true<strong> righteousness</strong>.	"Christians believe one attains<strong> righteousness</strong> by elevating the Agnus Dei, or ""<em>Lamb</em> of God"", above the whims of one's <em>ego</em> (with thanks to axelb!)."		
議		deliberation	Words . . . righteousness.		20	692	642	23	ギ		Careful<strong> deliberation</strong> produces <em>words</em> of <em>righteousness</em>.	At the worst of times, a jury's<strong> deliberation</strong> descends into a war of <em>words</em> between competing self-<em>righteous</em>, power-tripping bastards.	"Picture Samuel L Jackson's character in Pulp Fiction carefully deliberating over what words to say to freak someone out before killing them. He even browses through a list of bible quotations for inspiration. Then he finds it!… ""the path of the righteous man""."	WARNING: This does NOT mean<strong> deliberation</strong> as in careful consideration before decision. It is the other definition of<strong> deliberation</strong>: formal consultation or discussion, as in 議会 , the Diet. In the<strong> deliberation</strong>s of the diet, only <em>Righteous words</em> are allowed. If you don't speak in <em>righteous words</em>, they kick you out of the discussion.	[+yorkii] Socrates, the righteous man that he is, is <strong>DELIBERAT</strong>ing on whether or not the sheep in front of him has an ego. He is also <strong>DELIBERAT</strong>ing on whether or not to give the sheep a <em>hand fiesta</em>. Tempting….		
犠		sacrifice	<i>Cow</i> . . . <i>righteousness</i>. Do NOT use the image of an animal <b>sacrifice</b> here, as that will have it own character later on.		17	693	643	23	ギ、キ	いけにえ	A cow that is righteous<strong> sacrifice</strong>s her milk for the human race.	<em>Cows</em> are truly <em>righteous</em> animals. They<strong> SACRIFICE</strong> their milk so that we can have some. And if they don't have any left, they give a <em>sheep</em> a <em>hand fiesta</em> (good lord this is going too far) and give us that instead. What <em>righteous</em> <em>cows</em>.	"There are two kanji that need to be kept separate: this one and <a href=""../v4/1559.html"">animal sacrifice</a> (#1559 牲). Think of it this way: here there is a <em>cow</em> and a <em>righteous</em> person (presumably a Hindu). One must be <strong>SACRIFICE</strong>d, so the righteous Hindu takes the place of the holy cow. But by the time frame 1559 rolls around, the Hindu is no longer alive to protect the cow, resulting in the <em>cow's life</em> ending in an <strong>animal<strong> sacrifice</strong></strong>."	Vegetarians<strong> sacrifice</strong> eating steak (<em>cow</em>) because they believe it is a <em>righteous</em> thing to do.	In the old testament times, <em>COWS</em> were<strong> SACRIFICE</strong> for <em>RIGHTEOUSNESS</em>.		
抹		rub	Fingers . . . extremity.		8	694	644	23	マツ		"I like to<strong> RUB</strong> my FINGERS over my EXTREMITIES ….like my extremity-ly long, umm, hair…. This has been edited in response to being reported …you can change ""hair"" to whatever extremity-ly long body part you like."	When you're cold, your<strong> RUB</strong> your FINGERS over your EXTREMITIES vigorously to warm up a bit. I'd still rather go in for a warm fire and some hot cocoa, though.	"Picture Mr. Burn's<strong> rub</strong>bing the <em>extremities</em> of his <em>fingers</em> together and saying ""excellent…""."	This is easy. What other <em>extremities</em> could you possibly use to<strong> RUB</strong> something? We use our <em>fingers</em>, of course. (I do appreciate the tendency to read perverted things into kanji, but sometimes a more logical approach is better).	"This means<strong> rub</strong> as in ""rubbed out"" or ""erased.""– 抹消 【まっしょう】 (n,vs) erasure; delete (e.g., DEL character); (P). 抹殺 【まっさつ】 (n,vs) erasure; denial; obliteration; ignoring (an opinion); (P) 抹茶 (P); 末茶 (iK) 【まっちゃ】 (n) powdered green tea for ceremonies; (P) STORY: Think of God using his huge FINGER to<strong> RUB</strong> OUT/ERASE the unnecessary EXTREMITIES of the world. Similarly to how a young child uses their finger to<strong> rub</strong> out an ant hole ant by ant."		
拭		wipe	Fingers . . . style.		9	695	2254	23	ショク、シキ	ぬぐ.う、ふ.く	Why carry a handkerchief? I <strong>wipe</strong> my nose <em>finger-style</em>.	It is not my STYLE to use my FINGERS to<strong> WIPE</strong> my butt.	If you are going to<strong> wipe</strong> your nose with your <em>fingers</em>, better do it in a grand <em>style</em>.	Using your <em>finger</em> is just one <em>style</em> of <strong>wiping</strong>. I use toilet paper.	We've all seen those hip-hop videos where they<strong> wipe</strong> their shoulder with their <em>fingers</em>, and it's supposed to be the height of <em>style</em>.		
拉		yank	"The sense of this key word is to pull or jerk, as in opening a door or making ""ramen"" noodles. Its elements: <i>fingers</i> . . . <i>vase</i>."		8	696	3017	23	ラ、 ラツ、 ロウ	くだ.く、 ひし.ぐ、 らっ.する	He quickly<strong> yank</strong>ed his <em>finger</em>s out of the <em>vase</em>. Maybe no one noticed the attempt to steal the cookies…	"As well as the meaning of 'taking captive', this also means 'crush' or 'batter'. One also often sees it written in Chinese, with the meaning ""pull"". (I think this is where 拉麺 comes from - 'drawn' or perhaps 'flattened' noodles.) My keyword is <strong>crush</strong> (I <strong>crushed</strong> my <em>fingers</em> trying to lift a heavy <em>vase</em>) but <strong>Ramen</strong> or the other common use for this kanji in Japanese, <strong>Latin</strong> (it's the abbreviation for the Latin language) would also be appropriate, as they help you learn the reading (ラ)."	He<strong> yank</strong>ed his <em>finger</em> out of the <em>vase</em> upon discovering it had a venus fly trap in it.	<strong>kidnapper</strong>: The kidnapper wraps his fingers around the vase and then smashes it on the kid’s head. They carry him away. He’s been kidnapped.	RTK supplement: <strong>yank</strong>: I <em>yank</em>ed with my <em>fingers</em> at my car's steering wheel to avoid hitting someone who was standing in the middle of the road carying a Ming <em>vase</em>. I ended up against a light pole. I was hoping that Chinese would still be intact, but the person got scared and let it fall down… in pieces…		
抱		embrace	Fingers . . . wrap.		8	697	645	23	ホウ	だ.く、いだ.く、かか.える	"When embracing someone, wrap your fingers around her butt for added effect. You may think of ""bound with snakes"" as a description of the fingers slithering around the buttocks, if you want a particularly graphic image."	Here, I'm picturing that scene from ET (the extra terrestrial), where ET hugs Elliot before leaving. You see that<strong> EMBRACE</strong> is ET's long FINGERS that WRAP around Elliot.	Ladies; for a truly intimate <strong>embrace</strong> your <em>fingers</em> should be <em>wrapped</em> around your man's….imagine <em>binding</em> his <em>snake</em> with your fingers.	King Kong's way to <strong>embrace</strong> Ann Darrow (the blond beauty) is to <em>wrap</em> his <em>fingers</em> around her. He is too huge to<strong> embrace</strong> her like everybody else.	"From 風の谷のナウシカ . Nausicaa is<strong> embrace</strong>d by the Ohm's <em>finger</em> like tenticles. The effect is very similar to raulir's ""bound with snakes"" image."		
搭		board	The key word refers to <b>boarding</b> vessels for travel. Its elements are: <i>finger</i> . . . <i>flowers</i> . . . <i>fit together</i> (See frame 270).		12	698	646	23	トウ		"Ok, this is a little wierd, but i took this back to the kanji for <a href=""../v4/254.html"">pagoda</a> (#254 塔).

When you<strong> board</strong> the ship on the way out from Hawaii a beautiful crewmember takes her <em>fingers</em> and fits a lei around you ….a lei is <em>flowers</em> <em>fitted together</em> with your <em>fingers</em>.	"A romantic scene. A woman stands near to her sailor, rolling the lone <em>flower</em> that he gave her between her <em>fingers</em> because she is sad that he must leave. When the time comes for the captain to shout, ""All aboard!,"" the sailor bends deeply forward to give her one final ""<em>meeting</em> of the <em>mouths</em>,"" powerful enough to cause her <em>flower</em> to drop out of her <em>fingers</em> and into the sea."	All aboard! <em>Fingers</em> waving goodbye, <em>flowers</em> tossed in the air, and the <em>meeting of mouths</em> as lovers say goodbye.	"A new torture technique called ""flower-boarding"" instead of the popular ""water-boarding"". It's quite simple: Use your fingers to make some flowers fit into the prisoner's mouth. Pretty effective!"		
抄		extract	Fingers . . . a few.		7	699	647	23	ショウ		You can<strong> extract</strong> her juices by inserting a <em>few fingers</em>.	The mafia want to<strong> extract</strong> information from you. You don't say a word, so out comes the knife. They cut of your fingers until you only have a few left and then you speak.	You are at a the university library preparing a summary of some litterature and with your thumb, index and little finger (a <em>few fingers</em>) you point at a <em>few</em> passages to<strong> extract</strong>. Note: this kanji is used in the sense of an “excerpt”, not of an<strong> extract</strong> of some substance.	Breaking a few fingers is an excellent way to<strong> extract</strong> information.	You've heard about that monkey who put his hand in the candy jar and grabbed so many pieces that he couldn't<strong> extract</strong> his hand? This Kanji is a lesson in how to<strong> extract</strong>, because if you put your <em>fingers</em> in the jar and only grab a <em>few</em>, then you will be able to<strong> extract</strong> them easily.		
抗		confront	Fingers . . . a whirlwind.		7	700	648	23	コウ		"Gandalf<strong> confront</strong>s the evil beast, shouting ""you shall not pass!"". He holds up a single finger and sends forth a whirlwind."	The<strong> confront</strong>ation between the two sign-language people looked like a whirlwind of fingers.	Imagine a thumb war. A<strong> confront</strong>ation of fingers in a whirlwind.	<em>Tornados</em> can smell fear. So next time one threatens your town, don't run away or hide like everyone else.<strong> Confront</strong> it! Just give it the <em>finger</em>, tell it to piss off, and watch as it fearfully runs away.	In his<strong> confront</strong>ation with Agent Smith, Neo first gave him the <em>finger</em>, then unleashed a <em>whirlwind</em> of lethal kung fu moves. 反抗 (はんこう) : opposition, resistance, insubordination, defiance, hostility, rebellion.		
批		criticism	Finger . . . compare.		7	701	649	23	ヒ		My<strong> criticism</strong> earned me the FINGER when I COMPARED her cooking to my mother's.	Think of the two most famous critics, Ebert and Roeper. On their show, they <em>compare</em> thumbs (which are technically <em>fingers</em>) with each other before dispensing<strong> criticism</strong>.	<strong>Criticism</strong> is pointing at your finger at someone and comparing them with someone perfect.	<strong>Criticism</strong> is a <em>comparison</em> of <em>fingers</em>: thumbs up or down.	I took it as a<strong> criticism</strong> when my girlfriend <em>compared</em> my…well, you know…to her pinky <em>finger</em>.		
招		beckon	Finger . . . seduce.		8	702	650	23	ショウ	まね.く	A Geisha<strong> beckon</strong>s you with her index <em>finger</em>, and as you approach she runs her <em>fingers</em> all over her body in an attempt to <em>seduce</em> you. Keyword meaning : “invite”.	I bet you all know the Maneki Neko, or <strong>beckon</strong>ing cat, who with its raised <em>fingers</em> tries to <em>seduce</em> all good things (success, happiness and harmony) to its owner.	The siren gently <strong>beckons</strong> you with her <em>finger</em> and <em>seduces</em> you to to your death.	This kanji actually means <strong>invite</strong>. A FINGER SEDUCTION is in fact an <strong>invitation</strong> for other things. Oh ho ho….. grrrr…	She/He <strong>beckoned</strong> me with her <em>finger</em>, <em>seductively</em>.		
拓		clear the land	Fingers . . . rocks.		8	703	651	23	タク	ひら.く	A huge index <em>finger</em> coming down from the sky is kicking boulders of <em>rock</em>,<strong> clear</strong>ing the land. Maybe it's the <em>finger</em> of God preparing a place for his little people to live.	I imagine <strong>clear</strong>ing <strong>the land</strong> in order to set up your tent after a long day of backpacking. Using your <em>fingers</em>, you pick up all of the <em>rocks</em> and get them out of the way so that you can get a comfortable night sleep. If you don't <strong>clear the land</strong> you can just picture the rock sticking into your back as you toss and turn all night long.	To<strong> clear</strong> the land, farmers use their fingers to get the stones out.	<strong>Clear</strong> the land reminds me of that game Harvest Moon and all those stones in the farm he had to pick up with his bare fingers to make room for crops. Until you get the might of the dwarves gloves to enhance your fingers grip ability (last explanation is to distinguish this from polish).	"Easy one, Palestinian children keep trying to<strong> clear</strong> (the land) from hostile Israelis by throwing STONES on them with their FINGERS. (<a href=""http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/uploads/faris-odeh2.jpg"">http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/uploads/faris-odeh2.jpg</a>)."

""Oh bravo old chap. Bravo…"")."	I<strong> clap</strong>ped so hard, my <em>fingers</em> became <em>white</em>.	<em>Fingering</em> someone with the<strong> clap</strong>, there is likely to be a lot of <em>white</em> puss in the general area you are working with…(Sorry for that! Fuaburice please feel free to delete this if it breaches any etiquette rules. This story is definitely not from personal experience!).	If your <em>fingers</em> have turned <em>white</em> it is probably time to stop <strong>clapping</strong>.	When you<strong> clap</strong>, the impact pushes the blood out of your hands, leaving them white momentarily.		
打		strike	Finger . . . spike.		5	705	653	23	ダ、ダアス	う.つ、う.ち-、ぶ.つ	"You're using a hammer to drive a <em>nail</em> into a plank, but you miss and<strong> strike</strong> your <em>fingers</em>, ouch ! PS: the character does not mean ""to go on<strong> strike</strong>"", it will be very helpful in the long run to create images that convey the proper sense of the character!"	My teacher used to<strong> strike</strong> my <strong>finger</strong>s with a <strong>street sign</strong>.	"To do the most damage when you<strong> strike</strong> someone, use your ""fingernail"" (<em>finger</em>-<em>nail</em>)."

Giving the police the <em>finger</em> and a colorful <em>phrase</em> is a surefire way to get<strong> arrest</strong>ed.	"While <em>finger</em>-cuffing you, the police officer points says the <em>phrase</em>, ""You're under <strong>arrest</strong>. You have the right to remain silent…""."	You are being<strong> arrest</strong>ed by a rookie cop. He has only just learned the Miranda warning, so he counts off the <em>phrases</em> on his <em>fingers</em> one by one: 1.

The wicked witch from Hansel and Gretel only likes the meaty parts of kids. Outside her candy <em>cottage</em>, you can see a pile of <strong>discard</strong>ed <em>fingers</em>.	This verb (suteru) is the one used for the ancient custom of 'baachan o suteru' - abandoning Granny in the mountains when feeding or caring for her became too much. Sadly, I can visualise many a victim clinging with her <em>fingers</em> to the <em>cottage</em> door and yelling that she doesn't want to go…	The wicked witch with a <em>cottage</em> of candy has trapped Hansel and every day she<strong> discard</strong>s him as her choice for dinner because his <em>finger</em> doesn't seem fat enough yet…	You<strong> discard</strong> a card and turn the next card over with your fingertips, and you win!!

拐		kidnap	Finger . . . mouth . . . dagger.		8	708	656	23	カイ		Wrap your FINGERS around someone's MOUTH to keep them quiet, then put the KNIFE to their throat to ensure their cooperation. This is the best way to<strong> KIDNAP</strong> someone.	"After you <a href=""../v4/650.html"">beckon</a> (#650 招) someone by seducing them, you<strong> kidnap</strong> them and hang them upside down (the reversed positions of <em>seduce</em>)."	<strong>Kidnap</strong>ping goes like this, after you<strong> kidnap</strong> somebody, you send one of their fingers. Then you hold a dagger before the mouth of the victim and have him talk so that people know he's still alive. This balance between cutting of fingers of the victim and having him say he's all right will make a successful<strong> kidnap</strong>ping. Join us next week on how to perform a good back-alley murder.	"You<strong> kidnap</strong> someone by putting a finger on your mouth (""ssh!"") and a dagger under his."	"<strong>Kidnap</strong>ping is related to, but opposite to <a href=""../v4/650.html"">beckon</a> (#650 招). If you beckon someone, you ask them to come to you, rather then going to them (to steal them). The kanji is an illustration of that fact, because the <a href=""../v4/11.html"">mouth</a> (#11 口) is above the <a href=""../v4/83.html"">sword</a> (#83 刀)."

When I was a baby, I thought my<strong> finger</strong>s were <em>delicious</em>.	Here we have the basis for <em>Colonel Sanders</em><strong> finger</strong> licking good Kentucky Fried Chicken. <em>Delicious.</em> (I use <em>Colonel Sanders</em> as the keyword for primitive 扌instead of <em>finger</em> because I always forgot <em>finger</em>. For such a common primitive, it's handy to have a person (the Colonel), place (the restaurant), and thing (the fried chicken) all available for story-making options.).

At a <em>Buddhist temple</em> people<strong> hold</strong> their <em>fingers</em> together in prayer.	Imagine a group of Japanese ppl visiting. What could their FINGERS possibly be doing while being in a TEMPLE –<strong> HOLD</strong>ING a camera.	Did you see Kung Fu Panda?

It always frightened me because I imagined getting my <em>tongue</em> stuck in the zipper.	On the plane, you refuse to<strong> FASTEN</strong> your seatbelt and even go so far as to give the stewardess the <em>finger</em> and stick out your <em>tongue</em> at her. The crew comes and pins you down and forces you to<strong> FASTEN</strong> it.	"A <em>finger</em> in front of your mouth means ""<strong>fasten</strong> your lips"" or ""hold your <em>tongue</em>""."	Imagine Quai gon Jin catching Jar Jar Binks' <em>tongue</em> with his <em>finger</em>s and<strong> fasten</strong>ing it to something.

He's riding in a <em>chariot</em> using the foam <em>finger</em> to kill his enemy.	"キ　Before the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the French threatened to cut off the middle finger of all captured Englishmen.

推		conjecture	Fingers . . . turkey.		11	716	663	23	スイ	お.す	In mathematics, a<strong> conjecture</strong> is a mathematical statement which has been proposed as a true statement, but which no one has yet been able to prove or disprove. Have you heard of the <em>Finger-Turkey</em><strong> conjecture</strong> ? It states that if <em>turkeys</em> had <em>fingers</em>, they would be able to count. Be sure to imagine a turkey with fingers at the tip of its wings, counting from one to ten.	In the midst of<strong> conjecture</strong> on whether it was done or not, mom stuck her <em>fingers</em> in the <em>turkey</em> to check.	WRONG<strong> conjecture</strong> -> Fingers evolved from turkeys.	"The correct<strong> conjecture</strong> is that <em>fingers</em> evolved INTO <em>turkeys</em>!

揚		hoist	Fingers . . . piggy bank.		12	717	664	23	ヨウ	あ.げる、-あ.げ、あ.がる	My piggy bank is so heavy that I cannot<strong> HOIST</strong> it using just my fingers.	Picture a major robbery where some dudes are breaking into a bank to steal their money. They get their man in the vault through the ceiling - now he's hanging from a rope a few feet from the ground (like in the movies, dodging laser beams). He reports back that he has found the loot, and its all in a large piggy bank in the center of the vault. The alarm sounds and he's got to think fast. He jams the four fingers of his right hand in the piggy bank slot and tells his team to<strong> hoist</strong> him up, he's got the loot!	You will be<strong> hoist</strong> by the neck if I catch you with your <em>fingers</em> in my <em>piggy bank</em> again! 唐揚げ からあげ deep fried food; 揚代 あげだい fee paid for the services of a geisha or prostitute; 揚々 ようよう triumphant, exultant, in high and proud spirits; 揚陸 ようりく landing, unloading.	A good way to keep your <em>piggy bank</em> brimming with coins away from the grubby <em>fingers</em> of your siblings is to get a pulley and<strong> hoist</strong> the thing high up in the air.	A crane<strong> HOIST</strong>S a giant <em>piggybank</em> into the air in the air as a mob of children reach up, <em>fingers</em> outstreached, trying to grab it.		
提		propose	Fingers . . . just so.		12	718	665	23	テイ、チョウ、ダイ	さ.げる	When a man<strong> PROPOSE</strong>S to a lady, he takes her FINGER and places the ring on it JUST SO, and the moment sweeps her away.	I tried to<strong> propose</strong> to my girlfriend, but the ring was too small to fit her <em>finger</em>. Instead of saying yes, she just uttered an annoyed sigh. So I rushed to the jeweler where he made it bigger. But now it was too big, so I rushed back to make it smaller. This spiel kept going on until the ring was finally <em>just so</em>. Her eyes lit up and she said yes.	When you<strong> propose</strong>, the ring you place on your fiance's <em>finger</em> better be <em>just so</em> (style/size/placement/etc.) or she'll reject your sorry ass.	Business proposals in Japan have to be set out just so. If you fail to lay them out in the correct way, you have to give up a finger, just like the yakuza. <em>NOTE</em> This is not the same type of<strong> propose</strong> as to<strong> propose</strong> for marriage, so I opted for a different direction.	"You raise your <em>finger</em> at a meeting, to<strong> propose</strong> things to be done <em>just so</em>. <em>NOTE</em> This is not the same ""propose"" as to ""propose for marriage""."

Try PICKING UP a girl by trying to FIT your FINGER in you know what… let me know how that works.	When you are trying to<strong> pick up</strong> a girl, don't get too excited and start <em>fingering</em> her before you have a <em>meeting of the mouths</em>.

One of the classic stories of<strong> shouldering</strong> a heavy burden is that of the kid who had to stick his <em>finger</em> on a dam until <em>nightbreak</em> to prevent it from breaking down.	A surgeon works 'til nightbreak, fingers working with precision,<strong> shouldering</strong> the responsibility of saving the life of the person on the operating table.	<strong>Shouldering</strong> the heavy burden of supporting one's family you work your <em>fingers</em> to the bone everyday till <em>nightbreak</em> comes.	"Atlas: ""Hey Hercules, my <strong>shoulders</strong> kind of hurt. Do you think you can take this globe off my <strong>shoulders</strong> until <em>nightbreak</em>, I've got a date with Aphrodite?

拠		foothold	Fingers . . . dispose.		8	722	669	23	キョ、コ	よ.る	When rockclimbing, when your weight <em>disposes</em> of the valuble<strong> foothold</strong>, all that's left is your <em>fingers</em> keeping you from death. Meanwhile, your <em>walking legs</em> are left dangling in the <em>wind</em>.	Once you have a good<strong> foothold</strong>, you can <em>dispose</em> of your <em>finger</em>hold.	If you lose your<strong> foothold</strong> you will have to hold on for dear life with your <em>fingers</em> as your <em>legs</em> are left dangling in the <em>wind</em>. (Inspired by aircawn.).	Break this down into its component parts here. Think of rockclimbing: you must place your <em>fingers</em> and <em>moving legs</em> carefully, always finding a secure<strong> foothold</strong> so that that <em>wind</em> can't knock you off the rock face.	While <em>disposing</em> of trash into a particularly large dumpster, I lost my<strong> FOOTHOLD</strong> and was left dangling from the dumpster by my <em>fingers</em>.

You chop off one of your FINGERs and plant it like a SEEDLING, planning to<strong> sketch</strong> it daily to show its progress. Unfortunately, all your<strong> sketch</strong>es are the same - fingers don't grow like that, you see… plus one of your hands is now a bloody mess and<strong> sketch</strong>ing doesn't come too easily with a paw like that. All in all, a very bad idea which has done nothing to hone your artistic talent; in fact, you have only impaired it.	Isn't <em>finger</em> paint great? This kanji shows a kid <em>finger</em> painting a<strong> sketch</strong> of a <em>flowery field</em>.	A <strong>sketch</strong> can be considered the <em>seedling</em> of a full-fledged technical drawing.

The muchachos are sleeping soundly, completely oblivious to the sound of dogs barking, guitar playing and even gun shots. Now imagine one tourist passing by and snapping his <em>fingers</em> and waking up all the <em>muchachos</em> at once.	"Just as I was finished <strong>putting up</strong> a ""no <em>siestas</em>"" <strong>notice</strong> on my property, a muchacho gave me the <em>finger</em>, sat down, and promptly fell asleep."	The Mexican piano tutor <strong>PUT UP A NOTICE</strong> that his <em>FINGERS</em> were tired and that he was going to take an extended <em>SIESTA</em>.	I used a <em>finger</em> and a thumbtack to<strong> put up</strong> a sign on my door to notify others that I was taking a <em>siesta</em> and was not to be disturbed. <strong>(think finger = thumb[tack] and this kanji is easy)</strong>.	"Keep your <em>fingers</em> crossed when you go to a shop in Italy: you might see the shop owner <strong>putting up a notice</strong>: ""closed because of <em>siesta</em>""."		
掛		hang	Fingers . . . ivy . . . magic wand.		11	727	674	23	カイ、ケイ	か.ける、-か.ける、か.け、-か.け、-が.け、か.かる、-か.かる、-が.かる、か.かり、-が.かり、かかり、-がかり	Think RPG. The wizard points his <em>finger</em> to the guard and the <em>ivy</em> he has just animated with his <em>magic wand</em> climbs down the wall to <strong>hang</strong> the poor guy, opening the way for the adventurers into the dungeon.	3 ways you could<strong> hang</strong> something: 1) the normal way, with your finger putting something on a hook or whatever, 2)<strong> hang</strong>ing from a vine the natural way, or 3) by means of the magic of the wand.	This kanji depicts 3 different ways to<strong> hang</strong> something: using your <em>fingers</em>, using<strong> hang</strong>ing <em>ivy</em>/rope, or with the flick of a <em>magic wand</em>. (much thanks to Darg Sama!).	Naked Tarzan is swinging through the jungle, gripping the ivy with his fingers, his wand<strong> hang</strong>ing out.	(<strong>Warning</strong> - <em>really</em> grotesque image ahead - <strong>Warning</strong>) Use your <em>fingers</em> to wrap the <em>ivy</em> rope around the convict's neck, and then see if there is any truth to the story about a man's, ahem, <em>magic wand</em> becoming swollen when executed by<strong> hang</strong>ing.		
捗		make headway	Let your <i>fingers</i> do the <i>walking</i> as you <b>make headway</b> through the Yellow Pages in search of something hard to find.		10	728	2269	23	チョク、ホ	はかど.る	"""Come on people, the only way to<strong> make headway</strong> in this business is to let your <em>fingers</em> do the <em>walking</em>!"" bust out the yellow pages and dial as many numbers as possible, surely someone is a sucker for a cold call sell."	You can't just point with a <em>finger</em> and<strong> make headway</strong>, you have to actually walk* there.	<em>Walking</em> on your <em>fingers</em> it's really difficult to<strong> make headway</strong> - any progress at all is very slow.	Even if you <em>walk</em> with your <em>fingers</em>, it's important to continue to<strong> make headway</strong> and never give up.	The best way to<strong> MAKE HEADWAY</strong>, is to let your FINGERS do the WALKING.		
研		polish	Stone . . . two hands.		9	729	675	23	ケン	と.ぐ	My <em>stones</em> are so huge that it takes <em>two hands</em> to<strong> polish</strong> them!	You use two hands to<strong> polish</strong> a stone: one to hold it and the other to rub it.	Scene from Karate Kid: Wax on (with one hand), wax off (with the other). But instead of using cloth he's using stones in his hand.	Cinderella <strong>polishing</strong> the <em>stone</em> floor with <em>both hands</em>.	To<strong> polish</strong> a katana you need two things: finest grade of <strong>polishing</strong> <em>stones</em>, and of course <em>two hands</em>. If you accidentally chop one off, your career as sword<strong> polish</strong>er is over. (once again I'm using this to remember the order of the elements - first stone, then two hands).		
戒		commandment	Two hands . . . fiesta.		7	730	676	23	カイ	いまし.める	Two hands, fiesta…..when moses received the ten<strong> commandment</strong>s with two hands, he went back down the mountain and threw a fiesta with the jews, celebrating the arrival of the<strong> commandment</strong>s.	"When Moses returned with the <strong>commandments</strong> in his <em>hands</em> he saw that his people were throwing a <em>fiesta</em>. At first he was excited. Then he looked around and got pissed. ""Awww, c'mon guys. Golden idols? Really?""."	The little-known 11th<strong> commandment</strong>: thou shalt have a two-handed fiesta every Saturday night. That's why Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest.	The 11th<strong> commandment</strong>: thy girlfriend shalt give thou <em>two-hand</em>ed <em>fiestas</em> every night.	"The last unofficial<strong> commandment</strong> ""Throw your hands in the air like you just don't care and <em>fiesta</em>!"		
弄		tinker with	Jewel . . . two hands.		7	731	2558	23	ロウ、ル	いじく.る、ろう.する、いじ.る、ひねく.る、たわむ.れる、もてあそ.ぶ	The <em>king</em> used <em>both hands</em> to<strong> tinker with</strong> himself in his spare time.	Picture the king holding a large pan in his two hands and tinkering with it, wishing he could lead the itinerant life of a tinker. As a rhyme: The <em>king</em>, he uses his <em>two hands</em>, To<strong> tinker with</strong> his pots and pans . . .	"Tinker seems to imply mending or working at something, which is wrong. This is more like ""to trifle with"". (The meaning of ""to trifle with"" is sufficiently different from ""trifle"" that there should be no confusion). The king can trifle with anything using his two hands (be it objects, his subjects, or himself)."	"When something new is invented, the king is always the first to be able to<strong> tinker with</strong> it. So picture yourself looking up at the <em>king</em> with <em>both hands</em> holding your new invention, only to have it <strong>tinkered with</strong> and broken by the king who would say nothing more than ""oh dear""."	The <em>king</em> wore jewels on <em>both hands</em> that had been <strong>tinkered with</strong> so that they contained poison.		
械		contraption	Tree . . . commandment.		11	732	677	23	カイ	かせ	The ten commandments were heavy. So to help carry them, Moses made a wooden<strong> contraption</strong>; the ark of the covenant.	Think of a complex <em>wood</em>en<strong> contraption</strong> capable of giving you a <em>two-handed</em> <em>fiesta</em>.	In the medieval days, all who broke the <em>commandment</em>s were locked up in a <em>wood</em>en <strong>contraption</strong>. (AKA <em>Wood</em>en Stocks).	<em>Tree</em>beard's <em>commandment</em> was that the ents destroy Sauromans layer and all of the magical<strong> contraption</strong>s therein.	The 12th <em>commandment</em>: Thou shalt create a<strong> contraption</strong> for masturbation out of <em>wood</em> large enough for God to use. You have 24 hours. Good luck.		
鼻		nose	Let me share a rather grotesque image to help with this kanji. Imagine taking your <i>two hands</i> and reaching up into someone's <i>nostrils</i>. Once inside you grab hold of the <i>brain</i> and yank it out. At the end, you would have a picture something like that of this character, the full kanji for <b>nose</b>.		14	733	678	23	ビ	はな	An Egyptian embalmer reaching <em>both hands</em> into the dead pharaoh's <strong>nose</strong> and yanking out handfuls of <em>brain</em>.	I sneezed so hard that through my<strong> NOSE</strong> I blew out my BRAINS into BOTH HANDS.	Remember when you had the flu, and you were sneezing all the time? I bet you thought that you could end up holding your <em>brain</em> in <em>both hands</em> after it was spitted from your running <em>nose</em>!	An addition to Heisig's story in order to remember the position of the elements: Everyone hates people that turn their<strong> nose</strong>s 'up' at people. This provides motivation to reach in through that turned up<strong> nose</strong> and drag out those brains with both hands.	<em>Oneself</em> may experience hay fever from <em>rice fields</em> requiring <em>two hands</em> to cover the<strong> nose</strong> while sneezing.		
刑		punish	Two hands . . . saber.		6	734	679	23	ケイ		This kanji is for <em>severe</em><strong> punish</strong>ment. A man has his shackled <em>hands</em> placed on a wood block and they're chopped off with a <em>saber</em>. No more stealing bread in the Middle East…	In Arab countries they<strong> punish</strong> theives by cutting off BOTH HANDS with a SABRE.	I'm gonna use my two hands and my saber to<strong> punish</strong> you naughty girls!	"The ancient <strong>punish</strong>ment for theft was to have the thief's <em>two hands</em> chopped off by a red-hot <em>sabre</em>. To distinguish from <a href=""../v4/833.html"">penalty</a> (#833 罰), think in terms of 'to<strong> punish</strong>', the actual -application- of the<strong> punish</strong>ment, which only comes after deciding what the penalty shall be."	This is Saber from Fate/Stay Night holding her Excalibur with both hands dealing Divine<strong> Punish</strong>ment to the evil Servants!		
型		mould	<i>Punish</i> . . . <i>soil</i>. In cases like this, you might find it easier to break the character up into its more basic elements, like this: <i>two hands</i> . . . <i>saber</i> . . . <i>soil</i>.		9	735	680	23	ケイ	かた、-がた	A famous ninja once pressed his <em>two hands</em> and <em>saber</em> into the <em>soil</em> of his temple, before going onto a mission from which he never came back. Think of some sort of signature that he left behind him. The<strong> mould</strong> of his two hands and saber has since become a popular attraction in the area.	As a PUNISHMENT they made me lay face down in the DIRT leaving a nice imprinted<strong> MOULD</strong> of my whole BODY.	Did you know there's a street in Japan like Hollywood Blvd. where famous ninjas press their <em>hands</em> and <em>sword</em> (which are famously deadly) into the <em>sidewalk(soil)</em> to form a<strong> mould</strong>?	When you are<strong> mould</strong>ing clay, you are in fact <em>punishing</em> the <em>ground</em> by folding, pressing, and hardening the<strong> mould</strong>.	On the fifth day God did <em>punish</em> the <em>soil</em> by <strong>molding</strong> it into man.		
才		genius	"Whatever one is particularly adept at - one's special ""<b>genius</b>"" - one can do very easily, ""with one finger"" as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for <i>fingers</i> backwards."	* The primitive meaning, <i>genie</i>, derives from the roots of the word <i>genius</i>. Use the <i>genie</i> out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered, and the meaning becomes a <i>genie in the bottle</i>.	3	736	681	23	サイ		"Spinal tap: ""Every other band's amps go to <em>ten</em>. But you see my <em>extra stroke</em> of<strong> genius</strong> - these go to eleven.""."	"A TEN year old had a STROKE of<strong> GENIUS</strong> and wrote this joke: <a href=""midori://search?text=%E4%BD%95%E6%AD%B3%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B%EF%BC%9F"">何歳ですか？</a> <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%82%E3%80%82%E3%80%82%E5%A4%A9%E6%89%8D%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%EF%BC%81"">。。。天才です！</a> ."	Ten is ten, but add a stroke of<strong> genius</strong> and…	Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!<strong> Genius</strong>!	"I use Azumanga Daioh's Mihama Chiyo-chan for this. Not only is this character ""genius"", but it is also the simplified ""years old"" counter, one which children use instead of 歳 . I can imagine Chiyo-chan saying: <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%8C%E5%8D%81%E6%89%8D%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%82%88%E3%80%8D"">「十才ですよ」</a> ""I'm ten years old.""

財		property	Clam . . . genie.		10	737	682	23	ザイ、サイ、ゾク	たから	If you're a <em>money genius</em>, you can afford a lot of<strong> property</strong>.	The keyword refers to<strong> property</strong> in the sense of money or funds rather than of buildings or real estate. Keep this one distinct from frame 193 (“wealth”) and frame 473 (“assets”). Here we have a genie, gulping down oysters. Someone tries to grab an oyster and the genie puts his big arms around his oysters and states his “right of ownership” : “They're mines, my<strong> property</strong>!”.	<strong>Property</strong> comes in several forms, shells (money) and intellectual<strong> property</strong> (genius).	A genius with money LEFT over buys<strong> property</strong>.	To gain a lot of<strong> property</strong>, you need either a <em>genie</em> or to be a <em>genius</em>. The <em>clam</em> is there to emphasize that this character is more about financial<strong> property</strong> or funds than real estate.		
材		lumber	Tree . . . genie.		7	738	683	23	ザイ		A TREE GENIUS is a<strong> LUMBER</strong> jack. Duh.	Just when the were about to turn the last tree into<strong> lumber</strong>, the Lorax (the <em>tree-genie</em>) jumps out and puts a stop to the whole affair.	The <em>genie</em> turns the<strong> lumber</strong> back into a <em>tree</em>.	"Here we have a <em>wood-genie</em> or <em>tree-genie</em>, dancing and singing the popular song from the Monthy Pythons : “I'm a<strong> lumber</strong>jack and I'm O - K, I sleep all night and I work all - day” … “I cut down trees, I eat my lunch, …”, etc. – ""the <em>tree-genie</em> is a<strong> lumber</strong>kack (and he's O K)""."	This can be remembered as a pictograph = 2 trees, one of which, has had a branch cut off to make<strong> lumber</strong>.		
存		suppose	"<i>Genie in the bottle</i> . . . <i>a child</i>. Hint: focus on the key word's connotation of ""make believe""."		6	739	684	23	ソン、ゾン		How do you<strong> suppose</strong> they manage to cram a genie inside a bottle? Well, I<strong> suppose</strong> they put him in there while he's still a little <em>child</em>…	Villagers on a little remote island one day find a bottle washed out by the sea onto the beach. After wiping the bottle and taking a closer look, they are amazed to see a (very small) <em>child</em> in it. The villagers<strong> suppose</strong> that the <em>child</em> is a <em>genie in a bottle</em>.	<strong>Suppose</strong> a <em>genie in a bottle</em> granted a child 3 wishes, that'd be great eh?	Only <em>children</em> <strong>suppose</strong> <em>genies</em> are for real.	A <em>genie in a bottle</em> is<strong> suppose</strong>d to grant you three wishes (one for each stroke of the <em>genie</em> primitive). Every <em>child</em> knows ( ご存じ ) that.		
在		exist	Genie in the bottle . . . soil.		6	740	685	23	ザイ	あ.る	Genie in the bottle does<strong> exist</strong> but you need to dig deep into the soil to find one.	You wipe the <em>soil</em> from the bottle, only to have a genie float out above you, saying: 'I am the <em>genie in a bottle</em>, what is your wish?' So now you know that they do<strong> exist</strong>.	"Genies don't<strong> exist</strong>! If you open the <em>""genie in a bottle""</em> you'll find nothing but <em>soil</em>."	"Only one extra stroke separates this from <a href=""../v4/152.html"">pressure</a> (#152 圧). // If <em>genies</em> do<strong> EXIST</strong> in bottles, they must certainly be crammed in them under extreme pressure ( 圧 ). If you really want to make sure that they do<strong> exist</strong>, be sure to clean the <em>dirt</em> off the lamp and give it an 'extra stroke' to find out!"	When Aladin discovered the <em>magic bottle</em>, he rubbed it and nothing happened. He then concluded that genies did not<strong> exist</strong>. However, upon arriving home, he saw that the spout was filled with <em>soil</em>. After cleaning the bottle the genie emerged and disperesed the skeptical Aladin's doubts.		
乃		from	"This pictograph of a clenched fist is another of the ""hand primitives."" Take note of its rather peculiar drawing. Try to think of drawing a <i>fist</i> (the primitive meaning) ""<b>from</b>"" this character to give yourself a connotation for the otherwise abstract key word."	* The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a <i>fist</i>.	2	741	686	23	ナイ、ダイ、ノ、アイ	の、すなわ.ち、なんじ	<strong>FROM</strong> a pictograph of a thumbs up. That's how it also gets the primitive meaning of fist.	Pictograph, see book. This kanji, as a chinese character, is in fact the origin for the hiragana possessive particle “no”. Try drawing this kanji fast, in a single stroke and you will end up with の .	"Think Charlton Heston: ""<strong>From</strong> my cold, dead fists"". Speech given to the National Boxing Association, in response to stricter control on boxing gloves."	Imagine fists punching at you<strong> from</strong> all angles.	<strong>FROM</strong>s up!		
携		portable	Fingers . . . turkey . . . fist.		13	742	687	23	ケイ	たずさ.える、たずさ.わる	"This character is the ""kei"" in ""keitai"" (cell phone), a word you will no doubt hear often in Japan, since everyone has one. Imagine you've just arrived in Japan, but don't have a cell phone yet, so instead you're carrying around a<strong> portable</strong> turkey you can hold in your fist. To dial a number, just poke it with your fingers."	Because they have no <em>fingers</em>, <em>turkeys</em> must use their <em>fists</em> when dialing on a<strong> portable</strong> phone.	"This character is the ""kei"" in ""keitai"" (cell phone), a word you will no doubt hear often in Japan, since everyone has one. I use my keitai with my FINGERS, like everyone, but if some TURKEY try to steal it, I don't hesitate to use my FIST ."	Some TURKEY has been sitting in the<strong> PORTABLE</strong> toilet forever. I pound my FIST on the door. Finally he comes out and gives me the FINGER.	What do you do with your <strong>portable</strong> keitai? Play ANGRY BIRDS, of course! You use you <strong>fingers</strong> to drag the birds across the screen. How do you know these birds are angry? Just picture a <strong>turkey</strong> scowling and shaking his <strong>fist</strong> at you.		
及		reach out	The addition of a final stroke transforms this character from the primitive for a clenched <i>fist</i> into the kanji for <b>reaching out</b>, much as a stroke of kindness can often turn anger into acceptance.	* As a primitive, this shall stand for <i>outstretched hands</i>. Only take care not to confuse it with that for <i>beg</i> (Frame 501)	3	743	688	23	キュウ	およ.ぶ、およ.び、および、およ.ぼす	I like to think of this as a <em>fist</em> with with brass knuckles because of the extra line. An old school thug <strong>reaches out</strong> to help you up but then with his other hand ( with the brass knuckles) punches you.	<strong>Reach out</strong> and fist someone (Do you see the person primitive?).	I like to think of the MATRIX. Now hear me out… Remember the scene when Neo and Mr. Smith fought in the subway? there was this one part where Mr. Smith threw his <em>FIST</em> at Neo, but Neo stopped it. Mr. Smith <strong>reached out</strong> his finger (the line coming from fist) and hit Neo in the throat.	This is an image of the fist getting an arm (the new stroke). The FIST now <strong>reaches out</strong> farther than before.	Dhalism (Street Figher) can<strong> reach out</strong> his <em>fist</em> an <em>extra stroke</em> farther than anyone else, even if their <em>hands are outstretched.</em>.		
吸		suck	<i>Mouth</i> . . . <i>outstretched hands</i>. Hint: use the image of a nursing baby.		6	744	689	23	キュウ	す.う	An <em>open mouth</em> and <em>reaching hands</em> : a baby wants to<strong> suck</strong> at his mother's breast.	Imagine a baby reaching out and holding mom's breast as if it were bottle, and<strong> suck</strong>ing on it to get some milk.	"It's a terrible image, but I see a baby <em>reaching out</em> to her mother's breasts, wanting to<strong> suck</strong>le some milk with her <em>mouth</em>. Meanwhile, her mother is<strong> suck</strong>ing back on a cig with total disregard to her child's health. / Thanks Proxx: This is also the kanji for すう ( 吸う ), used for ""to smoke [a cigarette]""."	Reach out and<strong> suck</strong> someone.	"To<strong> suck</strong>: open your <em>mouth</em> and <em>reach out</em> for you-know-what… (see also <a href=""../v4/690.html"">handle</a> (#690 扱))."		
扱		handle	Finger . . . outstretched hands.		6	745	690	23	ソウ、キュウ	あつか.い、あつか.う、あつか.る、こ.く	"See <a href=""../v4/689.html"">suck</a> (#689 吸): if it's too big to<strong> handle</strong>, just use your <em>fingers</em> instead…"	One of the first thing a baby can do with his hand is to <em>reach out</em> and grab your <em>finger</em> as if it was a little<strong> handle</strong>.	<strong>Handle</strong> with care… carefully hold the Nitroglycerin within your fingers with outstretched hands for fear of it blowing up in your face…	A toddler reaching up with OUTSTRETCHED HANDS for a mug sitting on the table, just barely out of his reach. Straining, he can just barely get his FINGER to brush the<strong> handle</strong>.	"Pay attention to this story because you'll learn how to recall the reading of this kanji as well: We've all heard the expression: ""Too hot to<strong> handle</strong>"" – Well, just imagine you are <em>reaching out</em> your <em>fingers</em> to touch someone's face and it is too hot to<strong> handle</strong>. (Then you can combine the word for hot (atsui) with the word for face (kao) and always remember how this character is read: atsukau - あつかう.)."		
丈		length	The <b>length</b> whose measure this kanji depicts extends from the tip of one hand to the tip of the other with <i>arms</i> at full length. Notice the final stroke, which cuts across the vertical second stroke to distinguish it from <i>large</i> (Frame 112).		3	746	691	23	ジョウ	たけ、だけ	Both a meter and a yard are about one arm-length.	"When girls ask about my<strong> length</strong>, I hold out my <em>one arm</em>, and tell them ""you get the idea""."	"This kanji reminds me of the kanji for big (I think it looks the same kinda of except for the last stroke). Maybe this works for guys, but when you were growing up you would compare ""length"" with your friends trying to show how BIG you were. You wouldn't show ""it"" but you would spread your arms out as wide as possible to exaggerate your<strong> length</strong>. Maybe even so wide that you trip (I the 3rd stroke getting pushed over)! I just find it easier to relate this to the previous kanji."	This kanji demonstrates the proper technique for throwing a bowling ball the<strong> LENGTH</strong> of the alley. Stroke 1- lift the ball up horizontally to judge the throw Stroke 2 - gently swing the arm back Stroke 3 - whip your arm forward and roll the ball off the tips of your fingers Strike!	ONE ARM<strong> LENGTH</strong>.		
史		history	A mouth . . . tucked under the arm.		5	747	692	23	シ		I sleep in<strong> history</strong> class with my <em>mouth tucked under my arm</em>.	"<strong>History</strong> students usually going to school with a<strong> history</strong> book tucked under their arm. But now instead of a book, you have a small talking mouth that tell you about<strong> history</strong>. ""When I was young, I used to walk 5 miles everyday…..""."	<strong>History</strong> is told by one mouth; the winner's. The loser's opinion is not told and is tucked under the arm (silenced ) by the winner.	You've got your Hogwarts Magic<strong> History</strong> book in time for the semester, but with its ferociously snapping <em>mouth</em>, you can't just <em>tuck it under the arm</em> and carry it to class.	Someone with big arms goes to a museum and picks up an historian at the entrance, <em>tucks it under his arm</em>, and proceeds with the visit. The historian is like a <em>mouth</em> <em>tucked under the arm</em>, telling the big man all he needs to know about<strong> history</strong>.		
吏		officer	One . . . mouth . . . tucked under the arm.		6	748	693	23	リ		<em>One</em><strong> officer</strong> can change the course of <em>history</em>.	<em>One</em><strong> officer</strong>, namely Napoleon, changed the course of <em>history</em>. (Thanks, ayoung24). Napoleon is also my primitive meaning.	In a police state, the police<strong> officer</strong>s all speak with <em>one mouth</em> and have a gun tucked <em>under their arm</em>.	"This is not <a href=""../v4/1095.html"">military officer</a> (#1095 尉), but more of a government<strong> officer</strong>, official or bureaucrat, such as Barack Obama, who started out as a lowly government<strong> officer</strong> (communitee organizer) and the broke through the glass <em>ceiling</em> to become president of the United States and make <em>history</em> (I know a glass ceiling generally refers to an obstacle for women, but I wanted to avoid key words such as <a href=""../v4/98.html"">woman</a> (#98 女), <a href=""../v4/1151.html"">lady</a> (#1151 婦) or <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/563"">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌))."	I used HISTORY as a primitive rather than separating it into 'mouth' and 'tucked under the arm'. Think about the Japanese history textbook controversy. The government<strong> OFFICER</strong>S choosing the textbooks are the ONE elite group determining Japan's HISTORY.		
更		grow late	The implication behind the meaning of <b>grow late</b> is that things are changing in the same way that the day turns into night. The elements: <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>sun</i> . . . <i>tucked under the arm</i>.		7	749	694	23	コウ	さら、さら.に、ふ.ける、ふ.かす	It's starting to<strong> GROW LATE</strong>, so God will take the SUN, and TUCK IT UNDER HIS ARM, and walk away. In the morning, he'll bring it back, so don't worry.	"At <a href=""../v4/30.html"">nightbreak</a> (#30 旦) the sun rises above the floor, so it is logical that when it is growing late, the sun would rise to the ceiling. Time to pack up your things and take your belongings under your arm."	I keep <em>one sun tucked under my arm</em> for light when it grows late.	As it begins to<strong> grow late</strong> the <em>sun</em> projects the shadow of my <em>arm</em> on the <em>ceiling</em>.	When it is <strong>growing late</strong>, the <em>sun</em> sinks below the <em>floor</em>. Time to tuck your belongings <em>under your arm</em> and head home. 更ける (ふける) : get late, advance, wear on; 更に (さらに) : furthermore, again, after all, more and more, moreover; 変更 (へんこう) : change, modification, alteration; 夜更け (よふけ) : late at night.		
硬		stiff	Rocks . . . grow late.		12	750	695	23	コウ	かた.い	A<strong> stiff</strong> drink on the <em>ROCK</em>s after it <em>GROWS LATE</em> is a way to unwind after a long day…	<em>Stones</em> are so<strong> stiff</strong> that even if you spent all day straining trying to change their shape, it would <em>grow late</em> far before you ever accomplished your task.	There's a city whose inhabitants <strong>stiff</strong>en and turn to <em>stone</em> every night when it <em>grows late</em>.	My girlfriend started playing with my <em>stones</em> when it was <em>growing late</em>, and I got a<strong> stiff</strong>y.	The trolls took so much time discussing how to cook their meal that it <em>grew late</em>: they all became<strong> stiff</strong> and turned to <em>stone</em>.		
梗		spiny	This character refers originally to a deciduous, rough tree that grows on mountain plains. From this it gets the secondary sense of rugged or <b>spiny</b>. Its primitive elements: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>grow late</i>.		11	751	2498	23	コウ、キョウ	ふさぐ、やまにれ、おおむね	I learned this one from the movie Evil Dead, but when it <em>grows late</em>, <em>trees</em> change shape and become<strong> spiny</strong> creatures! Lesson: don't go out at night.	As it grows late, Lakitu retires for the evening, leaving the<strong> spiny</strong>s to fend for themselves against Mario. Picture them jumping out of trees instead of being hurled from Lakitu. Lakitu - is the guy who flys the cloud in the Mario games…	Usually the <em>tree</em> you bump into when it <em>grows late</em> happens to be<strong> spiny</strong>.	"梗概 , 梗塞 , 心筋梗塞 , 桔梗 , <a href=""../v4/2498.html"">spiny</a> (#2498 梗) コウ, キョウ … Parts: 木 , 更 <a href=""../v4/694.html"">grow late</a> (#694 更) … Story: Since this is used for infarction ( 梗塞 ), and myocardial infarction ( 心筋梗塞 ), the<strong> Spiny</strong> should tie into that. So when it <em>Grows Late</em> , and the old guy gets <em>Wood</em>, he has a <strong>myocardial infarction</strong> that feels like a<strong> Spiny</strong> monster grabbing his heart."	INFARCTION (new keyword, according to real meaning). If it GROWS LATE and you get an INFARCTION, have someone call an ambulance. In the meantime try to relax, stay under a TREE.		
又		or again	"Like the several abbreviations in Roman script to indicate ""and"" (+, &, etc.), this short two-stroke kanji is used for the similar meaning of <b>or again</b>."	* As a primitive, it will mean <i>crotch</i>, as in the <i>crotch</i> of the arm. Or whatever.	2	752	696	23	ユウ	また、また-、また.の-	"This keyword should really be ""again"" not ""or again"" Here is some context: think of the phrase ""Jya mata"" "" じゃ又 "" which is a farewell similar to ""then again"". Also ""Mata ne"" "" 又ね "" and mata ashita (again tomorrow) "" 又明日 ""。 Note this kanji is rarely used, most of the time JP people spell it out ""mata"" except for in the last example: 又明日 ."	"After her boyfriend's <em>crotch</em> has been satisfied, a woman might suggest they cuddle. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might say, ""<strong>Or again</strong>, we could fool around . . . ""."	"The crotch is the area of vital ""<strong>or again</strong>s"". (Organs, that is.)."	"As a primitive, instead of using ""crotch"", I also often use ""sat cross-legged"" as this also looks like the kanji."	"I agree with bodhisamaya and sindhikara, this kanji is more like just ""again"". You can change this kanji to ""again"" if you change [ again FRAME 1815 ] to Re- , which is it's real meaning anyways. Also, beware of too many penis euphemisms. Associating crotch with penis is not too bad, but if you associate column, meat, gigantic, etc. with penises, you might find yourself confused as to which euphemism you meant."		
双		pair	The <i>crotch</i> reduplicated gives us a <b>pair</b>.		4	753	697	23	ソウ	ふた、たぐい、ならぶ、ふたつ	The animals boarding Noah's Ark all came in<strong> pair</strong>s – but Noah had to carefully check the two crotches in each<strong> pair</strong> to ensure that the animals were of different sexes and thus able to further their species after the flood.	<em>Crotch to crotch</em> is how many <strong>pairs</strong> spend their private time together. . .	Instead of bringing home 1 girl and enjoying her CROTCH, it's better to bring home a<strong> PAIR</strong> of girls and enjoy 2 CROTCHES!! I've done this several times so I'll remember this kanji easily.	The left <em>crotch</em> looks more like the man's and the right a woman's, the ultimate<strong> pair</strong>.	Hey buddy, grow a<strong> pair</strong>! (two testies) Oops, one is kind of misshaped. :0.		
桑		mulberry	"<i>Crotches</i>, <i>crotches</i> everywhere . . . <i>tree</i>. Hint: think of a group of children playing an original version of ""Here We Go 'Round the <b>Mulberry</b> Bush."""		10	754	698	23	ソウ	くわ	"Children going around the<strong> mulberry</strong> <em>tree</em> singing ""This is the way we wash our <em>crotch</em>, wash our <em>crotch</em>, wash our <em>crotch</em>…""."	Imagine kids <em>all over</em> the top of a<strong> mulberry</strong> <em>tree</em>, sitting astride limbs so that their weight is on their <em>crotches</em>. (Mulberry trees have big sprawling limbs that run horizontally or at shallow angles making them easy to climb and sit in. I have an old<strong> mulberry</strong> in my yard, and my kids are in it constantly).	"According to Wikipedia, ""unripe [MULBERRY] fruit and green parts of the plant have a white sap that is intoxicating and mildly hallucinogenic."" When looking at the<strong> MULBERRY</strong> <em>tree</em>, some have hallucinated that they are seeing <em>crotches, crotches everywhere</em>!"	Mulberries taste like crotch. This is a pictograph of the crotchberry tree. Look at all the ripe berries up top!	Do you see the three students <em>sitting cross-legged</em> on the <em>tree</em> eating<strong> mulberry</strong>?		
隻		vessels	The key word indicates the Japanese generic term for counting ships. Its elements: <i>turkey</i> . . . <i>crotch</i>.		10	755	699	23	セキ		On<strong> Vessels</strong> that travel long distances, sailors often get quite lonely. They keep TURKEYS on the<strong> VESSELS</strong>, but not for use as food. The lonely sailors take turns enjoying the turkey's CROTCH.	Donald Duck is a <em>big bird</em> that does <em>not wear pants</em>. It's good to use him as a mnemonic because he is a sailor, and this kanji is used to count<strong> vessels</strong>.	The turky's crotch is a vessel for the stuffing that you fill it with.	The USS Turkeycrotch is a seaworthy vessel.	An ole' pirate <em>turkey</em> sits <em>astride</em> the prow of a vessel (i.e. with his <em>crotch</em> on the prow). Recall from PAGE 211 the old turkey with pipe and monocle : now he takes off his monocle and uses a “field-glass” to count other<strong> vessels</strong> (pirate ships) on the horizon (this kanji is also a counter for ships).		
護		safeguard	Words . . . flowers . . . vessels.		20	756	700	23	ゴ	まも.る	"Think of the <em>flower-vessels</em> as a the Greenpeace vessel “Arctic Sunrise”, only instead of a rainbow there is a big <em>flower</em> painted on the hull (this will come back in <a href=""../v4/701.html"">seize</a> (#701 獲) and <a href=""../v4/908.html"">harvest</a> (#908 穫)). Think of “flower-power” and of the “peace” in “Greenpeace” and it will make some sense hopefully. – In this kanji, we see an inauguration <em>speech</em> being given before the Greenpeace vessel is set afloat and sent to<strong> safeguard</strong> our planet."	<em>Words</em> and <em>Flowers</em> are exchanged between sailors and their wives before they board the <em>vessel</em> to<strong> safeguard</strong> the world.	(With sarcasm) A Bush speech telling how all the US <em>vessels</em> are always welcomed, covered with <em>flowers</em> and <em>word</em>s of gratitude for<strong> safeguard</strong>ing democracy from the evil doers.	The <em>flower vessel</em> is of course the <em>Mayflower</em> in which the pilgrims came to America in their search for turkeys. During they trip, they prayed non-stop - using <em>words</em> as spells to<strong> safeguard</strong> Mayflower from danger.	Thanks to fuaburisu with modification Think of the <em>flower-vessels</em> as a ship full of hippies garlanded with flowers – In this kanji, we see that the hippies carry no weapons on the ship to<strong> safeguard</strong> against pirates. No, because of their nonviolence pact they have decided they will fend off pirates only with their words.		
獲		seize	A pack of <i>wild dogs</i> . . . <i>flowers</i> . . . <i>vessels</i>.

Customs just<strong> seize</strong>d a crate of poppies (<em>flowers</em>) detected by trained <em>wild dogs</em> who inspected the <em>vessel</em>.	A group of <strong>police dogs</strong> are used to sniff out some opium <strong>flowers</strong> on a cargo <strong>vessel</strong>. The drugs are then <strong>seized</strong> by the authorities.	Pirates, the <em>wild dogs</em> of the seas (<strong>seize</strong>), capture a <em>vessel</em> loaded with poppy <em>flowers</em>. (The poppies were intended for medicinal use, but the pirates have other ideas). 獲物 (えもの) : game, spoils, trophy 捕獲 (ほかく) : capture, seizure.	Wild dogs<strong> SEIZE</strong> the (may)flower vessel! Those meanies.		
奴		guy	Woman . . . crotch.		5	758	702	23	ド	やつ、やっこ	"That<strong> GUY</strong> stole my WOMAN so I kicked him in the CROTCH. (This story helps keep the word ""GUY"" as someone you hold in contempt)."	<strong>Guy</strong>s only care about 2 things: <em>women</em> and their <em>crotch</em> (preferably at the same time).	All I need is a <em>woman</em> next to my <em>crotch</em>. What can I say, I'm a<strong> GUY</strong>.	<strong>GUY</strong>S (derogatory) are always thinking about women's crotches. 1) 此奴 【こいつ】this<strong> guy</strong>. 2) 其奴 【そいつ】that<strong> guy</strong>. 3) 彼奴 【あいつ】that<strong> guy</strong>.	On the streets of Bangkok you see what looks like a <em>woman</em>, but a glance at the <em>crotch</em> reveals it's a<strong> guy</strong>.		
怒		angry	Guy . . . heart.		9	759	703	23	ド、ヌ	いか.る、おこ.る	This <em>woman</em> is<strong> angry</strong> because of the guys in the previous frame who pay more attention to her <em>crotch</em> than her <em>heart</em>. I prefer to decompose the kanji in three elements here because it is easier to read like a mnemonic.	WOMEN get very<strong> ANGRY</strong> over the thought that GUYS are more interested in her CROTCH than her HEART.	When a <em>guy</em> steps on her <em>heart</em>, a woman can get quite<strong> angry</strong>.	Guys are<strong> angry</strong> at heart.	You want<strong> angry</strong>? Here's<strong> angry</strong>: just tell a <strong>woman</strong> that you value her <strong>crotch</strong> over her <strong>heart</strong>. I don't wanna be 1) you or 2) around when that happens, dude.		
友		friend	By one's side . . . crotch.		4	760	704	23	ユウ	とも	A good<strong> friend</strong> is always at your side. —- I teach at a Japanese High School, and I often see chummy male students grabbing each other's crotches in a joking manner. It's still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor's crotch is a great way to express<strong> friend</strong>ship.	Think of a sex<strong> friend</strong> (a fuck buddy if you will). The benefit of such a relationship is that there will always be a <em>crotch by your side</em>. (the Japanese refer to such a<strong> friend</strong> as セフレ, just as we do).	<strong>Friend</strong>s with benefits anyone?	A<strong> friend</strong> is always on your side - again and again and again.	Your best<strong> friend</strong> is your crotch. Its always by your side and never lets you down.		
抜		slip out	Fingers . . . friend.		7	761	705	23	バツ、ハツ、ハイ	ぬ.く、-ぬ.く、ぬ.き、ぬ.ける、ぬ.かす、ぬ.かる	Don't let good <em>friends</em><strong> slip out</strong> between your <em>fingers</em>.	Imagine a cliché Hollywood situation: one person is lying on the edge of the abyss and another (presumably his <em>friend</em>) is hanging, only thing holding him is the grip of their hands. Then <em>fingers</em> <strong>slip out</strong> of the grip and he falls in said abyss.	The only stories I can think of here are really aggressively pornographic, so maybe I should just say nothing.	"""I want to <em>finger</em> my <em>friend</em>!"" The words just <strong>slipped out</strong>. That's the last time I play truth or dare while drunk."	My <em>finger</em>s <strong>slipped out</strong> of my <em>friend</em> and I knew we were past the friend's stage at that moment.		
投		throw	Fingers . . . missile.		7	762	706	23	トウ	な.げる、-な.げ	Well, you usually use your <em>fingers</em> to<strong> throw</strong> objects used as <em>missile</em> weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the <em>missile</em> primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it's a <em>crotch</em> (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the <em>wind</em>. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers…	"<strong>If you use the primitive ""semen"" (flying in the wind from your crotch) instead of missile then all kanjis with this primitive will hilariously create a perfect story</strong>."	RPG. A wizard <strong>throws</strong> magic <em>missiles</em> from the tip of his <em>fingers</em>.	He's a great pitcher. He can<strong> throw</strong> a split <em>finger</em> fastball that's like a <em>missile.</em>.	In Japan, where gun-control laws are strict, the desperate criminals have resorted to<strong> throw</strong>ing chopped-off <em>finger missiles</em> at each other.

"The submarine's hull was breached after being struck by a torpedo (""<em>water missile</em>""), causing the entire crew to<strong> drown</strong>."	I made her<strong> drown</strong> in my in my <em>semen</em>, which was coming down on her like buckets of <em>water</em>. (applying crystal's perfect primitive element).	"I give this Kanji the keyword <strong>go down</strong> (in the sense of something plummeting or going down badly, not in the sense of descending, which is already used) because it is used in sinking ( 沈没 ), dying ( 戦没 ), and sunset ( 日没 ). It seems to me 溺 is the character for<strong> drown</strong>, and in fact it is given the keyword ""drowning"" later, which is just confusing to me. Story: The ship is <strong>going down</strong>! We were hit by a <em>water</em> <em>missile</em> (a torpedo)."	When a torpedo (<em>water missile</em>) hits its target, everyone<strong> drown</strong>s!		
股		thigh	Flesh . . . missile.		8	764	2454	23	コ	また、もも	Where's my <em>flesh missile</em>? Between my <strong>thighs</strong>, naturally…	My<strong> thigh</strong> is the part of the body that my missile smacks against.	This also means <strong>crotch</strong>, and is on the 2010 常用漢字 list. So to_nihon's story is very apt.	To smuggle arms across the border, I have heard of amputees who replace the <em>flesh</em> of their<strong> thigh</strong> with a <em>missle</em>! If you paint it right…	Chun Li's thunder <strong>thighs</strong> – the <em>part of her body</em> that lets her kick with the force and speed of a <em>missile</em>.		
設		establishment	Words . . . missile.		11	765	708	23	セツ	もう.ける	<strong>Establishment</strong> can be attacked by words or by missiles. Writers will use words, whereas militars will use missiles.	When you attack the<strong> establishment</strong> with <em>words</em>, it fights back with <em>missiles</em>.

Vehicle to transport troops 2. Once troops have disembarked they have their missiles 3. If they run out of missiles they resort to hand to hand combat to<strong> beat</strong> the enemy.	In a random version of rock,paper, scissors. A car is<strong> beat</strong>en by a missile that hits it, the missile is<strong> beat</strong>en by the hand that can type in the deactivation code (which in turn is<strong> beat</strong>en by the car that runs over it).	Dirty little young driver in his <strong>car</strong>, <strong>semen</strong> flies up in the air and hits his <strong>hand</strong> as he <strong>beats</strong> it.	I have three strategies to<strong> beat</strong> this guy. First I try to run him over with my car. If that fails I through missles at him. Finally, if that also doesn't work I simply use my hands to<strong> beat</strong> him up.		
殻		husk	Samurai . . . superfluous . . . missile.		11	767	710	23	カク、コク、バイ	から、がら	Samurai's<strong> husk</strong>/shell/armour is superflous to missile attacks 甲殻 卵殻 貝殻 .	<strong>husk</strong> or <strong>shell</strong>. Japan's recent history in a nut<strong>shell</strong>: first the <em>samurai</em> became<em> superfluous </em>and then the Americans started to <em>throw missiles </em> and bombs during WWII.	"The primitives tie so nicely into a story: upon the use of <em>missiles</em> in warfare, the traditional role of <em>samurai</em> became <em>superfluous</em> in battle. How to tie it to the keyword of ""husk""? Easy! Afterwards, the samurai were demoted (like potato-peeling privates), and they sat around<strong> HUSK</strong>ING corn and cracking eggs and peanut shells (kanji refers to both 'husk' and 'shell'). A strong image to lock in the kanji: imagine samurai using their mighty swords to de-husk corn and split peanuts! Also see <a href=""../v4/917.html"">cereals</a> (#917 穀)."	The samurai, now superfluous since the advent of the missile, was but a<strong> husk</strong> of a man. (Sumarai/Superfluous):Missile =<strong> Husk</strong>.	A samurai<strong> husk</strong>ing corn, which means removing the part that is superfluous, so that he can use the corn as missiles in some upcoming war………		
支		branch	Needle . . . crotch.		4	768	711	23	シ	ささ.える、つか.える、か.う、しんよう、じゅうまた	Picture sliding down the<strong> branch</strong> of a tree (in this case a pine tree or any tree with <em>needles</em>) and getting a bunch of <em>needles</em> stuck in your <em>crotch</em>–ouch!!	A special<strong> branch</strong> of the military called the <em>Needle Crotch</em> Unit. Their only weapon is the <em>needle</em> embedded in their <em>crotches</em>, and they're quite adept at using them.	"Sitting on the<strong> BRANCH</strong> of a coniferous tree, getting sharp <em>needles</em> in my <em>crotch</em>. (Remember there is no tree radical in this kanji, whereas <a href=""../v4/713.html"">bough</a> (#713 枝) ( 枝 ) does because a ""bough"" is a main part of the tree, whereas this kanji refers to a smaller<strong> branch</strong>. It can also be used to refer to the<strong> branch</strong> of a store ( 支店 ) which also has nothing to do with a tree)."	I have a 10 inch<strong> branch</strong> coming out of my crotch.	I would try to steer away from using tree imagery for this kanji: 支 (branch) is not actually used for tree<strong> branch</strong>es, but rather for conceptual<strong> branch</strong>es, like a store<strong> branch</strong> ( 支店 ). 枝 (bough), on the other hand, is an actual <em>branch</em> from a <em>tree</em>.		
技		skill	Fingers . . . branch.		7	769	712	23	ギ	わざ	(Adapted from darg_sama's) Balancing a <em>branch</em> on your <em>finger</em> is the prototypical example of a<strong> skill</strong> that is nothing more than a<strong> skill</strong> (i.e., it is completely useless).	I think of a guy balancing a branch on his finger, which definitely takes some minimal amount of<strong> skill</strong>.	Better be <strong>skilled</strong> with your <em>finger</em> if all you've got is a <em>needle</em> <em>crotch</em>.	Forget balancing branches and stupid shit like that. It takes real<strong> skill</strong> to <em>finger</em> <em>ten</em> <em>crotches</em> at the same time. For real, nobody was ever a hero for balancing branches.	Grasping a BRANCH with their FINGERS was the first<strong> SKILL</strong> that premodern humans learned.		
枝		bough	<i>Tree</i> . . . <i>branch</i>. Take a moment to focus on the differences between a <b>bough</b>, a <i>branch</i>, and a <i>twig</i> (Frame 319).		8	770	713	23	シ	えだ	The <em>tree's</em> primary <em>branch</em> is known as the<strong> bough</strong>.	"Differentiate between<strong> BOUGH</strong> and <a href=""../v4/711.html"">branch</a> (#711 支): 'branch' is smaller, and can also refer to the branch of a store ( 支店 ), which has nothing to do with a tree. But a<strong> BOUGH</strong> is a main part of a tree, perhaps where the trunk splits into several large<strong> bough</strong>s, and so it logically utilizes the 木 radical."	I think of a<strong> bough</strong> as a <em>branch</em> that's big enough to be a <em>tree</em> itself.	支 (branch) is not actually used for tree branches, but rather for conceptual branches, like a store branch, or a branch of mathematics. 枝 (bough), on the other hand, is an actual <em>branch</em> from a <em>tree</em>.	As James Heisig suggests, let's take a moment to focus on the differences between a<strong> bough</strong>, a branch, and a twig. A twig is “a small, leafless branch of a woody plant”. A<strong> bough</strong> is “a large or main <em>branch</em> of a <em>tree</em>” (a branch is somewhere in between the<strong> bough</strong>s and the twigs).		
肢		limb	Part of the body . . . branch.		8	771	714	23	シ		"The<strong> limb</strong>s that this kanji represents are <em>parts of the body</em> that are connected to the trunk, like the main <em>branches</em> to a tree (“arms and legs” is the second meaning of this kanji). In other words,<strong> limb</strong>s are ""<em>flesh branches</em>""."	<strong>Limb</strong>s are <em>body parts</em> that <em>branch</em> off.	"No Timmy, we don't say ""flesh branches"", we say ""limbs""."	<strong>Limb</strong>s are <em>flesh</em>y <em>branch</em>es.	<strong>Limb</strong> = <em>meat branch</em> (sometimes it's almost too easy).

PRIMITIVE: <em>soiled crotch</em> = <em>soiled underwear</em>. To precent anyone from picking the beautiful <em>flower</em>, the gardner hung <em>soiled underwear</em> on the <strong>stalk</strong>.	A <em>flower</em>'s<strong> stalk</strong> can be seen as connecting the <em>flower</em> to the <em>soil</em>, <em>or again</em> the <em>soil</em> to the <em>flower</em>. It depends on how you look at it.	Jack and the Bean<strong>stalk</strong>: <em>dirt</em> below, <em>flowers</em> above, and Jack's <em>crotch</em> visible as he climbs up and up. 茎 (くき) :<strong> stalk</strong>.	Flowering vines growing up a post or column. The<strong> stalk</strong>s wrap around the post– again and again– like a <em>spool </em>of thread, and <em>flowers</em> bloom at the very top. At the bottom, of course, is the soil.		
怪		suspicious	State of mind . . . spool.		8	773	716	23	カイ、ケ	あや.しい、あや.しむ	When you're<strong> suspicious</strong>, your state of mind twists round and round like a spool of thread.	Imagine a loud farting sound on The Enterprise (sorry). Everyone looks around trying to find who did it. The one looking most<strong> suspicious</strong> is <em>Data</em>. His <em>soiled crotch</em> gives him away.	"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reason: See my note at <a href=""../v4/715.html"">stalk</a> (#715 茎).

軽		lightly	Car . . . spool.		12	774	717	23	ケイ	かる.い、かろ.やか、かろ.んじる	Fact: this kanji is used to denote a certain class of vehicles in Japan whose engines are under a certain size (less than 750cc I think) and are called <strong>light</strong> vehicles here. Imagine a so-called <strong>light</strong> vehicle or a <strong>light</strong>-truck with a load of <em>spools</em> driving down a road ever so<strong> lightly</strong>, careful not to let any of the <em>spools</em> roll out onto the street.	I want to tread<strong> lightly</strong> on the environment…. That's why I CAR-SPOOL to work everyday…. I know, lame.	"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reason: See my note at <a href=""../v4/715.html"">stalk</a> (#715 茎).

This kanji becomes easy if you use its proper meaning as a keyword: <strong>younger sibling of parent</strong>. Now read the character as a set of instructions to locate the <strong>younger siblings of your parents</strong> in your family tree, starting from yourself: If you go up to the row (generation) <em>above</em>, to your parents, then the <strong>younger siblings of your parents</strong> are the <em>littler</em> ones as that sprang from the same <em>crotch</em>.	You don't want to know. Really.

Remember before he started to hang out with his nephews, he lived all alone in a huge <em>house</em>, old and broken because of the<strong> loneliness</strong>.	Aww. I mean, you kinda gotta feel sorry for creepy <em>Uncle Herbert the Pervert</em>. When he goes to his house, which is nothing more than a <em>floating roof</em>, nobody else is there. It's so <em>small</em> there's only room for him and his <em>crotch</em>. What an image of<strong> LONELINESS</strong>.	"This is the famous Japanese emotive word SABI. For a good image of SABI, here is a quote from the Haiku poet Basho (translated by Robert Haas): ""If a man goes to war wearing stout armor or to a party dressed up in gay clothes, and if this man happens to be an old man, there is something lonely about him. Sabi is something like that."" Now just put your old <em>uncle</em> in the picture and imagine the<strong> loneliness</strong> he feels in the <em>house.</em>."		
淑		graceful	Water . . . uncle.		11	778	721	23	シュク	しと.やか	<em>Uncle</em> (the one who is lonely and coaches kids in his spare time) is actually a<strong> graceful</strong> guy once he hits the <em>water</em>, as he used to be part of the swimming team in his youth.

"Imagine uncle Bruce teaching you how to be<strong> graceful</strong>: ""Be water my kid""."	This kanji also referrers to ladies. Such as virtuous,<strong> graceful</strong> ladies. 淑女 【しゅくじょ】 (n) lady; (P) STORY: When the lonely UNCLE sees some lovely LADIES in the WATER (pool), he starts to swim<strong> GRACEFUL</strong>LY as to impress them.		
反		anti-	Cliff . . . crotch.		4	779	722	23	ハン、ホン、タン、ホ	そ.る、そ.らす、かえ.す、かえ.る、-かえ.る	I think of an<strong> anti-</strong>hero (Dirty Harry etc.) for this primitive, whose trademark for disposing of villians is not an honorable fight, but a kick in the <em>crotch</em> and then a shove off a <em>cliff</em> (perhaps whilst the villain's back is turned).	Many cultures are so<strong> anti-</strong>sex you'd think they just want people to throw their <em>crotches</em> over a <em>cliff</em>.	Some people are using an<strong> ANTI-</strong>hero for this one, and it seems a good idea. The problem is… what<strong> ANTI-</strong>hero can you relate to <strong>crotch</strong>? Well, the answer is……………… . ハードゲイでえええええええええええええす！フォォォォォォォォォォォォォー！ (If you don't know Hard Gay, just look it up on Youtube. You'll remember this kanji, that's guaranteed.	A group of people protesting against something expose their crotches at the top of a cliff. They're shaking their naked posteriors up in the air, with the letters a-n-t-i- spelled on their buttocks, as a sign of protestation. * You can use the image of the “anti-” protesters shaking their naked posteriors up in the air for the primitive.	"Despite their stunning similarity, this is not a <a href=""../v4/704.html"">friend</a> (#704 友), but the opposite: An <strong>anti-friend</strong>! Instead of always being at your side he throws you off a <em>cliff</em>."		
坂		slope	Ground . . . anti-.		7	780	723	23	ハン	さか	As the villain (pushed off by the anti-hero) is tumbling down the<strong> slope</strong>, he activates gadget skis to escape, spraying soil everywhere as he flies down the<strong> slope</strong>.	This kanji depicts a classic enviornmental problem: erosion. Erosion occurs when all of the <em>soil</em> washes of the side of the <em>cliff</em>, eventually causing the <em>cliff</em> to disappear, leaving a<strong> slope</strong> (an <em>anti- cliff</em> if you will) in its place.	A<strong> slope</strong> is <em>anti</em>-flat <em>soil</em>.	<strong>Slope</strong> = ski<strong> slope</strong>. You're speeding down the ski<strong> slope</strong> with your <em>anti-</em>gravity skis. These special skis work not only on snow, they even work on raw <em>soil</em>, allowing you to hover above the <em>ground</em>.	Dirty Harry kicks the guy in the crotch. The poor guy rolling down the<strong> slope</strong> end up in a pile of earth.		
板		plank	Tree . . . anti-.		8	781	724	23	ハン、バン	いた	Of course, <em>trees</em> are <em>anti-</em>plank. Wouldn't you be if you were a <em>tree</em>?	Trees are naturally opposed to, or anti, the making of<strong> plank</strong>s.	Trees are definitely anti-plank. They're even having a protest. Ironically the signs are still made of paper.	Our <em>anti</em> hero Dirty Harry is having a pirate fantasy about pushing the villain from a <em>tree</em><strong> plank</strong>.	"A <strong>plank</strong> of wood is made from <em>trees</em>. Obviously <em>trees</em> are""<em>anti-</em><strong>plank</strong>"" since they are cut down and shaped to be made into <strong>planks</strong>. Now imagine a demonstration of anti-<strong>plank</strong> <em>trees</em> protesting against their massacre by grouping together and waving around their campaign slogans in the air on signs. And what are those signs made of out, people? Irony."		
返		return	Anti- . . . road.		7	782	725	23	ヘン	かえ.す、-かえ.す、かえ.る、-かえ.る	Pretty obvious: to<strong> return</strong> is to turn back on the road you're on and go the opposite way.	"<strong>Return</strong> here means ""return something"" rather than ""go back"". So here it goes, for those of you who are also suffering of the Japanese summer ;-) I ordered an <em>anti</em> mosquito kit, but it was damaged on the <em>way</em> so I had to<strong> return</strong> it."	"In ""The<strong> Return</strong> of the <em>anti-hero</em>"", Clint Eastwood kicks the villain in the crotch, pushes them off the cliff and onto a busy <em>highway</em>. A tiring movie franchise to say the least…."	If you're ANTI-ROAD then of course, you'll just<strong> return</strong> home.	I am not sure why, but I bought a road. Why did I do that? I hate roads. I'm anti road! I'd rather fly. I'd better see if I can<strong> return</strong> it.		
販		marketing	Shells/money . . . anti-.		11	783	726	23	ハン		The goal of<strong> marketing</strong> is to get people who are naturally anti-buying to spend their shells (money).	『MARKETING: MONEY, ANTI』 The wide presence of<strong> MARKETING</strong> in our society has led people to become ANTI-MONEY.	Dirty Harry (our anti-hero) refused the villainous<strong> marketing</strong> director's offer of money before he kicked him in the crotch and pushed him off the cliff.	<strong>Marketing</strong> is an anti-money of sorts. When it comes into contact with money, the money disappears.	<strong>Marketing</strong> tries to get consumers to be <em>anti-money</em> and pro-products.		
爪		claw	This character is a pictograph of a bird's <b>claw</b>, and from there comes to mean animal <b>claws</b> in general (including human fingernails).	* As a primitive, we shall use the graphic image of a <i>vulture</i>, a bird known for its powerful <i>claws</i>. It generally appears above another primitive, in which case it gets squeezed into the form ⺥.	4	784	727	23	ソウ	つめ、つま-	A pictograph of Wolverine's adamantium<strong> claw</strong>s.	Pictograph, see book. * I prefer the primitive meaning of an eagle rather than vulture. Somehow vulture makes me think more about meat and dead corpses than<strong> claw</strong>s. An eagle however immediately brings to my mind the image of an eagle plunging into a stream catching fish in his<strong> claw</strong>s, or that of the great eagles rescuing Bilbo and his party in Jrr Tolkien's novel “Bilbo the Hobbit”.	Pictograph of a vulture's<strong> CLAW</strong>. The<strong> CLAW</strong> DROPS and leaves a STREAM of blood. *Primitive = vulture.	"Use the ""w"" in<strong> claw</strong> to remember the shape of this kanji."	A<strong> claw</strong>.		
妥		gentle	Vulture . . . woman.		7	785	728	23	ダ		Overly<strong> gentle</strong> <em>women</em> are <em>vultures</em> who want to marry you and steal your money - not true but an easy mnemonic!	An <em>eagle</em> must be extra<strong> gentle</strong> to pick up a dainty <em>woman</em> in its sharp claws.	Edward Scissorhands was very<strong> gentle</strong>, and adored by <em>women</em> in spite of his <em>claws</em>.	Wolverine must be<strong> gentle</strong> when has scratches a woman's back.	Even<strong> gentle</strong> <em>women</em> have <em>claws</em>.		
乳		milk	Fledglings . . . hook.		8	786	729	23	ニュウ	ちち、ち	A <em>fledgling</em> is being nursed at a zoo, it is fed<strong> milk</strong> through a small tube that is bent in the shape of a <em>hook</em> (so that it fits inside its beak). The <em>fledgling</em> soon becomes addicted to<strong> milk</strong>, giving us this very catchy mnemonic: “<em>fledgling hooked</em> on<strong> milk</strong>”.	"Drinking<strong> milk</strong> not only reduces <a href=""../v4/96.html"">cavity</a> (#96 孔)'s but also strengthens <em>nails</em> (claws) thanks astgtciv."	This <em>fledgling</em> is <em>hooked</em> on<strong> MILK</strong>.. better than booze I suppose…	"This is very similar to <a href=""../v4/96.html"">cavity</a> (#96 孔) (""Drink<strong> milk</strong>, it reduces cavities!"", says the dentist). The only difference is that the child here is a <em>baby eagle</em>, a fledgling."	As a <em>child</em>, <em>Wolverine</em> became <em>hook</em>ed on<strong> milk</strong>…and that's how he grew those claws (excess calcium). 牛乳 (ぎゅうにゅう) : cow's<strong> milk</strong>.		
浮		floating	Water . . . fledglings.		10	787	730	23	フ	う.く、う.かれる、う.かぶ、む、う.かべる	<strong>Floating</strong> rubber ducky!!!	A nest of fledglings somehow fell into the water (maybe it was perched on a tree bending over the river), but they are safe for now as the nest is<strong> floating</strong>. The fledglings are enjoying the cruise but they are soon coming to a great waterfall… ( a little drama to help us remember the story).	An ugly duckling (<em>fledgling</em>)<strong> FLOATING</strong> in the <em>water</em>. But this one doesn't grow up into a swan - he's a <em>vulture</em>.	Not too difficult. When you hear<strong> FLOATING</strong>, just think of baby ducks (FLEDGELINGS) in the WATER. Well, you're pretty sure WATER has alot to do with this Kanji.	<strong>The noon sun makes walking on the sand feel so warm. The sea breeze feels so soothing as it caresses my skin. And in the water, dead little fledgings are<strong> floating</strong>. How nice. (and btw, that was sarcasm you dumb douchebags that flagged this!! if you flag, you=DOUCHE OF THE YEAR!!!!)</strong>.		
淫		lewd	Water . . . vulture . . . porter.		11	788	2298	23	イン	ひた.す、ほしいまま、みだ.ら、みだ.れる、みだり	The <em>vulture</em> is on top of the <em>porter</em> and appears to be commiting a<strong> lewd</strong> act, so I throw <em>water</em> over the pair of them.	The PORTER is<strong> lewd</strong> like hell. If a female guest tries to enter the hotel, he throws himself on her like a VULTURE. Therefore it is highly recommended for the ladies to bring some cold WATER and pour it over him to cool him down.	The <em>porter</em> is <em>dripping wet</em> and has <em>claw marks</em> down his back. He receives a big tip for the unspeakably<strong> lewd</strong> acts he committed with a wealthy heiress guest, after she showed she expected more of him than just carrying her bags up to her suite.	"I always knew the Porter was a letch ever since he showed up in the kanji for <a href=""../v4/507.html"">pregnancy</a> (#507 妊). In fact, he's like a <em>vulture</em> that preys on women. Make sure to splash some cold <em>water</em> on that<strong> lewd</strong> creep. 淫ら ; 猥ら 【みだら】 (adj-na,n) loose; bawdy; improper; dirty 姦淫 【かんいん】 (n,vs) adultery."	The <em>porter</em>, who is very<strong> lewd</strong> (there's often something wrong with those guys), likes to watch fetish porn of <em>vultures</em> having sex in <em>water</em>. I think it's a picture vivid enough for the kanji with<strong> lewd</strong> <em>porter</em> jerking off in his room to a TV screening a couple of <em>vultures</em> doing it in <em>water</em> of some pond or such.		
将		leader	Turtle . . . vulture . . . glue.		10	789	731	23	ショウ、ソウ	まさ.に、はた、まさ、ひきい.る、もって	The<strong> leader</strong> in this race is the <em>turtle</em>! It appears he has covered the <em>vulture</em>’s feet in <em>glue</em>, so that the vulture cannot get off the starting block.	X-men and TMNT join forces: Their new<strong> leader</strong> is an awsome asshole. He is simply Wolverine and Raphael glued together back to back (the biggest assholes from both groups combined).	Once upon a time a <em>turtle</em> managed to trick a <em>vulture</em> into <em>gluing</em> itself to the turtle's shell. This way the turtle could now fly anywhere and became the<strong> leader</strong> of the turtles.	A great<strong> leader</strong> must have three things: The robustness of a turtles shell. The shrewdness of a vulture. People that will stick to him like glue and follow him anywhere.	A<strong> leader</strong> should possess the qualities of the <em>turtle</em> - patience and persistance - and the <em>eagle</em> - aggression and good sight. And loads of charisma, so the followers stick like <em>glue</em>. 将来 しょうらい future; 将軍 しょうぐん General.		
奨		exhort	<i>Leader</i> . . . <i>St. Bernard dog</i>. Do not confuse with <i>urge</i> (Frame 300).		13	790	732	23	ショウ、ソウ	すす.める	It's easy to picture a LEADER that uses a BIG dog to<strong> EXHORT</strong> his people to do more.	"Here we have a <em>St.Bernard</em><strong> exhort</strong>ing the vulture to become the <em>leader</em> in the race against the turtle, but he can't because of the glue. see <a href=""../v4/731.html"">leader</a> (#731 将)."	Never support the <em>leader</em>!! Always<strong> exhort</strong> the under<em>dog</em> !!!	A great <em>leader</em> will always<strong> exhort</strong> his followers to go forth and do GREAT and <em>big</em> things.	Think of a dog sled. The LEADER of the pack<strong> exhort</strong>s the St. Bernard's behind him to MUSH! MUSH! MUSH!		
采		grab	Vulture . . . tree.		8	791	2090	23	サイ	と.る、いろどり	You ever wondered why this appeared as a primitive in so many RTK1 kanji? Well, you should know that once a vulture<strong> grab</strong>s hold of a <em>tree</em>, he can never let go. Even Heisig couldn't shake him loose.	A common meaning for this kanji is 'DICE'. — Ever wonder what <em>vultures</em> do up in the <em>trees</em>? They play DICE. But of course, being vultures, they are always <strong>grabbing</strong> the dice away from each other.	The gigantic VULTURE swoops down and<strong> grab</strong>s that huge TREE!! AAAAH!!	Like a VULTURE, she<strong> grab</strong>ed my WOOD! Boy, you cannot stop her.	In a particularly lame X-Men comic, <em>Wolverine</em> is in a <em>tree</em>, and Sabretooth is trying to shake him out of it. <em>Wolverine</em><strong> grab</strong>s the tree trunk as tightly as he can so he doesn't fall out.		
採		pick	Unlike <i>pick up</i> (Frame 720), this character is used for <b>picking</b> fruits from trees. Its elements: <i>finger</i> . . . <i>grab</i>.		11	792	733	23	サイ	と.る	You<strong> pick</strong> cheries with your <em>fingers</em>, then along comes a giant <em>vulture</em> and<strong> pick</strong>s up the whole <em>tree</em> with its <em>claws</em>.	"Tip: <em>vulture</em> + <em>tree</em> : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called <a href=""../v4/2090.html"">grab</a> (#2090 采).

REF: ""grab"" also appears in <a href=""../v4/734.html"">vegetable</a> (#734 菜), <a href=""../v4/1714.html"">coloring</a> (#1714 彩)."	Attempting to use your FINGERS to<strong> PICK</strong> the fruit off the TREE can be hazardous if there's a VULTURE waiting to<strong> PICK</strong> your FINGERS off you!	"采 is grab (FRAME <a href=""../v4/2090.html"">grab</a> (#2090 采))<strong> Pick</strong> is grab but delicately with your fingers only (thanks katsuo)."	Imagine trying to<strong> pick</strong> fruit from a <em>vulture</em>-infested <em>tree</em>, but before you can even get close, the <em>vultures</em> peck at your <em>fingers</em> to stop you.		
菜		vegetable	Flower . . . grab.		11	793	734	23	サイ	な	A vegetarian vulture is munching on a <em>flower</em>, perched on a <em>tree</em>, patiently waiting for a patch of<strong> vegetable</strong>s to grow.	"<em><a href=""../v4/2090.html"">grab</a> (#2090 采)</em> beneath the <em>flowers</em> to get the<strong> vegetable</strong>s. 野菜 やさい."	Wolverine is turning into total hippie. He said he only eats<strong> vegetable</strong>s now and last time I saw him sitting in a tree with flowers in his hair.	Nobody likes to eat their<strong> vegetable</strong>s, not even <em>vultures</em> who will eat anything. So they hide in a <em>flower</em>-covered <em>tree</em>, until the scary<strong> vegetable</strong>s disappear. Picture the ugly vulture head peeking out from behind the flowers.	"Tip: vulture + tree : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called grab (<strong>2090). — Story: Many<strong> vegetable</strong>s are roots and so you take their flowers and grab them in order to harvest the<strong> vegetable</strong>. — REF: ""grab"" also appears in pick (</strong>733), coloring (#1714 彩)."		
受		accept	Birdhouse . . . crotch.		8	794	735	23	ジュ	う.ける、-う.け、う.かる	The bird house is the brothel (someone else said so) and of course everyone is welcome - thay<strong> accept</strong> any crotch.	A <em>birdhouse</em> is a <em>whorehouse</em> that will<strong> accept</strong> any <em>crotch</em> even those with STDs. (Image: a birdhouse whorehouse with every kind of bird coming and going. Some old madam at the front hole<strong> accept</strong>s everyone, even the nasty old crows).	"[WARNING - Possibly offending content] Hard Gay (the Japanese comedian: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaki_Sumitani"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaki_Sumitani</a>) has a <strong>birdhouse</strong> over his <strong>crotch</strong>. It has a note that goes: ""Only cocks are<strong> ACCEPT</strong>ED"". It can't be a coincidence the fact that this is the kanji for 受け , if you know what I mean. フウウウウウウウウウ！."	Can you<strong> ACCEPT</strong> that I like to put my CROTCH in a BIRDHOUSE?	You have to<strong> accept</strong> that your hippie girlfriend has a CROTCH that looks like a BIRDHOUSE (nest).		
授		impart	Fingers . . . accept.		11	795	736	23	ジュ	さず.ける、さず.かる	"""Please <em>accept</em> this <em>finger</em>,"" you say,<strong> impart</strong>ing it to your yakuza boss."	This character depicts a student and teacher. The teacher<strong> impart</strong>s his knowledge on the student, pointing the way and guiding with the finger. Meanwhile, the student sits there passively accepting the tutelage of his superior.	"<strong>Impart</strong> means to ""grant a share of."" so imagine yourself<strong> impart</strong>ing a share of M&M's (with your fingers) and it being happily <em>accept</em>ed by the recipient."	Allow me to<strong> impart</strong> my middle <strong>finger</strong> to those that do not <strong>accept</strong> others for who they are.

Think less about ""I"" (あい) and more about ""we""."	The man is about to enter the '<em>birdhouse</em>' (brothel) when he remembers his true <em>love</em> at home, and, following his <em>heart</em>, uses his <em>walking legs</em> to go straight home.

払		pay	Finger . . . elbow.		5	798	738	23	フツ、ヒツ、ホツ	はら.う、-はら.い、-ばら.い	You're at a restaurant and raise your <em>finger</em> to indicate to the waiter that you want to<strong> pay</strong>. Your friend <em>elbows</em> you in the ribs – it's his shout, and he insists on taking care of the bill.	"You are walking out of the restaurant when the waiter uses his FINGERS to grab you at the ELBOW and says, ""excuse me sir, didn't you forget to<strong> PAY</strong>?""."	It costs an arm and a leg but I<strong> pay</strong> a <em>finger</em> and an <em>elbow</em>…	Traditionally Japanese people kept vallet in their kimono sleeves, so they reach for elbow with their fingers when they want to<strong> pay</strong>.	As if making people<strong> pay</strong> with their <em>fingers</em> is bad enough, the Yakuza now accept <em>elbows</em> as a form of<strong> pay</strong>ment….. :-p.		
広		wide	Cave . . . elbow.		5	799	739	23	コウ	ひろ.い、ひろ.まる、ひろ.める、ひろ.がる、ひろ.げる	The Batcave is very<strong> wide</strong> and has a lot of elbow room for Batman to do his yoga.	"A<strong> wide</strong> cave has a lot of ""elbow room""."	A caveman<strong> wide</strong>ns his <em>cave</em> by pounding on the interior with his strong <em>elbows</em>.	This character depicts that of someone standing at the entrance of a <em>cave.</em> He's standing there with his hands on his hips, and his <em>elbows</em> pointing out to each side. He's telling you that the cave is<strong> wide</strong> enough to walk through comfortably. Try playing with the form of the Kanji to draw out the pictograph I described. :).	The CAVE wasn't very<strong> wide</strong>. Both my ELBOWS touched the sides.

Peter Pan tried to escape, but Hook hooked him by the <em>elbow</em> and <em>bound</em> him <em>up</em>.	"At the risk of confusing with ""captured"" (frame 1018) I'm going to use ""to capture"" as the keyword since this kanji often shows up in kidnapping related compounds and<strong> flexed</strong> is hard for me to work with.

雄		male	<i>By one's side</i> . . . <i>elbow</i> . . . <i>turkey</i>. Its match is in frame 605.		12	804	743	23	ユウ	お-、おす、おん	Men walk with their <em>elbows</em> out from their <em>sides</em> in a weird <em>turkey</em> trot when they try to appear very MASCULINE. Think of a 70's pimp walk.	<strong>Masculine</strong> duties are to offer your <em>elbow</em> to the lady <em>by your left side</em> and to cut the <em>turkey</em> on special meals.	"Surely you remember <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/563"">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌)? In that kanji, we said <em>stop</em>/<em>spooning</em>/<em>turkeys</em>, spoon <strong>females</strong>! Here, once again, my buddy is looking at a <em>turkey</em>. What the heck is his problem? I give him a sharp <em>elbow</em> in the <em>side</em>. ""Dude, be a man!"" I said. ""Where's your MASCULINE side?""."	"While it's not <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/563"">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌) to eat a turkey with a spoon, a <strong>masculine</strong> man would push people a<em>side</em> with his <em>elbow</em> to get to the <em>turkey</em> first."	Imagine a turkey making a pose like it's really buff….it's elbows are by their side at an angle.		
台		pedestal	Elbow . . . mouth.		5	805	744	23	ダイ、タイ	うてな、われ、つかさ	When someone's <em>elbow</em> is above your <em>mouth</em> he/she is probably standing on a<strong> pedestal</strong>.	"After training your whole life, you manage to get a bronze medal in the Olympics. You're extremely proud of your accomplishment as you step up to receive your medal. The guy in first place is up on a<strong> pedestal</strong>, towering above you, his elbow level with your mouth. Being a smug bastard, he ""accidentally"" knocks his elbow into your mouth, causing you to bleed and lose a tooth. Just cause he won the gold doesn't mean he can place himself on such a high<strong> pedestal</strong> and do whatever he wants!"	Rodin's 'Thinker' sitting on a<strong> pedestal</strong>, the arm bent at the <em>elbow</em> cradling the <em>mouth</em>.	Think Indiana Jones… he rests his ELBOW on some ancient<strong> pedestal</strong> to gather his thoughts, when all of a sudden an OPENING appears in a wall and treasure is revealed!	It is physically impossible to put your elbows in your mouth (just try it…) the first one to do so deserves to be on a<strong> pedestal</strong>.		
怠		neglect	Pedestal . . . heart.		9	806	745	23	タイ	おこた.る、なま.ける	While standing on the <em>pedestal</em> at the award ceremony, the recipient <em>heart</em>lessly<strong> neglect</strong>ed to mention the people that got him there.	Someone you put on a <em>pedestal</em> will<strong> NEGLECT</strong> your <em>heart</em>.	"The <em>Gold Medal Winner</em> (see <a href=""../v4/744.html"">pedestal</a> (#744 台)) gets all cocky and<strong> neglect</strong>s his girlfriend (""throws her <em>heart</em> away""). She cries and cries, her <em>heart</em> eventually exploding from the grief and she dies from<strong> neglect</strong>."	People who<strong> neglect</strong> don't put your <em>heart</em> on a <em>pedestal</em>, they put it below it!	If you<strong> neglect</strong> your personal hygiene, you will end up with elbow, mouth and heart disease and wind up looking pretty nasty! Just imagine what you will look like with a locked elbow, your mouth open in a grimace with missing teeth, and one handclutch your heart as it shoots pain through your body! That is the price of<strong> neglect</strong> my friends!		
治		reign	Water . . . pedestal.		8	807	746	23	ジ、チ	おさ.める、おさ.まる、なお.る、なお.す	From his <em>water</em> <em>pedestal</em> Neptune<strong> reign</strong>s over his Sea Empire.	Build a moat around your pedestal to protect your<strong> reign</strong> of power.	The<strong> reign</strong> of the <em>Gold Medal Winner Bastard</em> over <em>water</em> sports is of unsurpassed length. There he is, once again, his hair gray, wearing a bathing cap, on his <em>pedestal</em> with the gold medal around his neck.	Michael Phelps<strong> reign</strong>s supreme as he stands on his <em>water</em>y <em>pedestal</em> (he just got out of the pool).	From his <em>pedestal</em>, Manneken Pis<strong> reign</strong>s over Belgium with his…<em>water</em>.		
冶		metallurgy	Ice . . . pedestal.		7	808	2137	23	ヤ	い.る	The secrets of<strong> metallurgy</strong> and smithing: get your redhot metal and bang it against the <em>pedestal</em> as an anvil. Then cool it quickly with lots of <em>ice</em>.	An ICE PEDESTAL is useless in<strong> METALLURGY</strong> since it will just melt.	I get this confused with all the similar words (forge, tempering, etc.), so I'll make this metal-allergy. The poor blacksmith's son, who had no choice but to take up his father's vocation, spent every day by the pedestal/anvil. Sadly, he had a metal-allergy, so he spent every night putting ICE on his hives…	One secret used in<strong> metallurgy</strong> is to have a <em>ice pedestal</em>, in case you burn your butt.	<em>Ice</em> on the <em>pedestal</em> was no longer a problem thanks to the science of<strong> metallurgy</strong>.		
始		commence	Woman . . . pedestal.		8	809	747	23	シ	はじ.める、-はじ.める、はじ.まる	Many men, before they<strong> commence</strong> their relationship with the <em>woman</em> of their desires, place her on something of a <em>pedestal</em>, which often leads to disappointment later on.	Just think of any art class. You put a WOMAN on a PEDESTAL then you<strong> COMMENCE</strong> to draw her.	If you want to<strong> commence</strong> a relationship, just put a woman on a pedestal and she'll love ya forever.	"After the march of <a href=""../v4/364.html"">intimidate</a> (#364 威) women… the <em>woman</em> stood on the <em>pedestal</em> and <strong>commenced</strong> her speech with, ""<strong>hajimemashite</strong>.""."	Your life <em>commences</em> when the matron (a very fat <em>woman</em>) extends her <em>elbow</em> and takes you out from the <em>womb</em> of your mother. This image will also help you on the next kanji.		
胎		womb	Part of the body . . . pedestal.		9	810	748	23	タイ		"The body part feminists like to put on a pedestal is the<strong> womb</strong>, especially when they hear a man complain about some responsibility. ""We give birth, so it's your duty to do so-and-so""."	If any <em>body part</em> deserves to be put on a <em>pedestal</em>, it is the<strong> womb</strong> from which new life springs forth.	In this kanji pedestal carries a sense of base, or stand. The<strong> womb</strong> is part of the body that acts as a pedestal: a base or stand from which a new human being is brought into life.	"Imagine the <strong>womb</strong> as a <em>part of the body</em> which contains a little <a href=""../v4/744.html"">pedestal</a> (#744 台) for the baby to stand on. Picture the baby, like a little statue of a cherub, standing on its pedestal in the fleshy<strong> womb</strong>."	"I suggest studing this kanji alongside with <a href=""../v4/747.html"">commence</a> (#747 始). The<strong> womb</strong> is the <em>part of the body</em> with a <em>mouth</em> from which the matron took you out when you were born, using her <em>elbow</em>."		
窓		window	House . . . human legs . . . elbow . . . heart.		11	811	749	23	ソウ、ス	まど、てんまど、けむだし	This is either a love scene or a murder scene that you are seeing through a<strong> window</strong>. The love scene: through the<strong> window</strong> of a house (from a distance), you see a pair of human legs, then elbows, and then some pink hearts floating up like in a cartoon. The murder scene: peering through the<strong> window</strong> of a house, you see a gruesome murder scene. Human legs dangling from a ceiling fan, an elbow sticking out of a wall, and a heart still beating on the carpet.	A photographer is at <em>home</em>, recovering his broken <em>human legs</em>. With nothing better to do, he is looking through the rear <strong>window</strong> with his camera (he needs to use his <em>elbow</em> to support those heavy lenses) until his <em>heart</em> begins to race as he witnesses a murder!	A voyeur peeks in the<strong> window</strong> of a <em>house</em>, but all he can see is <em>legs</em>. So he <em>elbows</em> up into the<strong> window</strong> for a better view which gets his <em>heart</em> racing.	When I see that<strong> window</strong> I get chills… I was in that house when my girlfriend threw me out the<strong> window</strong>. She broke my <em>legs, my elbows and my heart</em>!	"The top primitive is similar to <a href=""../v4/1316.html"">hole</a> (#1316 穴). A<strong> window</strong> is a <a href=""../v4/1316.html"">hole</a> (#1316 穴) in your house that you occassionally sit next to while leaning on your ELBOW and gazing out, a picture of a lonely HEARTedness."		
去		gone	Soil . . . elbow.		5	812	750	23	キョ、コ	さ.る、-さ.る	"""Going, going,<strong> GONE</strong>!"", said the gravedigger as he shoveled <em>soil</em> onto the body's protruding <em>elbow</em> (the last bit left to cover)."	If you want the soil stains<strong> gone</strong> from your clothes, then you'll need to put some elbow grease into cleaning them.	"A trick they do in war movies is they bury the arm up to the <em>elbow</em> in the soil, then put some fake flesh and blood by the elbow to make it look like the arm is<strong> gone</strong>. ""AAAHHH!!! My arm's<strong> gone</strong>! MEDIC!!""."	<strong>Gone, past, quit, leave, elapse, eliminate, divorce.</strong> When I <em>myself</em> (厶) am under the <em>earth</em> my time will have elapsed and I will be dead and<strong> gone</strong>. 死去 (death). 消去 (elimination, erasure, purge). 一難去ってまた一難 (it's been one thing after another). 歩き去る (walk away). 洗い去る (wash away). この世を去る (to leave the world, die). 引き去る (retreat). 走り去る (run away).	I brush <em>soil</em> off my <em>elbow</em> - now it's<strong> GONE</strong>.		
法		method	Water . . . gone.		8	813	751	23	ホウ、ハッ、ホッ、フラン	のり	This kanji shows up in a lot of words related to the legal process. Try this image: using a very outdated judicial<strong> method</strong>, the people of Salem dunked accused witches in the <em>water</em> until they were all <em>gone</em>.	"There already was a <a href=""../v4/418.html"">system</a> (#418 制) for butchering cows, a <a href=""../v4/421.html"">technique</a> (#421 芸) for turning smoke into flowers - why can't there be a <em>method</em> of about the same relevance for making <em>water</em> <em>gone</em>? Evaporation anyone?"	Following from the last frame; when rubbing isn't good enough, WATER is the best<strong> METHOD</strong> for making sure the SOIL on your ELBOW is GONE.	If all the water is gone, we must develop new<strong> method</strong>s to survive. (Imagine Earth devoid of water, the opposite of the movie Waterworld).	The Heisig<strong> Method</strong> will Water down your kanji problems, until at some point, they are gone.		
会		meeting	<i>Meeting</i> . . . <i>wall</i>. This is the full character for <b>meeting</b>, from which the abbreviated primitive that we met back in lesson 12 gets its name.		6	814	752	23	カイ、エ	あ.う、あ.わせる、あつ.まる	At the local company they have a very gory way of getting rid of incompetent personnel : they arrange a business<strong> meeting</strong> in a very special room where the walls are …<strong> meeting</strong>. Not surprisingly the boss is never present at these<strong> meeting</strong>s, he's the one who pushes the button that sets the walls in motion.	The only thing created in most<strong> meeting</strong>s is a lot of hot air. Imagine a <em>cloud of it rising</em> to the <em>roof</em>.	Easy: (secret)<strong> meeting</strong>s are held between 4 walls.	No business<strong> meeting</strong> during honeymoon! <em>Ha-Ni-Mu</em>(n) ハニム.	When <em>rising clouds</em> want to hold a<strong> meeting</strong>, they need to an <em>umbrella</em> to gather under and keep them from flying everywhere.		
至		climax	<i>Wall</i> . . . <i>soil</i>. The key word allows for the full variety of connotations: to peak, to arrive at the end, and the like.		6	815	753	23	シ	いた.る	Sexual<strong> climax</strong>es don't always happen on the bed; they sometimes happen against a wall or on the ground!	The<strong> climax</strong> of the Berlin Wall affair was the tearing of it to ground.	The Biblical Onan was condemned for his solo<strong> climax</strong>. Working ONE ELBOW furiously, he spilled his seed on the GROUND, and God was angry at his selfishness and wastefulness. (Perhaps the greatest punishment is that his name has been synonymous with such solitary pursuits throughout the ages since.).	He<strong> climax</strong>ed so hard, it spurted up on to the wall, and he soiled his pants in the process.	You put bags of<em> soil</em> against the bedroom <em>wall</em> to drown out the neighbour's <em>climax</em> noises.		
室		room	House . . . climax.		9	816	754	23	シツ	むろ	"You book a<strong> room</strong> in a love hotel called ""<em>Climax House</em>""."	A simple<strong> room</strong> is made up of a roof, some walls, and a dirt floor.	This is the<strong> room</strong> of a “climax house”, that is, a Japanese love hotel.	"""Jesus, get a <strong>room</strong> you two."" So the couple went back to their <em>house</em> and <em>climaxed</em> there instead."	Under my <em>roof</em>, I've <em>climaxed</em> in every<strong> ROOM</strong>. I also enjoy doing it in different kinds of<strong> room</strong>s: the bedroom ( 寝室 ), Japanese-style<strong> room</strong>s ( 和室 ), even once in a changing<strong> room</strong> ( 更衣室 ).		
到		arrival	Climax . . . saber.		8	817	755	23	トウ	いた.る	"<a href=""Http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/7731/karatesd3.jpg"">Http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/7731/karatesd3.jpg</a> Just look at this image…"	Just as we were about to climax her father arrived with a sword.	<strong>Arrival</strong> of a hero always happens at the CLIMAX of the movie, and of course he carries a SABER to defeat the enemy.	The<strong> arrival</strong> of the main character from Yojimbo back in town with a <em>saber</em> in hand, is the unforgettable <em>climax</em> of the movie.	Musashi's rather late <strong>arrival</strong> for a duel, <em>sabre</em> in hand, is the <em>climax</em> of that novel…		
致		doth	"The archaic English form for ""does"" indicates a humble form of the verb ""to do."" It is made up of <i>climax</i> and <i>taskmaster</i>."		10	818	756	23	チ	いた.す	"This character is used in two very high-frequency words: ""you are welcome"" ( どう致しまして ) and the honorific form of onegaishimasu ( お願い致します ; おねがいいたします). Can't you just picture this ridiculously polite S&M picture? A businessman, who<strong> DOTH</strong> the bidding of his <em>taskmistress</em>, is <em>climaxing</em> and yelling out "" お願い致します "" while she whips and says "" どう致しまして "". (This kanji also means ""to bring about"" and ""do humbly"", which is perfect for this image)."	To reach <em>climax</em> I<strong> doth</strong> the bidding of my dominatrix <em>taskmaster</em>.	"After he had climaxed Shakespeare is reported to have said to his <em>taskmistress</em>, ""The lady<strong> doth</strong> charge too much.""."	Let's have an irreverent take on a line from the play “Hamlet”, by William Shakespeare : “The lady<strong> doth</strong> protest too much.” : “The climaxing taskmistress<strong> doth</strong> whippeth too much”. Our taskmistress is enjoying the whipping so much, she climaxes. My taskmistress image comes from the classic game “Dungeon Keeper”. In this game, the “mistress” character is dressed in a 'domination' outfit, and whips your servants (goblins etc.) to make them work faster.	The <em>taskmaster</em> is my old English teacher. He loved Shakespeare, and the <em>climax</em> if his day was to hear his pupils say<strong> doth</strong>.		
互		mutually	When you draw this character think of linking two <i>walls</i> together, one right side up and the other upside down.		4	819	757	23	ゴ	たが.い、かたみ.に	The 69 position allows both parties to<strong> mutually</strong> give themselves pleasure.	If you can combined your <em>walls</em> with another house's <em>walls</em>, both houses would<strong> mutually</strong> benefit, by the increase in size….	"<strong>Mutually</strong> means ""You and You together""—two katakana ユ (yu)s interlocking top and bottom."	It feels better to imagine two elbows linked together in mutuality.	Pictograph, see book. To me this kanji looks like the T and L of<strong> mutually</strong> (in the first two strokes) mirrored upside-down just like the King/Queen/Valet of a card game. The two L's of<strong> mutually</strong> are there to remind you the pair of TL's are<strong> mutually</strong> joined by the L's (i.e. “two times T and L, joined by the L's”).		
棄		abandon	<i>Infant</i> . . . <i>buckle</i> (See frame 444) . . . <i>tree</i>.		13	820	758	23	キ	す.てる	Think of a really loud and annoying baby, you want to<strong> abandon</strong> it but it keeps coming back…so you take of your belt by the buckle, and buckle the baby to a tree!	"As in <a href=""../v4/415.html"">sash</a> (#415 帯), I treat the <em>one</em> <em>mountain</em> in the middle to mean Mt. Fuji (Japan's ichiban mountain). Now we see an <em>infant</em> being<strong> abandon</strong>ed on top of <em>Mt. Fuji</em> well above the <em>tree</em> line to die of exposure."	A terrible image of an<strong> abandon</strong>ed <em>infant</em>. Here he is in his little car seat <em>buckled</em> to a <em>tree</em>.	<strong>Note</strong>: This Kanji does not contain 山 (mountain) as part of its radicals, it can rather be broken down to 木 厶 凵 亠 一 . Hence, it would be best to avoid using mountain in your story. <strong>Story</strong>: An inhumane way to<strong> abandon</strong> an <em>infant</em> is to <em>buckle</em> him to a <em>tree</em>…	The<strong> abandon</strong>ned <em>infant</em> was <em>buckled</em> to a <em>tree</em>.		
育		bring up	Since the key word has to do with raising children to be strong both in mind and body, it is easy to coordinate the primitive elements: <i>infant</i> . . . <i>meat</i>.		8	821	759	23	イク	そだ.つ、そだ.ち、そだ.てる、はぐく.む	<strong>Bringing up</strong> your offspring means raising them from <em>infant</em> until they are <em>meat</em> ready to be harvested. What, cannibalism is in poor taste? Forget I ever brought it up. But <strong>bring up</strong> will forver be <em>infant meat</em> to me. I want my baby back baby back baby back ribs!	I will<strong> bring up</strong> my <em>infants</em> to eat <em>meat</em>. I'll not endure any vegetarian children in my house!	<strong>Bringing up</strong> an <em>infant</em> requires <em>months</em> of hard work.	Bringing up an infant on the Moon is easier than it is on Earth. (month=lunar) Gravity is lower, so they're easier to carry and they don't get hurt if they fall down. Best of all, their little space suits keep all that poopy smell inside!	Remember The Matrix ? There was a spectacular scene where you could see human <em>infants</em> brought up by the machines, as if they were vulgar <em>meat</em>, for the sole purpose of feeding from the human's biological energy.		
撤		remove	Fingers . . . bring up . . . taskmaster.		15	822	760	23	テツ		A terrible yakuza <strong>taskmaster</strong> is <strong>bringing up</strong> his infant. Every time the infant does something wrong… well, you know what happens to yakuzas when they do something wrong.	"""Don't lay a <em>finger</em> on him,"" a concerned mother says as the state<strong> REMOVE</strong>S her child away for <em>upbringing</em> by a <em>taskmaster</em> foster home."	Ever heard of a kancho? If you haven't, just look it up. ;P Well I think of a kid giving his taskmaster a kancho. His parents, thinking they raised him properly, are appalled when they see this one day and immediately scold him, telling him to<strong> remove</strong> his finger from the taskmaster.	A <em>taskmaster brings up</em> his <em>infant</em> by threatening to<strong> remove</strong> a <em>finger</em> as punishment.	To<strong> remove</strong> your <em>taskmaster</em>, <em>bring up</em> your middle <em>finger</em>.		
充		allot	Infant . . . human legs.		6	823	761	23	ジュウ	あ.てる、み.たす	"Scene at the baby factory: Manager: ""Good news! Your <em>infant</em> has been<strong> allot</strong>ted <em>human legs</em>"". Parent to be: ""Thanks <strong>a lot</strong>!""."	An infant at the maternity ward is<strong> allot</strong>ed a new pair of human legs, because his are not grown properly or absent. Picture the “lot” as a parcel, placed near the infant, to be used later. The “lot” of human legs has been<strong> allot</strong>ed by some doctor, to be used later. Mnemonic “infant<strong> allot</strong>ed new pair of human legs”. Note: to<strong> allot</strong> means to apportion by lots, it has the same root as the word “lottery”.	Each <em>infant</em> gets its very own pair of <em>human legs</em>, <strong>allotted</strong> by God.	In China, you are only<strong> ALLOT</strong>ed one <em>INFANT</em> per family. My friends disagreed with that policy and <em>HUMAN LEGGED</em> it out of there!	God decided to<strong> allot</strong> each infant only <em>one pair of legs</em>.		
銃		gun	Metal . . . allot.		14	824	762	23	ジュウ	つつ	"""Everyone is allotted a metal<strong> gun</strong>"" (US constitution according to the NRA)."	What is a<strong> gun</strong> but a device for <em>allot</em>ting pieces of <em>metal</em>? One for you - BANG!…One for you - BANG!…One for you - BANG!…One for you - BANG!…etc.	During war, all <em>metal</em> is <em>allotted</em> to the effort to make more<strong> gun</strong>s.	If you picture the <em>infant</em> as Stewie from Family Guy, then it's easy to imagine him shaping whatever piece of <em>metal</em> he can get his hands onto into a<strong> gun</strong>. Stewie can already walk, so it's no surprise to see him get out of his cot with his <em>human legs</em>.	Japan doesn't have many<strong> gun</strong>s because they allot their metal to other things like cars and game consoles.		
硫		sulfur	Rock . . . infant . . . flood.		12	825	763	23	リュウ		<strong>Sulphur</strong> is like a <em>rock</em>, but it can stink like a <em>stream</em> of <em>infant</em> doodie.	Infants are baptised in streams inorder to prevent their descent into a place of<strong> sulphur</strong> and brimstone.	<strong>Sulphur</strong> IS a <em>rock</em>, but it often stinks like a <em>stream</em> of <em>infant</em> urine. It is the same color too!!!	"One day a woman found an infant near the brim of a volcanic crater (“brimstone” is another name of<strong> sulphur</strong>) who was made of yellow stone. She brought him back to the village. The next day the village was flooded. The villagers thus cursed the woman for bringing him to the village. – History: In the 8th century AD. Chinese scientists discovered that an explosive mixture could be produced by combining sulfur, charcoal and nitrate. We have learned <a href=""../v4/115.html"">nitrate</a> (#115 硝) and sulfur, charcoal comes in lesson 24."	Imagine an <em>infant</em> stranded on a <em>rock</em> in the middle of a <em>stream</em> of <strong>sulphuric</strong> acid, created by a nearby volcano… (<em>continued in next kanji</em>).		
流		current	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>infant</i> . . . <i>flood</i>. Be sure to distinguish the two water primitives from one another in making your story.		10	826	764	23	リュウ、ル	なが.れる、なが.れ、なが.す、-なが.す	INFANT Moses placed in the WATER and sent down the<strong> current</strong> of the STREAM.	A water-breathing infant (genetically modified?) is caught in a flood, and drifts with the<strong> current</strong>, apparently enjoying himself in the process.	An INFANT fell in the WATER and was lost down the<strong> CURRENT</strong> of the STREAM.	The best way to deal with a <em>stream</em> of <em>infant</em> doodie is <em>watery</em><strong> current</strong>.	…(<em>continued from previous kanji</em>). Unfortunately, the <em>water</em>-level rose and the poor <em>infant</em> was washed away by the <em>stream's<strong> current</strong></em>… dying a sulphurous death.		
允		license	Elbow . . . human legs.		4	827	765	23	イン	じょう、まこと.に、ゆるす	In some Asian kung-fu version of James Bond, the main protagonist has a “License To Kill” with his deadly <em>elbows</em> and <em>human legs</em>. His suit is always stained of red blood at the <em>elbows</em> and <em>lower legs</em> (this to help create an image that distinguish the two elements).	A midget driver trying to pass the road test to get their driver's<strong> license</strong>. Their <em>elbows</em> are too short to turn the wheel and their <em>legs</em> are too short to reach the gas and breaks.	You need a <strong>license</strong> to show your <em>elbows</em> and <em>legs</em> in mid east countries.	To apply for your drivers<strong> license</strong> in Japan, you have to fill out lots of forms at standing-only counters. This kanji is a pictograph of you standing at the counter filling out the forms for your driver's<strong> license</strong>. Your <em>elbow</em> is bent, writing the necessary information on the form (in kanji, of course!); your <em>human legs</em> are getting tired from standing. Why can't they provide chairs and desks?	She did not pass her driver's <strong>license</strong> test: she steered with her <em>elbows</em> while texting and then with her <em>legs</em> while putting on make-up.		
唆		tempt	Mouth . . . license . . . walking legs.		10	828	766	23	サ	そそのか.す	I named the right part <em>legal prostitute</em> has it represents a walker [<em>walking legs</em>] with the <em>license</em>. It's easy to imagine a <em>legal prostitute</em><strong> tempt</strong>ing a man with her <em>mouth</em>.	Prostitutes in Amsterdam have a <em>license</em> to show off their <em>walking legs</em> and<strong> tempt</strong> customers with their <em>mouths</em>.	"Tip : the right side can be thought of as a profession where one works on the street, for which they require a ""<em>license</em> to work on their <em>walking legs</em>"". This could be a <em>sandwich man</em>, or a <em>prostitute</em> (see gorgon's story). In this case, it's easily remembered as a prostitute<strong> tempt</strong>ing passers-by with her <em>mouth</em>. The combination will appear again in frames 1014, and 1437, and another four times in RTK Volume 3, where it is known as <em>streetwalker</em> (which is very close)."	With a hot <em>mouth</em>, a <em>licence</em> to screw and a <em>pair of legs</em>, Amsterdam prostitutes are sure to<strong> tempt</strong> you.	The cop that pulled me over was such a prick, and I was sooo<strong> tempt</strong>ed to <em>mouth</em> off at him! However, I LEFT my mouth shut because I knew if I didn't, he would suspend my <em>license</em> for quite some time, and I'd be stuck with my <em>walking legs</em>.		
出		exit	The kanji for <b>exit</b> pictures a series of mountain peaks coming out of the <i>earth</i>. Learn it together with the following frame.		5	829	767	24	シュツ、スイ	で.る、-で、だ.す、-だ.す、い.でる、い.だす	Suddenly, a <em>cactus</em> comes out of the ground with a sign that reads:<strong> exit</strong>. Now you can leave the desert! (Note: giving this primitive the meaning 'cactus' can be useful later).	The<strong> exit</strong> lays between these two mountains.	A mountain chain blocked our<strong> exit</strong> from Mordor.	Imagine Gollum from LOTR telling you the way to get out from Mordor; the<strong> exit</strong> is behind the stacked <em>mountains</em>.	The two <em>mountains</em> one on top of the other, point to the only <strong>exit</strong> from Earth.		
山		mountain	Note the clearer outline of a triangular <b>mountain</b> here.		3	830	768	24	サン、セン	やま	YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY NEED A MNEMONIC FOR THIS!!!!	Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive this element appears equally as well at the top or bottom of the kanjis (besides appearing to the left). Since a<strong> mountain</strong> often brings to mind towering peaks, I will consider it implied that the element is placed at the top of the kanji. When this primitive appears at the bottom, I will arrange my story in a way that other elements are said to be at the very top of the<strong> mountain</strong> (see FRAME 775 for an example).	Chi chi chi chia. P p p penis!	Stroke order: Begin with the center vertical.	I wouldn't have thrown my <em>walking stick</em> in the <em>trash bin</em> if I'd known I'd be climbing a<strong> mountain</strong>!		
拙		bungling	Fingers . . . exit.		8	831	769	24	セツ	つたな.い	With <em>fingers</em> fumbling around trying to get the key in the door so he could <em>exit</em>, the<strong> bungling</strong> husband woke his wife as he tried to leave for a rendezvous with his mistress.	Horror movie cliche 769: <strong>Bungling</strong> victim's <em>fingers</em> fumble & bungle trying to open the <em>exit</em> door.	You were<strong> bungling</strong> in the darkness and touched the <em>cactus</em> with your <em>fingers</em>. OUCH!!	Here's a guy who's<strong> bungling</strong> his first experience with his hand up a girl's skirt and ends up with his fingers in the exit hole. She yells: get out of my bung-hole!	After the brief press conference in China, the<strong> bungling</strong> President Bush put his <em>fingers</em> on the door to escape, but the <em>exit</em> was locked.		
岩		boulder	Mountain . . . rock.		8	832	770	24	ガン	いわ	A <em>mountain</em>-sized <em>stone</em> is known as a<strong> boulder</strong>.	Here we see <em>mountain rocks</em> rolling down the mountain, gathering into a single monstrous<strong> boulder</strong> crushing everything in its path. Think snowball effect, even if it wouldn't work with rocks.	<strong>Boulder</strong>s are <em>rocks</em> that fall from the <em>mountains</em> above, just like in zelda.	A huge<strong> boulder</strong> (<em>rock</em>) is tumbling down from the mountain (towards you! duck!).	<strong>Boulder</strong>, Colorado the <em>rocky mountain</em> state.		
炭		charcoal	Mountain . . . ashes.		9	833	771	24	タン	すみ	Burn enough<strong> charcoal</strong> and you'll have a <em>mountain</em> of<em> ash</em>.	"You get<strong> charcoal</strong> from volcano (""fire mountain"", 火山 ) ashes."	Imagine a that a <em>mountain</em> fell onto a pile of <em>ashes</em>, compressing it into<strong> charcoal</strong>.	A huge <em>mountain</em> sitting on top of some <em>ashes</em> will compress it into<strong> charcoal</strong> (I know not really - but this makes it easy to remember).	Gas or<strong> charcoal</strong> grill? BBQ aficionados agree:<strong> charcoal</strong> wins. The only downside is the <em>mountain</em> of <em>ash</em> to clean up afterwards.		
岐		branch off	Mountains . . . branch.		7	834	772	24	キ、ギ		On the left, there are three mountains. The road <strong>branches off</strong> to each of them. (Note: This kanji is mostly used for branches in the road).	In a lot of Super Nintendo-era RPGs, there are <em>mountain</em> levels to get through. You view them from overhead, so you can see a mazelike path with many <em>branches</em>. Picture your sprite characters at one such fork in the mountain path, as it <strong>branches off</strong> in two directions.	Mountain branches mean you branched off the mountain path. In other words, once you<strong> branch off</strong> from the mountain path you are going to have to hack your way through the branches.	You want to avoid the mountain road, so you <strong>branch off</strong> to an easier path.	I just picture a tall mountain with many branches growing off its right-hand side. So many, that the mountain loses balance and falls on its side.		
峠		mountain pass	Mountain . . . above . . . below.		9	835	773	24		とうげ	Heisig mentions at kanjiclinic.com that he wishes he'd chosen <strong>mountain pass</strong> for this keyword as it's closer to what the word means. If we do this, the kanji makes complete sense because a <strong>mountain pass</strong> is just <em>below</em> the <em>mountain</em> <em>top</em>.	"To the north of Lorien lies the Misty Mountains, and below their towering peaks are the Mines of Moria. The Fellowship of the Ring first tried for the<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> that goes above, but were halted by the wizardry of Saruman at Caradhras, and so are forced to take the<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> that goes below, through the mountain - a path long feared by Gandalf for the ancient evil that lurks there. Note : the kanji does in fact refer to a ""mountain pass""."	The place on the <em>mountain</em> where you stand <em>above</em> and look <em>down</em> upon all creation is the mountain peak.	You're stuck. You look <em>up</em> and see only <em>mountain</em>. You look <em>down</em> and see only <em>mountain</em>. How the hell do you get out of here? Oh, there's a<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong>. Thank God!	The<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> helps you go <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> the <em>mountain</em>.		
崩		crumble	Mountain . . . companion.		11	836	774	24	ホウ	くず.れる、-くず.れ、くず.す	Sam and Frodo were steadfast <em>companions</em> even as <em>Mount Doom</em><strong> crumble</strong>d above them.	September 11. [lol it also has 11 strokes], whoever reported this story is a loser, get alife. This is the best story on the website.	Sept 11: The <em>twin towers</em> (= 朋 )<strong> crumble</strong> into a <em>mountain</em> of rubble. (thanks liosama).	You and your <em>companion</em> are climbing to the top of the <em>mountain</em> when it suddenly begins to<strong> crumble</strong>. Only one of you can survive - who's it going to be? You or your <em>companion</em>?	The reason to always bring a <em>companion</em> when you go climbing in <em>mountains</em>. It is unsteady and may<strong> crumble</strong> under you at any time. That's when you need that someone to pull you up again.		
密		secrecy	House . . . invariably . . . mountain.		11	837	775	24	ミツ	ひそ.か	To maintain<strong> secrecy</strong>, secret societies invariably have to house themselves in the moutains.	To maintain<strong> secrecy</strong>, secret societies invariably have to house themselves on top of the moutains. (Slight tweak of chamcham's story, using fuaburisa's idea for remembering where to put the mountain primitive.).	"This kanji tells you an original version of ""Brokeback <strong>Mountain</strong>"". Here, the couple of cowboys have fallen in love, and their only way to keep their love in <strong>SECRECY</strong> is by meeting <strong>invariably</strong> at the<strong> house</strong> on the top of the <strong>mountain</strong>."	<strong>Secrecy</strong> in your house, invariably leads to a mountain of trouble.	My lover and I had a <em>house</em> in the <em>mountains</em> so that we could meet in<strong> secrecy</strong>, but it was <em>invariably</em> found out by my wife.		
蜜		honey	House . . . invariably . . . insect.		12	838	776	24	ミツ、ビツ		When I think of<strong> honey</strong>, I think of a bee hive, which is a HOUSE that INVARIABLY has INSECTS.	A <em>house</em> with a lot of<strong> honey</strong> will <em>invariably</em> attract many <em>insects</em>.	The “house” which is invariably divided in hexagons and is full of insects is where<strong> honey</strong> comes from (a bee hive).	<strong>Honey</strong> left in a <em>house</em> will <em>invariably</em> attract <em>insects</em>.	"Think of a queen bee that has been forcefully separated from her ""king bee"" and put in a luxurious beehouse to produce<strong> honey</strong> for a factory. Despite all the homely comforts, she weeps all day from a broken heart, thereby producing some of the most foul-tasting<strong> honey</strong> anyone has ever tried."		
嵐		storm	Mountain . . . winds.		12	839	777	24	ラン	あらし	<strong>Storm</strong> is a full-blown wind that rips the mountains off the ground (you see one flying here).	<em>Winds</em> are gathering at the base of the <em>mountain</em> (note the hint to primitive placement), going up, and turning into a huge mountain<strong> storm</strong>.	What a<strong> storm</strong>! Even a <em>mountain</em> was carried off by the <em>wind</em>!	A<strong> storm</strong> is <em>winds</em> strong enough to lift a <em>mountain</em>!	You are sitting on top of Fuji, enjoying spectacular view of the<strong> storm</strong> below.		
崎		promontory	<i>Mountain</i> . . . <i>strange</i>. Hint: you might save yourself the trouble of a story here simply by recalling the kanji for <i>cape</i> (Frame 164) and toying around with the differing images suggested by the key words <b>promontory</b> and <i>cape</i>.		11	840	778	24	キ	さき、さい、みさき	This is “Cape Strange” from FRAME 153, only with <em>mountain</em> in place of <em>soil</em>. Interestingly, there is also 碕 which is made of the primitives<em> stone</em> and <em>strange</em>. The three kanjis 碕, 埼 and 崎 all have the same meanings and pronunciations. They have very little uses other than names, for which<strong> promontory</strong> is the clear winner with over 2300 uses in place and people names, while the other two kanjis account for less than 200 names.	A<strong> promontory</strong> is a small, <em>strange mountain</em> that juts out into the sea.	<strong>Pro<em>mount</em>ory</strong>. A <em>strange</em> word, indeed.	A<strong> promontory</strong> is a <em>mountain strange</em> (not a mountain range) that juts out like Cape Odd.	Ayumi Hamasaki 浜崎 あゆみ will promote her Nagasaki 長崎 concert with a <em>strange</em> promotional stunt: she will ride a Kawasaki 川崎 to the top of a<strong> promontory</strong> <em>mountain</em>.		
崖		bluffs	Mountain . . . cliff . . . ivy.		11	841	2227	24	ガイ、ゲ、ギ	がけ、きし、はて	"Standing at the base of the<strong> bluffs</strong> I announce, ""I'm going to climb those <em>ivy-covered cliffs</em>, and then the <em>mountain</em> on top of them.""

入		enter	"This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftwards, putting one leg forward in order to <b>enter</b> someplace. Since the ""in"" side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character."	* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: <i>to go in</i>, <i>to put in</i>, <i>to come in</i>, and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for <i>umbrella</i>, the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for <i>eight</i>. When it appears in any other position, however, it retains its original form.	2	842	779	24	ニュウ、ジュ	い.る、-い.る、-い.り、い.れる、-い.れ、はい.る	Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive, using the image of going through a door, even one that stands alone with the frame and no wall around, helps flesh out the primitive “enter”.	Gordon Freeman <strong>enters</strong> the Black Mesa corporation's headquarters on that fateful day, after starting up a game of Half-Life (this kanji looks exactly like the lambda from the logo when written).	"Something only a Native American could pull off instead of saying ""Come in please."". When used as a primitive, instead of<strong> enter</strong>, I use a <strong>tepee</strong> for this character.

込		crowded	Enter . . . road.		5	843	780	24		こ.み、 -こ.み、 -こ.む、 こ.む、 こ.める	During a traffic jam it is impossible to get your car to <em>enter</em> the <em>roadway</em> as it is<strong> crowded</strong> with cars. Think of a grid lock so bad cars are litterally scraping up against each other like people on a Japanese train during rush hour.	Everybody tries to <em>enter</em> the <em>road</em> during rush hour. That's why it's so<strong> crowded</strong>.	"There is a Japanese comedy skit where they play a trick on an unaware person who is walking down a quiet empty street. The trick is that a huge <strong>crowd</strong> suddenly <em>enters</em> the <em>road</em> and stampedes towards the person. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7zwr3vQKo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7zwr3vQKo</a> (thanks, decals)."	Don't enter the main roads in Tokyo on weekdays… they are<strong> CROWDED</strong>.	It's so <strong>crowded</strong> that even <em>stepping into</em> the <em>road</em> doesn't relieve the problem. ('These <strong>Crowded</strong> <em>Streets</em>'; Dave Matthews Band).		
分		part	Go in . . . dagger.		4	844	781	24	ブン、フン、ブ	わ.ける、わ.け、わ.かれる、わ.かる、わ.かつ	When something is <em>entered</em> by a <em>dagger</em>, it ends up being cut in several <strong>parts</strong>.	"(This kanji also has the meanings of ""understand"" and ""minute""). It's important to understand that were you to <em>enter</em> an hour with a <em>dagger</em> and cut it into <strong>parts</strong>, those <strong>parts</strong> would be minutes."	"Perhaps one of the most read kanji in Japanese. It means to understand, to<strong> part</strong>, fraction, to break up, rate, minute, etc. To understand something completly one must <em>enter</em> a <em>dagger</em> into it to break it up into its <strong>part</strong>s. Imagine understanding a body by doing an autopsy(<em>enter, dagger</em>) and studying the <strong>parts</strong>. <a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%88%86%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8A%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B%EF%BC%9F"">分かりますか？</a> ."	I cut the cake in to <em>eight</em><strong> part</strong>s by using a <em>dagger</em>. Then I ate one<strong> part</strong> every minute. (I just found eight easier to use than enter.).	Forget mnemonics for this one. Just look at it, it's a sword<strong> part</strong>ing the line above it (cutting it into two<strong> part</strong>s). Easy!		
貧		poverty	Part . . . shells/money.		11	845	782	24	ヒン、ビン	まず.しい	In the case of true<strong> poverty</strong>, not having money is only part of the problem. There are other components as well, like lack of education, class structuring, etc., but that doesn't really matter. Just remember that the money is only part of it, not the whole.	Parting with your money will lead to<strong> poverty</strong>.	Nice one darg_sama. Since I imagine <em>part</em> as a section of a pie chart, I'll think of a pie chart representing the causes of<strong> poverty</strong>. <em>Shells</em> (lack of money) is just one <em>part</em> of the pie chart.	<strong>Poverty</strong> is having only a PART of the MONEY you need to get by.	Imagine someone so poor they only have part of a penny(or shell).		
頒		partition	Part . . . head.		13	846	783	24	ハン	わか.つ	The PART of my HEAD where I remember the KANJI is in the kanji<strong> PARTITION</strong>.	The last time I tried to<strong> partition</strong> a hard drive under Linux, I got a severe migraine that parted my head.	There are different <em>parts</em> of the <em>head</em> and they each have their own<strong> partition</strong>s: the corpus callosum, the different hemispheres, etc.	The head is<strong> partition</strong>ed into parts. Thinking of the head as a “hard drive” (where all the information we know is stored) we may imagine the head being<strong> partition</strong>ed just like a 3D pie chart.

公		public	<i>Come in</i> . . . <i>elbows</i>.

I always <em>enter</em> the doors to the<strong> public</strong> restrooms with my <em>elbows</em> because I don't want to touch the door with my hands.	The<strong> public</strong> trains in Japan are so crowded, to <em>enter</em> you have to <em>elbow</em> your way in.	It's bad manners to put your <em>elbows</em> on the table when you eat. So, when I <em>come in</em> to<strong> public</strong> restaurants, I always make sure that I keep my <em>elbows</em> down, out of the<strong> public</strong>'s eye.

A<strong> pine tree</strong> is a <em>public tree</em>: they are frequently planted in public squares, in commemoration of the respect Conficius held for them.	The TREES in PUBLIC parks are usually<strong> pine tree</strong>s.	The most common <em>trees</em> found in <em>public parks</em> ( 公園 ) are <strong>pine trees</strong>.	You can't show<strong> pine tree</strong>s in public, because their lower parts are bare.		
翁		venerable old man	Public . . . feathers.		10	849	786	24	オウ	おきな	The<strong> venerable old man</strong> is the <em>public</em> figure head of the Native American Village, answering all questions and solving all problems. The higher in rank you get in this tribe, the more <em>feathers</em> decorate you. Imagine this old man covered in beautiful feathers.	The<strong> venerable old man</strong> is using the <em>public restroom</em> in the park where he feeds the pigeons. But, alas, there is no toilet paper! So, he's caught a pigeon and is using it to wipe his bottom. (note the feathers on the bottom of the kanji, this helps remember placement). Can you see the <em>feathers</em> flying everywhere?	The<strong> venerable old man</strong> is in the <em>public</em> park feeding the <em>pigeons</em>.	Imagine a<strong> venerable old man</strong> sitting on a <em>public</em> park bench, with hair that looks like <em>white feathers</em>.	Whenever I see <em>feathers</em>, I think of <em>Haibane.</em> The <strong>venerable old man</strong> is the <em>public</em> communicator to the <em>Haibane</em>. (Works if you watched <em>Haibane Renmei</em>, I guess.).		
訟		sue	Words . . . public.		11	850	787	24	ショウ		Take care what <em>words</em> you say in <em>public</em> lest you be<strong> sue</strong>d.	[+radical_tyro] <em>Socrates</em> was giving a speech in public. Things were going rather well, until his robe opened a bit and people saw his, well, not-public area. He was promptly <strong>sue</strong>d for public indecency. Certain things shouldn't be made public in public, you know?	George Michael wanted to<strong> sue</strong> the newspapers for all those <em>words</em> about him and <em>public toilets</em>. Unfortunately, it was all true…	If you publicy speak negatively about someone, you can get<strong> sue</strong>d for slander.	"Someone is causing a scene and SAYING in PUBLIC, ""IM GONNA<strong> SUE</strong> YOU!! IM GONNA<strong> SUE</strong> YOU!!!""."		
谷		valley	<i>Go in</i> . . . <i>an umbrella</i> . . . <i>a mouth</i>. Because of space restrictions, the element for <i>go in</i> is shortened in this character. If you stand on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a <b>valley</b> stands out more clearly: the <i>mouth</i> of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way.		7	851	788	24	コク	たに、きわ.まる	This could be seen as a very accurate pictograph of another type of<strong> valley</strong>: a<strong> valley</strong> <em>mouth</em> open under the <em>umbrella</em> of inner labia, with the outer labia <em>parted</em> above. There are even more connections to be made among the primitive keywords and the visuals, but i will <em>enter</em> no further…	Think of the classic anime 風の <strong>谷</strong>のナウシカ (Nausicaa of the <em>Valley</em> of the Wind). We see Nausicaa <em>entering</em> the <em>valley</em> <em>mouth</em> gliding on an <em>umbrella</em>.	Yea, though I <em>enter</em> the<strong> valley</strong> of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for I have brought my <em>umbrella</em> and if anything scares me, I will open my <em>mouth</em> and scream for help!	Pictograph - a little house with mountains behind.	<em>Enter</em> the<strong> valley</strong> with an <em>umbrella</em> and your <em>mouth</em> closed the mist is quite throat irritating.		
浴		bathe	Water . . . valley.		10	852	789	24	ヨク	あ.びる、あ.びせる	This story is quite lascivious, sorry… Now, imagine you are at a 混浴 （こんよく） [two kanjis we now know] Onsen ( 温泉 ), and you are watching a woman<strong> bathe</strong>. Just picture the <em>water</em> dripping down her cleavage (that <em>valley</em> in between her breasts). Note: cleavage in Japanese is 谷間 .	The mountain man uses the <em>water</em> from the <em>valley</em> to<strong> bathe</strong>.	Cleavage in Japanese is called the <em>valley</em> of the chest, and <strong>bathing</strong> sends <em>water drops</em> into that valley. Memorable image, I think you'll agree.	In a <em>valley</em> full of <em>water</em> you may<strong> bathe</strong>.	Green Giant takes a bath in a <em>valley</em> filled with <em>water</em>.		
容		contain	This character depicts a <i>house</i> so large that it can <b>contain</b> an entire <i>valley</i>.		10	853	790	24	ヨウ	い.れる	Imagine a house big enough to<strong> contain</strong> an entire valley. might want to live there. And now imagine cleaning it. . . . Maybe not . . .	Biodome.	To<strong> CONTAIN</strong> the virus, everyone in the VALLEY had to stay in their HOUSES.	You're friends with a giant. Being a genteel creature (and a vegetarian – phew), he invites you for dinner at his <em>house</em>. Not only is it large enough for him, but it <strong>contains</strong> a whole <em>valley</em> inside. It's quite pretty. Imagine walking in and seeing a beautiful <em>valley</em> <strong>contained</strong> within the <em>house</em>.	The sorority <em>house</em><strong> contain</strong>s <em>valley</em> girls.

[melt; dissolve; thaw] An ice cube is <strong>melt</strong>ing, loosing the <em>water</em> it <em>contained</em>.	An inconvenient truth: when the polar ice caps<strong> melt</strong>, there's going to be no way to <em>contain</em> the rising <em>water</em> level…	"Imagine ""WARNING: MAY CONTAIN WATER.

欲		longing	<i>Valley</i> . . . <i>yawn</i>. Be sure to keep the key word distinct from <i>pining</i> (Frame 683).		11	855	792	24	ヨク	ほっ.する、ほ.しい	Guess what? Japanese has dirty words too! (In fact, a lot of them) A sexual story is NOT inappropriate here, as this kanji is very sexual, such as in 性欲 ; lust. As for a story: the <em>lack</em> of contact with a woman's <em>valley</em> will leave a man<strong> LONGING</strong> for love.	The valley has something my life is lacking…. something I've been<strong> longing</strong> for.. peace and quiet.	"Imagine a young girl who has lived in this <em>valley</em> her whole life. She's looking out <em>yawning</em>. When confronted about it, she simply replies ""This is such a <em>valley of lack</em>! There's nothing to do here but <em>yawn</em>! I'm<strong> longing</strong> to get out of here. I'm<strong> longing</strong> for something more than just this <em>valley of lack</em>, this <em>valley of yawns</em>""."	Nausicaa is<strong> longing</strong> to get back to the <em>valley</em> because she is homesick. She <em>lacks</em> her home.	When I lived in the valley I spent all my time yawning - now I find myself<strong> longing</strong> to return.		
裕		abundant	This character shows the typical <i>cloak</i> of <i>valley</i> folk, which, unlike the tailor-made, high-fashion overcoats of city folk, is loose-fitting and free-form. Hence the key word's meaning of <b>abundant</b>.		12	856	793	24	ユウ		"Again using the fact that cleavage in Japanese is called ""<em>valley</em> of the chest"": a woman with<strong> abundant</strong> cleavage tightly wraps up her bosom in a form-fitting <em>cloak</em>, but leaving her <em>valley</em> exposed. Another unforgettable image (thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week)."	Welcome to cloak-valley, the valley where everyone wears cloaks and every shop sells cloaks. Mnemonic : “cloaks are<strong> abundant</strong> in the valley”.	Elven <em>cloaks</em> are<strong> abundant</strong> in the <em>valley</em> of Rivendell.	She used a <em>cloak</em> to hide her<strong> abundant</strong> <em>valley</em> from prying eyes.	[+rtkrtk] It's said that cleavage actually looks like the cleavage of the rear end - in other words, it looks like a bun dent, or <strong>abundant</strong>. Imagine a magazine called<strong> abundant</strong> a-bun-dents, and the winter issue features pretty woman wearing nothing but a heavy trench coat, exposing her<strong> abundant</strong> a-bun-dents, featuring <em>Hidden Valley Ranch</em> seductively poured all over them. Gross, sure, but hey. Whatever works, right? I was having hella trouble with this one.		
鉛		lead (metal)	Metal . . . gully.		13	857	794	24	エン	なまり	Picture the molten <em>lead</em> (the heavy <em>metal</em>) being discreetly drained out of the factory into a <em>gully</em> behind.	<strong>Lead</strong> is a very poisonous metal, and should not enter your mouth.	<strong>Lead</strong> -> Dental fillings -> Metal that enters the mouth to fill a hole in a tooth.	"One term in Chinese for a pussy is the ""golden gully"". That is exactly the literal meaning of the two parts of this Kanji. To get the keyword out of this Kanji just think of all the GOLDEN GULLY's the boys in Led Zeppelin used to fill in thier hayday. Of all the rock bands in history, LE(A)D zeppelin is famous for how much sex they used to have - read ""Hammer of the God's"", if you don't believe me."	This is an odd story. IF you have ever broken a pencil right in two the long way you can see the pencil<strong> lead</strong> lying in the little gully formed by the wood. Helps me remember that<strong> lead</strong> is used in the word 鉛筆 えんぴつ for pencil.		
沿		run alongside	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>gully</i>. The key word is meant to refer to things like rivers and railway tracks that <b>run alongside</b> something else.		8	858	795	24	エン	そ.う、-ぞ.い	<em>Water</em> in a <em>gully</em> <strong>runs alongside</strong> the path.	Picture one of those idiots that<strong> run alongside</strong> the bicyclists in the Tour de France trying to give them water. Watch as the cyclist shoves the person into a gully that <strong>runs alongside</strong> the road.	"Kurisu wrote: Anyone who has been to Japan has seen all the <em>water</em> in the <em>gullies</em> <strong>running alongside</strong> the roads and rice paddies. // Haha, in my parts we call them ""gaijin traps"" because almost every foreigner has run their car/bicycle/drunken ass into one at one point. In fact, if you see a gaijin <strong>running alongside</strong> the <em>water gullies</em> that<strong> run alongside</strong> the road, you may want to see if they need a hand."	Anyone who has been to Japan has seen all the <em>water</em> in the <em>gullies</em> <strong>running alongside</strong> the roads and rice paddies.	Water runs alongside the gully.

You know some foodstuffs (cereals come to mind) sometimes have<strong> prize</strong>s mixed in them? Well, in this case, the<strong> prize</strong> was a shell (money, remember) and you only notice in the outhouse… (see also <a href=""../v4/904.html"">secret</a> (#904 秘))."	You win! Your<strong> prize</strong> is an <em>outhouse</em> filled with <em>shellfish</em>! (Just imagine the disbelief of the contestant…).	Winning the Nobel<strong> prize</strong> gives you <em>ESTEEM ON TOP OF MONEY</em>. (this helps you remember the layout of the kanji too.).		
党		party	Think of this key word as referring to a political <b>party</b>, not a gala affair. Its elements: <i>human legs</i> . . . sticking out of an <i>outhouse</i> window.		10	860	797	25	トウ	なかま、むら	Every major political<strong> party</strong>, if personified, would look like a giant <em>outhouse</em> walking around with <em> human legs</em> spewing out a constant stream of bullshit.	Every political<strong> party</strong> is full of shit. But nobody ever says how they get that way. Well, here's your answer - a political<strong> party</strong> memer is in the outhouse, greedily chowing down on the contents inside. He's grown so accustomed to the taste that he's in all the way, and all you can see are his legs through the window. He'll come inside later to the auditorium to make a speech and spew everything out.	"Here's an easy one from current events. Recently a certain senator, member of a family-values political<strong> party</strong>, was caught in an <em>outhouse</em> touching the <em>human legs</em> of the guy in the stall next to him - who happened to be a police officer. True story, folks - search for ""wide stance senator"" for details."	Politicians in the (insert<strong> party</strong> name here)<strong> party</strong> deliver so much bullcrap, they might as well be outhouses on legs.	Since he refused to become a member of the Chinese Communist<strong> Party</strong>, he was shoved into the outhouse with only his legs sticking out.		
堂		hall	Outhouse . . . land.		11	861	798	25	ドウ		In most communities you will be hauled into city<strong> hall</strong> if you use the <em>ground</em> as an <em>outhouse</em>.	There is a secret<strong> hall</strong> buried in the <em>soil</em> underneath the <em>outhouse</em>.	"The smallest public chamber you can imagine is a public <em>toilet</em> (<em>outhouse</em>): always quite <em>dirty</em>. NB: see also <a href=""../v4/784.html"">public</a> (#784 公)."	Used in school's dining <strong>hall</strong> 食堂 . Story: The food is so bad that you throw it to the <em>ground</em> and run to the <em>outhouse</em>.	Our town's public<strong> hall</strong> is really just a large <em>port-a-potty</em> sitting on a big mound of dirt. Imagine going to an election and having to trudge up a mound of dirt, then sit in a cramped, smelly <em>port-a-potty</em> along with several other citizens just to hear this week's minutes.		
常		usual	Outhouse . . . towel.		11	862	799	25	ジョウ	つね、とこ-	It's<strong> usual</strong> to take your <em>towel</em> with your when you go to the <em>outhouse</em> at the onsen (hot springs bath in Japan) so everybody doesn't see your stuff.	In the <em>outhouse</em> toilet you'd<strong> usual</strong>ly hope to find toilet paper to wipe your ass. If it's already gone, which is<strong> usual</strong>ly the case, simply use the <em>towel</em>.	It's<strong> usual</strong> to carry along your own <em>towel</em> when you are in Japan, because at the <em>outhouse</em>s (public toilets) there are no frickin' <em>towel</em>s (or something else) to dry your hands. (<strong>usual</strong>ly gaijins use there trousers… ).	Tnx Adhmm: a man walks into his pub and says 'the<strong> USUAL</strong>', whereupon the bartender hands him a dirty towel from the floor of the outhouse and he sits there chewing it.	"Showering at your friend's house, you accidently use their good towel. ""Don't use my <em>esteemed towel</em>!"" he cries. ""That's for special guests! Use the<strong> usual</strong> <em>towel</em>!"" At this point, you're offended at not being worthy of his ""<em>esteemed towel</em>"" and storm out of his house, naked and wet."		
裳		skirt	The key word refers to an ancient <b>skirt</b> once used as part of a woman's costume. The primitives you have to work with are: <i>outhouse</i> . . . <i>garment</i>.		14	863	800	25	ショウ	も、もすそ	Compared to pants, a<strong> SKIRT</strong> is the GARMENT to be wearing when you want to use one of those Japanese toilets. It makes it so much easier: you just walk in the OUTHOUSE hike it up, and do your business.	"Haven't you ever noticed that the men / women signs on the front of <em>outhouses</em> are sometimes very similar? The silhouettes are usually the same, but one will decidedly be wearing a <em>garment</em> in the shape of a<strong> SKIRT</strong>. Also, we've already learned the kanji for ""woman"", so if the signs are only in kanji you have no right to wander in and claim ignorance, perv!"	A<strong> skirt</strong> is the most convenient <em>outhouse garment</em>!	Women go to the <em>outhouse</em> by lifting up their <strong>skirt</strong> and under <em>garment</em>s, then laying down a nasty fart laced squirt shit.	In an <em>outhouse, garments</em> can get ruined easily so you might want to hike up your<strong> SKIRT</strong> Nancy.		
掌		manipulate	Outhouse . . . hand.		12	864	801	25	ショウ	てのひら、たなごころ	If you're going to<strong> manipulate</strong> your body with your <em>hand</em>, then go do it in an <em>outhouse</em>, at least!	Instead of magazines, we keep a Rubiks Cube in the <em>outhouse</em> to <strong>manipulate</strong> with your <em>hands</em> while you do your business.	This also means a palm. So you're in the outhouse, <strong>manipulating</strong> something with your hand(palm).	"In islamic countries try to avoid to<strong> manipulate</strong> food with your left <em>hand</em> after you went to the <em>outhouse</em>. (Since that hand is used to clean oneself with water after going to the toilet, instead of using toilettpaper. It's concidered unclean no matter how much you washed it afterwards. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_toilet_etiquette"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_toilet_etiquette</a>)."	Think of students who<strong> manipulate</strong> a pen in their hands to pass the time during classes. Here you<strong> manipulate</strong> something in your hands to pass time while you are in the outhouse. Maybe you're making little balls out of toilet paper, or playing with a Rubik's cube (“Outhouse hands<strong> manipulate</strong>”).		
皮		pelt	"The simplest way to remember this character is to see it as built up from that for <i>branch</i>. The first stroke can then stand for something ""hanging"" down from the <i>branch</i>, namely its bark or <b>pelt</b>. The barb at the end of the second stroke is the only other change. Merely by concentrating on this as you write the following small cluster of characters should be enough to fix the form in your mind. By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji's form to see what you can come up with."		5	865	802	25	ヒ	かわ、けがわ	"A<strong> pelt</strong> is hooked on a branch. A small tent is made with a<strong> pelt</strong> and a branch planted in the ground. The mnemonic hints at the first stroke (the hanging<strong> pelt</strong>) and the hook at the end of the second stroke. This is chinese radical #107 meaning “skin”."	"To be honest, this is one of those cases where I have found it easier to ""just remember it"" as a radical, as it occurs so frequently: 彼 （かれ him） 波 （なみ wave）and so on."	Davy Crocket used to hang his coon-skin<strong> PELT</strong> on a <em>branch</em> that had grown out over the edge of a <em>cliff</em>.	"The head from the tiger<strong> pelt</strong> is hooked over the branch (<a href=""../v4/1990.html"">tiger</a> (#1990 虎) also has this hook on it), and the tiger's tail hangs down on the left. This is Hobbes <strong>pretending</strong> to be a<strong> pelt</strong>, which makes the image not so sad. See <a href=""http://ezoons.com/images/wallpapers/calvin-tree.jpg"">http://ezoons.com/images/wallpapers/calvin-tree.jpg</a>."	The<strong> pelt</strong> Jason travelled so far for was found <em>hanging</em> from the <em>crooked</em> <em>branch</em> of a tree, standing alone on a <em>cliff</em>.		
波		waves	Water's . . . pelt.		8	866	803	25	ハ	なみ	<strong>Waves</strong> are the ocean's pelt (skin).	The Inuit used <em>water</em>-proof seal <em>pelts</em> for their kayaks, to travel the<strong> waves</strong>.	If you can see<strong> waves</strong> appearing in fields of high grass when a strong wind blows, you will easily imagine<strong> waves</strong> appearing in the fur (pelt) of the water (“waves are water's pelt”).	<strong>Waves</strong> blanket the ocean like a WATERY PELT.	<strong>Waves</strong> are <em>water</em> that is <em>pelt</em>ing the shore.		
婆		old woman	Waves . . . woman.		11	867	804	25	バ	ばば、ばあ	An<strong> old woman</strong> is seen here as a woman with waves (i.e. wrinkles, creases).	Picture an<strong> old woman</strong> on her balcony, watching the <em>waves</em>, wondering if her husband will ever return from the sea.	"You know ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Well, this is the sequel, ""The<strong> Old Woman</strong> and the Sea Waves.""."	The Queen. She's an<strong> old woman</strong> who <em>waves</em>.	Come one guys.. this one is staring at you right in the face… water + skin + woman. Ok, no matter what you used int he previous frame thsi will help anyway. When your skin is in water for a long time it turns all wavey and old looking. Woman are always sensitive about looking old. wala.		
披		expose	Fingers . . . pelt.		8	868	805	25	ヒ		You<strong> expose</strong> holes in a <em>pelt</em> by passing your <em>fingers</em> through them and wiggling them on the other side. The sense of the kanji here is to reveal something that was hidden, to make known, to open your heart (thus revealing it, exposing it to others), express your opinion, etc.	Think of it in this vulgar way. You really want her to<strong> expose</strong> her “beaver” <em>pelt</em>, so you have to encourage her with your <em>fingers</em> to<strong> expose</strong> it.	Fred Flintstone gets arrested for <strong>exposing</strong> himself to young cave-ladies. He does this by lifting his pelt with his fingers.	Eskimos don't want to<strong> expose</strong> their fingers from their pelted mitts.	Some girls these days wear their clothes so tight that it's like a second skin, a <em>pelt</em>, if you will, and they<strong> expose</strong> themselves by ripping them off with their <em>fingers</em>, or, at least, I hope.		
破		rend	Rock . . . pelt.		10	869	806	25	ハ	やぶ.る、やぶ.れる	Before the invention of scissors or knives, sharp STONES were used to<strong> REND</strong> PELTs, so that caveman designers could complete new styles for the upcoming year.	<strong>Rend</strong> is a violent, primitive kind of word. (Image: cavemen<strong> rend</strong>ing <em>pelts</em> right off live animals with <em>stone</em> tools).	Me Ugg. Me have rock. Me<strong> rend</strong> pelt with rock.	Hobbes is stalking with his belly low to the ground when a sharp stone<strong> rend</strong>s his pelt (he is, after all, a stuffed animal).	Rock + pelt =<strong> rend</strong>. He then took a sharpened STONE to the PELT and<strong> rend</strong>ed it from the flesh.. 破る yaburu to tear or rip.		
被		incur	Cloak . . . pelt.		10	870	807	25	ヒ	こうむ.る、おお.う、かぶ.る、かぶ.せる	If you wear a coat of fur (pelt) you are sure to<strong> incur</strong> the wrath of animal rights extremists.	A <strong>cloak</strong> of fur (<strong>pelt</strong>) will <em><strong> incur</strong></em> the wrath of animal lovers.	"A fashionable lady decided to put on her cloak of pelt, and thus <strong>incurred</strong> the wrath of animal rights extremists. But don't worry, they weren't brutal or violent: they just shouted ""<strong>ink her!</strong>"" as they stained her valuable cloak."	"Also means ""cover"". Having <strong>incurred</strong> God's wrath, God made Adam and Eve <em>clothing</em> made from animal <em>skins</em> to <strong>cover</strong> their private parts."	<strong>Incur</strong> someone's rage by replacing his fine <em>cloak</em> with a smelly old <em>pelt</em>.		
残		remainder	<i>Bones</i> . . . (parade) <i>float</i>.		10	871	808	25	ザン、サン	のこ.る、のこ.す、そこな.う、のこ.り	The<strong> remainder</strong> of the bones have been thrown from the float (for the dogs maybe, at the end of the parade).	"Throwing all those coins (see <a href=""../v4/368.html"">coin</a> (#368 銭)) was a really bad idea; people got mad with greed. The only<strong> remainder</strong>s left were the <em>bones</em> of those that was on the <em>float</em>."	After the cannibal <em>float</em> had passed the crowd, all that <strong>remained</strong> were <em>bones</em>.	At the halloween parade, there was a <em>float</em> made entirely from <em>bones</em>. Once the parade was over the<strong> remainder</strong> of the bones were left in the streets for the dogs to chew on.	Maths problem - it takes 6 <em>bones</em> to make a <em>float</em>. If I have 37 <em>bones</em> and make as many <em>floats</em> as possible, what's the<strong> remainder</strong>?		
殉		martyrdom	Bones . . . decameron.		10	872	809	25	ジュン		Think of the early Christian martyrs who suffered<strong> martyrdom</strong> because of their faith. See them held in cells for 10 days (a decameron) before being fed to the lions. They appear before the chanting Roman crowds as <em>bones</em> to be devoured. Think of what was leftover after the lions finished them off….nothing, not even a pile of <em>bones</em> to bury.	The <em>boney</em> man martyred himself during his 10 day hunger-strike.	To commerate the saint's <strong>martyrdom</strong> his BONES will be displayed for a 10-DAY-PERIOD (decameron).	"After being bound up for a day (see <a href=""../v4/67.html"">decameron</a> (#67 旬)) there was nothing left of Heisig but BONES. He had attained<strong> MARTYRDOM</strong> for the sake of an obscure keyword…"	Nice. If you know about the Canterbury Tales, you know they were pilgrims going to see a martyrs tomb. Just imagine that they're going to see the <em>relics(bones)</em> of that <strong>martyr</strong> on their <em>decameron</em>!		
殊		particularly	Bones . . . vermilion.		10	873	810	25	シュ	こと	A t-bone steak is vermilion -<strong> particularly</strong> if served rare.	Castlevania – The <em>vermillion</em> skeletons (<em>bones</em>) are<strong> particularly</strong> hard because they just keep regenerating.	[Too abstract, so:<strong> particularly</strong> -> particles as recall hint. ] The <em>bones</em> had enough <em>vermillion</em> particles on them to identify the victim. DNA is<strong> particularly</strong> accurate.	The vermilion bone is<strong> particularly</strong> (especially) different from the others (it's a dog toy made of rubber).	"""Not<strong> PARTICULARLY</strong>,"" I said when asked if I was interested in buying a <em>vermillion</em> <em>bone</em>."		
殖		augment	Bones . . . straightaway.		12	874	811	25	ショク	ふ.える、ふ.やす	Advertisement for Breast Implants – Tired of nights all alone? Want to get <em>boned straightaway</em>?<strong> AUGMENT</strong> your breasts and all your troubles will be solved!	In the movie “Gattaca”, Vincent Freeman (played by Ethan Hawke)<strong> augment</strong>s his size by straightening his bones (his legs), in order to match up with the genetically “perfect” population, and reach his goal of travelling in space. The stretching of his lower leg bones involved multiplying the bone cells, another sense of this key word.	He wanted to<strong> augment</strong> his height so had some <em>bone</em> added to his legs <em>straightaway</em>.	Wolverine has had his body specially<strong> augment</strong>ed. He has special super-<em>bones</em> and the ability to heal <em>straightaway</em> after any injury.	"This kanji actually means <strong>multiply/reproduce</strong>. God said, ""Be fruitful and multiply."" When Adam saw his partner, he <em>straight away</em> said, ""this is <em>bone</em> of my bone"" (since she was made from his rib)."		
列		file	<i>Bones</i> . . . <i>saber</i>. The sense of the key word is of people or things lined up in a row.		6	875	812	25	レツ、レ		A line of skeletal warriors, all armed with sabers.	Skeleton army rank and<strong> file</strong>. Dudes made of <em>bones</em> carrying <em>sabres</em>.	"Common scene in (old) computer rpgs. Skeletons with sabers coming at you neatly in a<strong> file</strong>. (see <a href=""../v4/1288.html"">skeleton</a> (#1288 骨))."	Really this means things/persons lined up in a <strong>row</strong> (as opposed to 'columns'). So just picture a <strong>row</strong> of neatly lined up <em>bones</em><strong> file</strong>d next to a <strong>row</strong> of nicely lined up <em>swords.</em> Must be some sort of Khmer Rouge memorial. Now picture the people <strong>lining up</strong> outside the museum to<strong> file</strong> past those <strong>rows</strong> of <em>bones</em> and <em>swords.</em> Now you remember this kanji is good for both things and people.	Imagine dead soldiers standing in<strong> file</strong> to get into afterlife: bones of severed limbs in one hand, saber in the other.		
裂		split	File . . . garment.		12	876	813	25	レツ	さ.く、さ.ける、-ぎ.れ	They tried issuing the <em>skeleton warriors</em> with proper <em>garments</em> to wear, but they kept getting<strong> split</strong> by the sharp bones or by their <em>sabres</em>. In the end, it was decided they look scarier naked anyway.	Someone takes a sword made of bone to<strong> split</strong> the garment right down the middle. Very effective.	My <em>boner</em><strong> split</strong> a hole in my <em>pants</em> like a <em>saber</em>.	We should walk in single <em>file</em> so no one sees I<strong> split</strong> my <em>undergarments</em>! (Undergarments should help with position).	Think about what happens when you<strong> split</strong> your pants….the tear makes a <em>line</em> in your <em>garment</em>.		
烈		ardent	File . . . oven fire.		10	877	814	25	レツ	はげ.しい	The nazis were<strong> ardent</strong> believers in the master arian race, see them marching everyone else into the <em>oven fires</em>, single <em>file</em>.	The undead, marching single <em>file</em>, prove how<strong> ardent</strong> they are be walking across a field of <em>flame</em>. Fun fact,<strong> ardent</strong> used to mean to <em>burn</em>.	"<strong>Ardent</strong> followers (skeleton army), <a href=""../v4/812.html"">file</a> (#812 列), would <em>file</em> over <em>hot coals</em> for their master."	My Japanese students have such an<strong> ardent</strong> desire to speak native English that you will never find any of them confusing <em>file</em> with <em>fire</em>.	People can get really extreme and<strong> ardent</strong> in the <em>line of fire</em>.		
死		death	"<i>Bones</i> . . . <i>spoon</i>. Note how the first stroke is extended to the right, forming a sort of ""roof"" overhead."		6	878	815	25	シ	し.ぬ、し.に-	Ok, this is where knowing some Eastern culture comes in handy! In Japanese society, when someone dies they creamate the body and pick out the remaining bones with special chopsticks. In this case, they're out of chopsticks so they decide to use (gasp!) a spoon instead.	Imagine the grim reaper (the bringer of<strong> death</strong>), carrying a <em>spoon</em> made of human <em>bones</em> instead of a scythe.	The Grim Reaper eats bones for breakfast (with a spoon).	"Remeber <strong>DEATH</strong> from Terry Pratchett's Discworld books? Now picture <em>bony</em> <strong>DEATH</strong> as he sits down (in the book ""Mort"") in the restaurant together with his new apprentice to eat a bowl of hot curry with a <em>spoon</em>."	<em>One evening</em> I choked to<strong> death</strong> on a <em>spoon</em>. (Don't ask how I wrote this…).		
葬		interment	<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>death</i> . . . <i>two hands</i>. Do not confuse with <i>bury</i> (Frame 191).		12	879	816	25	ソウ	ほうむ.る	I imagine an<strong> interment</strong> as a funeral. At this funeral it's an open casket, and the dead body (death) is holding flowers with both of its hands.	During the<strong> interment</strong> ceremony, the grandchildren placed <em>flowers</em> over the <em>dead</em> body while the widow sat praying with <em>two hands</em>.	During<strong> interment</strong>, flowers are placed above <em>death</em>, while <em>two hands</em> from the netherworld are pulling from below.	We see <em>Death</em> himself standing at a funeral. This time he's not holding his scythe, but he has <em>flowers</em> in both hands.	"I used to confuse 亡 and 死 in this kanji, so I use the image of 死神 (shinigami, or death god) to help remember the right element.— At this<strong> interment</strong> funeral, underneath the <em>flowers</em> on top of the grave, the <em>death god</em> ( 死神 ）, is descending towards the underworld, lowering the coffin with <em>both hands</em>. ソウ <a href=""midori://search?text=%E8%91%AC%E5%BC%8F%E3%80%82%E8%91%AC%E3%82%8B"">葬式。葬る</a> ."		
瞬		wink	Eye . . . birdhouse . . . sunglasses.		18	880	817	25	シュン	またた.く、まじろ.ぐ	What a dilemna, you wore SUNGLASSES over your EYES when you went to the BIRDHOUSE so you wouldn't be recognized - but now you can't<strong> WINK</strong> at the girl you want!	Imagine Snoopy<strong> wink</strong>ing with his big <em>eyes</em> (and a happy smile) standing next to Woodstocks <em>Birdhouse</em>, woodstock being so cool that he wears little <em>sunglasses</em>.	At the <em>whorehouse</em> a girl pulled down her <em>sunglasses</em> and<strong> wink</strong>ed at me with a <em>single massive eye</em> OMG SHE'S A CYCLOPS. Didn't stop me though.	Out of the corner of your eye, you thought some cute girl was<strong> wink</strong>ing at you, but it turns out it was just a birdhouse with sunglasses. Isn't that always the way it turns out.	"I prefer to use the 舛 to mean ""dancing legs"". Makes a lot more sense to me that way. Just think of it as in the evening, you want to watch dancing legs, (you can see the two legs wrapped around a pole… right? ;) ) You go to a certain kind of ""BIRD"" HOUSE, to watch the DANCING LEGS. Your EYE is drawn to one particular set of dancing legs in the birdhouse, she has a twinkle in her eye and you blink as she<strong> WINK</strong>S at you. (This kanji also means blink and twinkle)."		
耳		ear	The pictograph for the <b>ear</b> looks much like that for <i>eye</i>, but note how the stroke order gives it a different look.		6	881	818	25	ジ	みみ	Your<strong> ear</strong> is like the eye on the side of your head for seeing things, but there is hair around it that creates jagged lines.	Just remember it.	Pictograph, see book. * The primitive meaning can easily be extended to<strong> ear</strong> plugs.	Deaf people use their<strong> ear</strong>s as <em>eyes</em>. An<strong> ear</strong> is just a modified <em>eye</em>.	"Correct stroke order: Begin with capital T, add two horizontals from capital F. Then add the ""scissors"" from 斗 <a href=""../v4/1177.html"">Big Dipper</a> (#1177 斗)… Remember: the horizontals overextend at all 4 corners, but the verticals overextend ONLY at the bottom right corner… 耳 [みみ]."

Fuaburisu's with a twist: You know that classic trick where someone pretends to<strong> take</strong> something out of an someone else's <em>ear</em> (such as a coin). Instead of a cigarette or a pen he pulls the person’s <em>crotch</em> out of their ear. Very painful!	Someone does the classic magic trick of pretending to<strong> take</strong> something out of their ear (such as a coin). Or maybe it is a cigarette or a pen that you<strong> take</strong> from behind the ear (the crotch of the ear).

Yeah, that's the<strong> gist</strong> of it!	I gotta RUN soon so I will just TAKE the<strong> GIST</strong> of your otherwise long-winded story.	Advice for learning japanese: Just take the words you know, and run with them. You'll soon get the<strong> gist</strong> of it.

恥		shame	<i>Ear</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. It is most rare to have the <i>heart</i> at the right, rather than at the bottom.

Amelia Ear-Heart (sic) brought<strong> shame</strong> to those who said women couldn't fly.	This chinese character explains how<strong> shame</strong> stands between social expectations (the <em>ear</em> listening to the outside world) and one's own expectations (one's <em>heart</em>).

Buckingham Palace guards are famous for staying at their<strong> post</strong> no matter what, even if you blow a <em>kazoo</em> in their <em>ear</em>!	You want to leave your<strong> post</strong> when you hear the sound of the fiesta.	A guard stands at his<strong> post</strong>, listening for approaching intruders. If he hears anyone coming, he must sound out the warning signal – which is (due to budget cuts) just a kazoo.	"From Star Wars: Episode IV. ""TK-421, why aren't you at your<strong> post</strong>?

聖		holy	Ear . . . mouth . . . king.		13	888	825	25	セイ、ショウ	ひじり	A<strong> holy</strong> man hears with his <em>ears</em> before he speaks with his <em>mouth</em>, which places him higher than a <em>king</em> in people's esteem.	The trick for me is to remember that the 耳 is to the left of the 口 . However, this is easy because a true<strong> holy</strong> man uses his <em>ear</em> to listen (i.e., to God or his supplicant) before he opens his <em>mouth</em> to speak, unlike a charlatan who just makes something up. Of course, <em>king</em>s are often true<strong> holy</strong> men and prophets (e.g., King David in the bible).	<strong>Holy</strong> Hand Grenade: Monty Python: Quest for the<strong> Holy</strong> Grail. The rabbit just tore the ear off of a knight with it's fierce mouth. The knight is running back, screaming, and the King is watching. He decides to call out for the<strong> Holy</strong> Hand Grenade to fix the situation.	Since God will only speak to the people through the king (or so he says, anyway), his ears and mouth are therefore<strong> holy</strong>.	<strong>Holy</strong> men always seem to have their <em>mouths</em> in the <em>ears</em> of <em>kings</em> and other important leaders. Think Rasputin…

See that ear nailed over there ? It's the ear of the last person who was too<strong> daring</strong> with the taskmistress.	English (punk) teenagers in the 70s were<strong> daring</strong> when they pierced <em>nails</em> through their <em>ears</em>. Many of them got in a lot of trouble with their <em>taskmasters</em> (parents, teachers, etc.).	"The<strong> daring</strong> schoolgirl whispers, ""Come <em>NAIL</em> me,"" in the <em>EAR</em> of the <em>TASKMASTER</em>…"	You must be<strong> DARING</strong> to use a SPIKE to tickle the top of the EAR of the TASKMASTER, very<strong> DARING</strong> indeed!

(Intentionally said backwards to get the order of the primitives correct).	"<strong>Listen</strong>ing to others is different from hearing [1626] with the <em>ear</em>. One must allow the words to pierce through the <em>eyes</em> (the window of the soul) and reach deep into the <em>heart</em>…a symbol of thinking about and contemplating on what was said, not just the sounds of words spoken. A married man while reading his newspaper, his wife going on about something suddenly, says, ""You're not<strong> listen</strong>ing to me, are you?"" He replies, ""I heard every word you said. You said…"" “Yes, but you're not<strong> listen</strong>ing.""."	"A doctor is<strong> listen</strong>ing as best as he can to someone's heart, but even with the stethoscope the doctor can not hear anything, because the patient's heart is ""so small it could pass through the eye of a needle"" (see frame 400). Contrast with passive ""hear"" of frame 1626."	When you really<strong> listen</strong> to another person and not just hear them, you use your ears like ten eyes and see their heartfelt meaning.

慢		ridicule	State of mind . . . mandala.		14	892	829	25	マン		"I'll focus on the <strong>mandala</strong> primitive here. I guess Heisig chose this keyword for phonetic reasons and as a character it's the ""man"" in mandara/mandala ( 曼荼羅 ).

He' s often<strong> ridicule</strong>d for having his <em>eye</em> on <em>crotches</em> all <em>day</em>.	Heisig really dropped the ball on this one, introducing the obscure primitive <em>mandala</em> without a word of explanation. I choose to read it as <em>Nelson Mandela</em> instead. Picture him under the hot <em>sun</em>, being tormented by <em>cyclopes</em> who constantly kick him in the <em>crotch</em> in his South African prison. Therefore, this kanji: The <em>state of mind</em> of <em>Nelson Mandela</em> was to constantly<strong> ridicule</strong> the Apartheid system.	The whole crew <strong>ridicules</strong> <em>Data</em> as he's on a big hippy phase wearing <em>mandalas</em> and such trying to explore human behavior.

"In my diccionary this kanji appears to have nothing to do with ""ridicule"" and a lot more with ""pride"" and ""conceit"": You may<strong> ridicule</strong> others because you are so <strong>conceited</strong> that in your <em>state of mind</em> you are at the center of the <em>mandala</em>."		
漫		loose	Water . . . mandala.		14	893	830	25	マン	みがりに	One obscure Tibetan sect– the Otaku cult– has an unusually<strong> loose</strong> interpretation of mandala drawing practice. Instead of traditional mandalas they draw mangas ( 漫画 ). They then pour water on the image to wash it away, and begin anew.	Staring at <em>mandalas</em> is a tool in meditation to <strong>loosen-up</strong> the mind and body, allowing the energy to flow like <em>water</em>.	Even NELSON MANDALA dreams of drops of WATER glistening on comic book/ anime girls with<strong> LOOSE</strong> morals. (This story has been edited in response reports).

On the JET Programme, many people have their <em>eye</em> on a<strong> placement</strong> in Tokyo, Osaka or another big city, and write it on their application form. They are usually sent to the countryside <em>straightaway</em>.	To ensure the correct<strong> placement</strong> of anything, your turn your <em>eye</em> sideways and look <em>straightaway</em> to line it up. (Image: something specific your fixing correct<strong> placement</strong> for. Maybe trying to fit a fishhook through the eye of a neele…).	The<strong> placement</strong> of a cyclopes' <em>eye</em> allows him to only look <em>straightaway</em>.

罰		penalty	Eye . . . words . . . saber.		14	896	833	25	バツ、バチ、ハツ	ばっ.する	For Japanese, when the mind's eye (the sideways eye) feels guilty for something bad that the body has done, there are two<strong> penalty</strong>s to choose from. One, you can say I'm sorry. Two, you can commit suicide by sabre. Why, oh why, do so many Japanese executives commit suicide at the first sign of scandal when all the have to do is say I'm sorry to get off the hook. (on yomi: バチ, バツ).	There is a 3-way masterplan for every goalkeeper to prevent a goal at<strong> penalty</strong> shootout: 1. Look directly into the <em>eyes</em> of the player — 2. Confuse him by screaming senseless <em>words</em> — 3. Pull out you your <em>saber</em> and … (that's up to you).	"This keyword must be kept separate from ""penal"" and ""punishment"". I use the game-specific meaning of ""penalty"". Imagine a game of scrabble with a mechanical, computerized surveillance camera (the all-seeing EYE) as the game master, monitoring what the players do. If a scrabble player tries to form a WORD that is not in the robot's dictionary, that player is immediately hit with a<strong> PENALTY</strong>, and the robot uses his robotic arm to automatically injure the offending player with a SABER."	This kanji is a timeline. First we have the <em>eye</em> wittness observing the crime, then we have the prosectuor <em>talking</em> about the crime in court, finally we have the guilty being <strong>penalised</strong> for his crimes.

寧		rather	House . . . heart . . . eye . . . spike.		14	897	834	25	ネイ	むし.ろ	"A pretty tough kanji. Think of elegant old housewives with English accents dining together at a HOUSE party. The hostess brings out a dish of hors d'oeuvres: a SPIKE of metal with an EYEBALL and a HEART skewered on it. Upon being offered this treat, one of the housewives says in her English accent, ""I'd<strong> RATHER</strong> not.""."	<strong>Rather</strong> a house with a heart than an eye with a spike.	Did your parents ever tell you that <em>home</em> is where the <em>heart</em> is? Maybe that's because they want to keep an <em>eye</em> on you. They'd<strong> rather</strong> you were inside, than on the <em>streets</em>. Sadly, crack doesn't sell itself.	I'd<strong> rather</strong> die peacefully in my <em>house</em> from a <em>heart</em> attack than from a <em>spike</em> in my <em>eye</em>.	"Picture a racist railroad foreman from the days when the wild west was being tamed. ""I'd<strong> rather</strong> be at my house eatin' and drinkin' my way to a heart attack than watching these slanty eyed Chinese immigrants hammering railroad spikes""."		
濁		voiced	"The key word for this kanji connotes the ""muddying"" effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a ""j"" is <b>voiced</b> while a ""sh"" is unvoiced. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is <b>voiced</b>. The primitives are: <i>water</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>insect</i>."		16	898	835	25	ダク、ジョク	にご.る、にご.す	"The fly is wrapped in a spiderweb voicing ""Help me, Help Me"" under the watchful eye of the spider who's venom is dripping like water from her fangs."	Pour <em>water</em> over the <em>eyes</em> of a <em>bound up</em> <em>insect</em> if you want to hear a pitiful buzz that is very similar to a<strong> VOICED</strong> consanant.	This is how to produce<strong> voiced</strong> consonants, like Z: [1] use lots of saliva (<em>water</em>); [2] you can <em>see</em> the vibrating of the vocal chords in a mirror; [3] the sound is that of a zzzzooming <em>insect</em>, as if <em> bound up</em> in your throat.	"<strong>Voiced</strong> here refers to the ""muddying"" effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For the image of muddy, we have an <em>insect</em> that is <em>bound up</em> and lowered into the <em>water</em> as bait. As it struggles for its life, it stirs up the sediment at the bottom, muddying the <em>water</em> such that your <em>eyes</em> cannot see through it."

環		ring	<i>Jewel</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>scarf</i>. The number of elements is large here, so take extra care. Learn it in conjunction with the next frame, since these are the only two cases in this book where the combination of elements to the right appears.		17	899	836	25	カン	わ	Together with the next kanji, the keywords spell “send back the<strong> ring</strong>”. First we have a <em>jewel</em>. Next we have the <em>great eye</em> of Sauron searching for the fellowship hiding under the many <em>ceilings</em> during their journey. The fourth and fifth primitives are the <em>mouth</em> of Gollum always mumbling “My preciousss”; and Pippin's <em>scarf</em>! Placement: the eye appears at the top similarly to how the Great Eye of Sauron is perched atop the Dark Tower.	"In conjunction with <a href=""../v4/837.html"">send back</a> (#837 還)……. When I tried to give her the <em>jewel</em><strong> ring</strong>, she <em>eyed</em> me, threw it to the <em>floor</em>, opened her <em>mouth </em>and tried to speak, she said nothing. She grabbed her <em>scarf</em> and left."	The Saudi woman accepted the marriage<strong> ring</strong>, though it meant lowering her eyes to the floor and covering her mouth with a scarf.	"There's no ""jewel"" in this kanji!! It's a ""king"" you idiots!"	The one<strong> ring</strong> is the <em>jewel</em> that the <em>eye</em> of Sauron, above the <em>ceiling</em> of his tower, is searching for. To get it back, Sauron sends his nazguls, whose insubstantial <em>mouths</em> are hidden behind a <em>scarf</em>.		
還		send back	Road . . . eye . . . ceiling . . . mouth . . . scarf.		16	900	837	25	カン	かえ.る	You've probably guessed it by now, this is the <em>road</em> that Sam and Frodo take to<strong> send back</strong> the <em>ring</em> to Mount Doom! (see previous frame, the <em>jewel</em> is replaced by the <em>road</em>).	"Continued from <a href=""../v4/836.html"">ring</a> (#836 環)……. So I'm on the <em>road</em> going to <strong>send back</strong> the <em>ring</em> minus the <em>jewel</em>, the hit to the floor knocked it out."	"A <a href=""../v4/836.html"">ring</a> (#836 環) with no <em>jewel</em>?! she screamed and told her fiance to hit the <em>road</em> - she'd<strong> send back</strong> the ring."	The Saudi woman was tired of looking at the floor and covering her mouth with a scarf, so she asked her husband to send her back on the road to home, though she didn't<strong> send back</strong> the ring.	This shows the <em>road</em> travelled by Frodo in the Lord of the Rings to<strong> send back</strong> the <em>One</em> ring to the <em>mouth</em> of Mordor…wrapped delicately in a <em>silk scarf</em>, of course. All the while, the <em>eye</em> of Sauron looks on.		
夫		husband	"The kanji for <i>a</i> <b>husband</b> or ""head of the family"" is based on the kanji for <i>large</i> and an extra line near the top for the ""head."" Recall the kanji for <i>heavens</i> already learned back in frame 457, and be sure to keep your story for this kanji different."		4	901	838	25	フ、フウ、ブ	おっと、そ.れ	Even though it is argued size is not important, I'm sure most women would like their<strong> husband</strong> to have a <em>big one</em>.	Homer Simpson, as a primitive.	After marriage, most men let themselves go a bit, and the result is predictable: <em>one large</em><strong> husband</strong>.	My <em>husband</em> is sent from <strong>heaven</strong>, and his head still pokes out a little.	The bride of Frankenstein owns this kanji. It represents her<strong> husband</strong>: <em>large</em> with a long <em>bolt</em> through his neck.		
扶		aid	Fingers . . . husband.		7	902	839	25	フ	たす.ける	In Homer Simpsons' house, the first<strong> aid</strong> kit is usually used for when he smashes his fingers trying to build something (there are countless Simpsons episodes you can draw from for this).	A husband doesn't lift a finger to<strong> aid</strong> his partner.	"Band-Aids were invented by a <em>husband</em> for his wife, who would regularly injure her <em>fingers</em> while cooking. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-Aid"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-Aid</a>."	When a woman can't open a jar, her <em>husband</em> comes to her<strong> aid</strong> with his strong <em>fingers</em>.	"To fulfill his <em>husband</em>ly duties, sometimes the ""<em>big one</em>"" requires a little<strong> aid</strong> from his partner's <em>fingers</em>. This kanji is a very graphic representation of this act, and should probably be censored."		
渓		mountain stream	Water . . . vulture . . . husband.		11	903	840	25	ケイ	たに、たにがわ	The Simpsons are on vacation. <em>Homer</em> stops to take a leak in a <strong>mountain stream</strong> but gets snatched by an <em>eagle</em>. Hear his scream?	"A husband who went fishing at the<strong> mountain stream</strong> to feed his family, fell in the rapids (we'll assume this is a large<strong> mountain stream</strong>). He is saved from the waters by a great eagle. He comes back home with nothing to feed the family, his clothes still dripping wet as he tells his wife of how he was saved by a great eagle, and of course she does not believe him. The story continues in <a href=""../v4/1947.html"">chicken</a> (#1947 鶏)."	The water from the<strong> mountain stream</strong> saved my husband from thirst, dehydration and the vultures.	"The <em>water</em> from the<strong> mountain stream</strong> saved the <em>husband</em> from <em>vultures</em> (see <a href=""../v4/1947.html"">chicken</a> (#1947 鶏) for another example of vulture over husband)."	Did you ever wonder where the <em>water</em> in<strong> mountain stream</strong>s came from? It comes from <em>vultures</em> peeing. Anyone knowing the anatomical and temperamental differences between the sexes will also realize that the <em>water</em> comes from the <em>vulture</em> <em>husbands</em>.		
規		standard	Husband . . . see.		11	904	841	25	キ		In the male-dominated world of yesterday, the husband's way of seeing things was considered the<strong> standard</strong> point of view. Women who dared to disagree were frowned upon.	Unfortunately, Homer Simpson is the<strong> standard</strong> model of a husband in American society. (Placement: You have to <em>look</em> in the RIGHT places to find one that doesn't fit that mold.).	<em>Husbands</em> that still <em>look</em> (at beautiful women, at porn) are the<strong> standard</strong>. Those that don't are either saints and martyrs, asexual or blind.	Ugh. You can tell what her<strong> standard</strong>s are just by <em>seeing</em> her <em>husband</em>.	The<strong> standard</strong> <em>husband</em> does a lot of <em>watching</em>, when the wife is NOT <em>watching</em> that is!		
替		exchange	Two husbands . . . day.		12	905	842	25	タイ	か.える、か.え-、か.わる	"A show like ""Trading Spouses"" called ""exchanging husbands"" where 2 husbands are<strong> exchange</strong>d for a day (thanks dingomick)."	Marge's dream: to<strong> exchange</strong> <em>Homer</em> for another <em>husband</em> for just <em>one day</em>.	There will come a <em>day</em> when <em>two husbands</em> can<strong> exchange</strong> vows.	This kanji depicts the reality TV show where two families <strong>exchange</strong> the <em>two husbands</em> for a <em>day</em> to see how they manage in another family.	Think Brokeback Mountain. The <em>two husbands</em> wish they could<strong> exchange</strong> their dreary, closeted existence for just <em>one day</em> together.

""I<strong> approve</strong> this message""."	A <em>pair of husbands</em> who are married to the same rich woman,<strong> approve</strong> of each other's spendings of the wife's money (<em>shells</em>). Husband nr.1 - “That DVD player and wide-screen HDTV you bought last week, they're awesome!”. Husband nr.2 - “My pleasure. By the way I totally<strong> approve</strong> of that BMW you bought the other day!”.	"Out of two potential <em>husbands</em>, which would mom and dad<strong> approve</strong> of? Well, the one with <em>shells</em> (money) of course!!! (big thanks to zazen here but I keep getting this one confused with <a href=""../v4/1074.html"">choose</a> (#1074 択) later.. So I figure mom and dad would be the ones whose approval we'd like)."	If a married couple were <em>two Homers</em>, they would always<strong> approve</strong> on what to spend their <em>money</em>. (Image: shopping together: New golfclubs? I<strong> approve</strong>! Donuts? I<strong> approve</strong>!).

One of the <em>two husband's</em> first job is to fix the <em>water</em> faucet in his new family's apartment. Unfortunately, he isn't very good at fixing things and after a few failed attempts the entire apartment is <strong>submerged</strong> in <em>water</em>."	When you <em>exchange</em> places with <em>water</em> you become<strong> submerge</strong>d.	After their lovely <em>exchange</em> of vows, the two gay <em>Homer</em> <em>husbands</em><strong> submerge</strong> themselves in the hot tub.	"Fact: To<strong> submerge</strong>, a submarine exchange the content of ballast tanks with either water or air. To<strong> submerge</strong> the air is <em>exchange</em> with <em>water</em>.

失		lose	"""To <b>lose</b>"" here takes the sense of ""misplace,"" not the sense of <i>defeat</i>, whose kanji we learned in frame 67. It pictures a <i>husband</i> with something falling from his side as he is walking along, something he <b>loses</b>."	* As a primitive, this character can also mean to drop.	5	908	845	25	シツ	うしな.う、う.せる	The <em>drop</em> falling here is the <em>husband's</em> toupee… he's already <strong>lost</strong> his hair once, now he's <strong>losing</strong> it again. Such is life, I suppose.	Note: Heisig's stroke order is wrong. It's the same as vermilion, drop first. <em>Homer</em> <strong>loses/drops</strong> his wedding ring.	My husband is going to<strong> lose</strong> his hair, one drop at a time.	Homer's head drops in disappointment when he realizes he lost one of his 2 remaining hairs on his head.	"The <em>husband</em> has <strong>lost</strong> his job ( 失業する ), yet on his way out of the office he bows respectfully one last time (the drop signifying his deep bow), saying ""shitsurei shimasu"" ( 失礼しあす )."		
鉄		iron	Metal . . . to drop.		13	909	846	25	テツ	くろがね	<strong>Iron</strong> is a<em> metal</em> that gradually becomes <em>lost</em> due to oxidation and rust.	"Compare with <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/270"">pig-iron</a> (#270 銑). In moving from <strong>pig-iron</strong> to<strong> iron</strong>, some of the <em>metal's</em> maleability is <em>LOST</em>. (The only difference between the two kanji is that<strong> IRON</strong> has knee-less, unbending legs, while PIG-IRON (270) has very supple, bendable legs.)."	<strong>Iron</strong> man will never lose.	"I accidentally <em>dropped</em> a bucket of molten<strong> iron</strong> on my husband one day at the factory. He died instantly, but I didn't know what to do with his remains. Somehow an art collector heard about my plight and offered me three million in <em>gold</em> for my ""masterpiece"". He called it<strong> Iron</strong> Man. So all because of a bucket of molten<strong> iron</strong>, I gained some <em>gold</em> and <em>lost</em> a husband."	<strong>Iron</strong> weights a lot. It's a metal that's easy to drop.		
迭		alternate	To drop . . . road.		8	910	847	25	テツ		When you get lost, you just take an<strong> alternate</strong> road to get back on track.	When you <em>lose</em> your way, you can always try to tell the wife that you merely took an<strong> alternate</strong> <em>road</em>. To save time you know. I'm not LOST, I'm just taking an<strong> alternate</strong> road. Ahem.	If you take the<strong> alternate</strong> <em>road</em>, trust me you'll get <em>lost</em>.	When your GPS <em>loses</em> the <em>road</em>, it <strong>transfers</strong> to an <strong>alternate</strong> route.	Trying to take an<strong> alternate</strong> road as a shortcut is the best way to… <em>lose</em> you <em>way</em>.		
臣		retainer	"This kanji is actually a pictograph for an eye, distorted to make it appear that the pupil is protruding towards the right. This may not be an easy form to remember, but try this: Draw it once rather large, and notice how moving the two vertical lines on the right as far right as possible gives you the pictograph of the eye in its natural form. The ""pop-eye"" image belongs to an Emperor's <b>retainer</b> standing in awe before his ruler."	* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word becomes <i>slave</i>.	7	911	848	25	シン、ジン		<strong>Retainer</strong>: <em>a servant, especially one who has worked for a person or familly for a long time.</em> Now, if you imagine looking at a<strong> retainer</strong> (e.g. Igor) from top, you see how he is bending his head (middle rectange) between his two shoulders as he offers something with his two hands (upper and lower lines) to his master.	Its a pictograph of a teeth with a<strong> retainer</strong> in the middle.	<strong>Retainer</strong> = A slave (for the purposes of this kanji.) This is a pictograph of a slave collar with two handcuffs dangling from it.	It may be useful to know that 大臣 （だいじん） means Minister.	It's clearly an X-Wing. Piloted as usual by everyone's favourite slave /<strong> retainer</strong>, R2-D2. I'll attempt to use him as a primitive in the following kanji. (He's much easier to use as a primitive because a) he's more loveable than an X-Wing and b) he's always where the action is).

The <em>slaves</em> are to be sold in the store, to differentiate from a warehouse, which doesn't have the word ""store"" in it."	Slaves moved flowers from the<strong> storehouse</strong> in preparation for the parade.	For this story, I have chosen to use <em>overgrown</em> as an enclosure. The <em>slaves</em>, who are treated as objects rather than human beings, are denied the luxury of living in a proper house. Rather, they are stuffed in the <em>overgrown</em> <strong>storehouse</strong> with their owner's other possessions.	Slaves are being paraded, decorated with flowers in a rather ironic attempt of making them look happy in order to attract buyers. After the parade they are put back into the<strong> storehouse</strong>. -<strong> STOREHOUSE</strong> (for temporary preservation), storeroom.

So, when you die, your<strong> entrails</strong> and other body parts will be placed in a storehouse.	Your <em>body</em> is like <em>a storehouse</em> for your<strong> entrails</strong>.	Again with the Pyramids, each Pharaoh had their<strong> entrails</strong> taken out and put into little jars that were shaped in the forms of their Gods and entombed along with the preserved body. So, the<strong> entrails</strong> are the <em>parts of the body</em> that are placed in the <em>storehouse</em> along with the Pharaoh! Damnit, why can't they always be this easy? :(.	Your<strong> entrails</strong> are the storehouse for your body's waste.	Most people don't really like to eat<strong> entrails</strong>…so those <em>pieces of meat</em> just build up in the <em>storehouses</em> over time. (Picture a storehouse bursting at the seams with tripe…).		
賢		intelligent	Slave . . . crotch . . . shellfish.		16	915	852	25	ケン	かしこ.い	An<strong> intelligent</strong> man is neither slave to his crotch nor to money. But an<strong> intelligent</strong> slave will know how to use his/her crotch to make money.	Every<strong> intelligent</strong> man is a <em>slave</em> to two things, his: 1) <em>crotch</em>, and 2) <em>money</em>.	An<strong> intelligent</strong> slave hides shells (money) in his crotch (in the crotch of his buttocks, say) so that one day maybe he can buy his freedom. Note: do not confuse with FRAME 459 “cleverness” (in which Heisig suggested the image of a fox associated with the idea of “alert, quick”). This key word here refers in fact to “wise” but Heisig probably chose<strong> intelligent</strong> to avoid confusion later with “wisdom” (so try to think of<strong> intelligent</strong> in the sense of someone wise).	"Tip: The <em>slave + crotch</em> combination appears five times in Heisig. It may be worth making a new primitive.

If you become a <em>slave</em> to your <em>crotch</em> and play with your <em>flesh</em> every night, that <em>part of your body</em> will think it no longer needs to be used for peeing, and that is how you get<strong> kidney</strong> failure.	Needing more money, the <em>slave</em> sold this <em>body part</em> in addition to her <em>crotch</em>.	The<strong> kidney</strong>s are a filtering system for blood that removes waste and diverts it to the urinary system. In other words,<strong> kidney</strong>s are a <em>part of the body</em> that acts like a <em>retainer</em> for your <em>crotch</em>.		
堅		strict	Slave . . . crotch . . . soil.		12	917	853	25	ケン	かた.い、-がた.い	"The<strong> strict</strong> parent thinks adolescent kids are ""<em>slaves</em> to their <em>crotch</em>"" (= can't control their hormones), so he <em>grounds</em> them. Permanently!"	"<strong>Strict</strong> masters treat even <a href=""../v4/852.html"">intelligent</a> (#852 賢) slaves like dirt, and they get no shells."	I'm very<strong> strict</strong> about not just sleeping with anyone. People who are <em>slaves</em> to their <em>crotches</em> often end up with <em>dirt</em>y genitalia and I don't want to get their VD. (on yomi=ケン).	It's a<strong> strict</strong> place…any <em>slave</em> caught violating rules will be buried up to his <em>crotch</em> in the <em>soil</em>.	The<strong> strict</strong>est of masters took advantage of their <em>slaves' crotches</em>, right there on the <em>soil</em> … the degradation of <em>slave</em>ry at its worst, and most<strong> strict</strong>.		
臨		look to	"<i>Slave</i> . . . <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>goods</i>. The key word suggests both <b>looking</b> ahead <b>to</b> something and ""seeing to"" what is at hand. Consistent with everything we have learned about the role of the key word, this means that you must choose ONE meaning and stick to it."		18	918	854	25	リン	のぞ.む	"The <em>slave</em> is<strong> look to</strong> the future, ""One day"" he thinks ""I will be able to <em>recline</em> with all my <em>goods</em>, a tv, stereo and washing machine, and when that day comes I shall be truly happy"" he sighs."	"Imagine a slave(or in this case, a female porn star) looking to her new gangbang film where she reclines and gets all 3 holes filled at the same………..OK. Very vulgar, but I was inspired by raulir's clever use of ""3 holes""………"	"Roman master to <em>slave</em> - ""I want you to<strong> look to</strong> the <em>goods</em> while I <em>recline</em> on this couch.""."	You better<strong> look to</strong> your <em>slave</em>, he was last seen <em>reclin</em>ing on the <em>goods</em> he's supposed to be loading.	"The <a href=""../v4/852.html"">intelligent</a> (#852 賢) slave is <strong>looking</strong> ahead <strong>to</strong> yet another day of reclining and using all three holes."		
覧		perusal	Slaves . . . reclining . . . floor . . . see.		17	919	855	25	ラン	み.る	The slave reclines on the floor at night to watch the stars. Since that's the only thing the slave is allowed to “read”, he does so very thoroughly and diligently, hence<strong> perusal</strong>.	"[+scottamus] ""Please, come in and <strong>peruse</strong> this fine selection of slaves, all reclining here on the floor for your<strong> perusal</strong>.

"""Please come in and make a<strong> perusal</strong> of all my finest <em>slaves</em> <em>laying</em> on the <em>floor</em>. Tell me if you <em>see</em> anyone you like. For you, I make the best deal.""."	In Japan while out shopping, you will often hear the shop assistant use the phrase ' ご覧ください ' (goran kudasai) which are words to the effect of 'please feel free to browse/take a look'. It is a politer way of asking someone to look than ' 見て ' (mite). In the kanji for<strong> perusal</strong>, we have <em>see</em>, but also the addition of the Japanese sales assistant who acts as your personal <em>slave</em> with their body always <em>inclined</em> to the <em>floor</em> in a bow, marking the more respectful nuance of this kanji..	"[var of romanrozhok's story] This kanji is used for the keigo ご覧になる . A <em>slave</em> comes up to his master who is <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> while his mistresses keep him cool with big leaves. The slave holds a document that has just been completed. As a slave talking to a master, he doesn't just say ""you wanted to <em>see</em> this"" but ""the document is ready for your<strong> perusal</strong>"". In Japanese, he would use "" ご覧になる .""."		
巨		gigantic	"This kanji depicts a <b>gigantic</b> ""pop-eye,"" which accounts for its shape. Be sure not to confuse it with the <i>slave</i> (<i>retainer</i>) we just learned."		5	920	856	25	キョ		This is actually the top view of a porn star with a<strong> gigantic</strong> erect penis. The top and bottom are his arms and the middle is his penis. Imagine him making the pumping motion while he's banging some chick. The arms move in, the penis moves out and vice versa.	The letter E, with a<strong> GIGANTIC</strong> middle stroke.	The <em>slave</em> without his bonds (the missing two strokes) feels<strong> gigantic</strong>.	<strong>Gigantic</strong>… nay, 巨 normous!	You know if this 漢字 was just rotated 90 degrees to left/right, there wouldn't be any stories on this page…		
拒		repel	Fingers . . . gigantic.		8	921	857	25	キョ、ゴ	こば.む	Having <em>gigantic</em> <em>fingers</em> is useful to<strong> repel</strong> insects. You can swat them away a lot easier!	A woman might be<strong> REPEL</strong>LED by a porn star's GIGANTIC penis, so he kindly offers to use his FINGERS instead.	Watching those <em>giant fingers</em> at work cracking lobster, Jerry Seinfeld was<strong> repel</strong>led by his new girlfriend at dinner.	Want to<strong> REPEL</strong> someone? Give em the <em>gigantic finger</em> - your biggest finger, which is your middle one of course! (It's even more memorable if you imagine someone with a grotesquely large middle finger).	"A woman with man's hands is all it takes to<strong> repel</strong> Seinfeld, ""but George, her FIGERS are GIGANTIC""."		
力		power	With a little imagination, one can see a muscle in this simple, two-stroke character meaning <b>power</b>.	* As a primitive, either <i>muscle</i> or <i>power</i> can be used.	2	922	858	25	リョク、リキ、リイ	ちから	"I always refer to the<strong> power</strong> of the <em>KATAKANA ""KA""</em>."	I have a very<strong> power</strong>ful <em>muscle カ</em> in my driveway!	As a primitive, I chose Arnold Schwarzenegger. Picture him saying California with his<strong> power</strong>ful accent (KA-lee-fornia).	The <strong>power</strong> of Goku: <em>KA</em>-mehamehaaaaaaa! (Katakana KA).	You've got to have a lot of<strong> power</strong> to wield a sword with such a small blade (notice how the handle of the sword is about 5 times the size of the little blade on top?).		
男		man	<i>Rice fields</i> . . . <i>power</i>. This character is the gender-specific <b>man</b>, not the generic human <i>person</i> of frame 951.		7	923	859	25	ダン、ナン	おとこ、お	Male is seen here as muscles working in the field, in other words working in the rice fields is the work of the male who are usually stronger. This is more or less the meaning of the original Chinese character.	When it comes to choosing a<strong> MAN</strong>, I prefer <em>brains</em> over <em>muscles</em>.	Men have brains and muscles. And, er, women don't.	A<strong> man</strong> should value his <em>brains</em> over his <em>muscles</em>.	<strong>Male</strong> have more <em>power</em> to work the <em>rice field</em>.		
労		labor	Schoolhouse . . . power.		7	924	860	25	ロウ	ろう.する、いたわ.る、いた.ずき、ねぎら、つか.れる、ねぎら.う	Those jocks who always tried to show their muscles in the schoolhouse are now the ones out there doing manual<strong> labor</strong> jobs while we sit here and learn Japanese. Ha!	At the <em>schoolhouse</em>, the administration develops the children's <em>muscles</em> by making them do manual <strong>labour</strong>.	Hard<strong> labor</strong> is like a <em>schoolhouse</em> for your <em>muscles</em>.	The<strong> labor</strong> laws in Japan are different from America. At public <em>schools</em> you'll see kids cleaning–they're the<strong> labor</strong> force.	Stay in school, kids, if you want the power to avoid a life of hard<strong> labor</strong>.		
募		recruit	Graveyard . . . power.		12	925	861	25	ボ	つの.る	"The necromancer hangs out at the local <em>graveyard</em> and uses his dark <em>powers</em> to<strong> recruit</strong> an army of undead. Emphasize the verb form to keep distinct from the noun <a href=""../v4/1173.html"">cadet</a> (#1173 曹)."	WANTED: Hardworking GRAVEYARD diggers. Must have 6 months experience with POWERFUL muscles as will be working in South Africa burying deceased elephants.	The army starts heavily<strong> recruit</strong>ing a lot of manpower and muscle to replace the many who have been killed and sent to the graveyard.	The best place for the zombie army to<strong> recruit</strong> is the graveyard, where their power in numbers can easily be doubled.	The graveyard does have the power to<strong> recruit</strong> us all.		
劣		inferiority	Few . . . muscles.		6	926	862	25	レツ	おと.る	I have an<strong> inferiority</strong> complex because I have <em>fewer</em> <em>muscles</em> than everyone else at the gym. They all look like <em>Macho Man Randy Savage</em> (power) to me.	I had trouble remembering the relative position of the components, so now I use this story: Even <em>muscular</em> men have<strong> inferiority</strong> if they have <em>few</em> things above their <em>muscles</em> (i.e., brain cells).	I have an<strong> inferiority</strong> complex because I have <em>few muscles</em>! (Image: Arnold laughing at a weakling on the beach with few muscles).	If you like 'Heroes', then imagine Sylar having an<strong> inferiority</strong> complex, because he has a <em>few powers</em> less than Peter Petrelli.	<strong>Inferiority</strong> is felt by those with <em>few muscles</em>.		
功		achievement	Craft . . . power.		5	927	863	25	コウ、ク	いさお	The great <strong>achievement</strong>s of humankind, were <em>crafts</em> completed by <em>muscle power</em>: the pyramids, the Eiffel tower, etc.	All of Arnold Schwarzenegger's<strong> achievement</strong>s started with him <em>crafting</em> his <em>muscles</em>.	"Try adding the phrase: ""What an エカcellent<strong> achievement</strong>!"" to whatever story you come up with."	In WarCRAFT,<strong> ACHIEVEMENT</strong>S were added so POWERful players would have something else to do.	The greatest<strong> achievement</strong> is to bent an <em>I-beam</em> with your own <em>power</em> and muscles.		
勧		persuade	Pegasus . . . power.		13	928	864	25	カン、ケン	すす.める	"Mnemonic ""<em>pegasus</em> <strong>persuasion</strong> <em>power</em>"". I think of the hippogriff from Harry Potter as being like a <em>pegasus</em>. To befriend a hippogriff, you have to<strong> persuade</strong> it you mean no harm, you can do this if you have ""<em>pegasus</em> <strong>persuasion</strong> <em>power</em>""."	"A little girl is trying to<strong> persuade</strong> a little boy to play dolls with her. She offers him her plastic <em>pegasus</em> figure and says, ""See? <em>Pegasus</em> has <em>muscles</em>. He's got <em>Pegasus</em> <em>power</em>."" And the little boy says ""You cannot<strong> persuade</strong> me to play with your flying unicorn. I'm not of that persuasion.""."	Only the <strong>power</strong>ful can<strong> persuade</strong> <strong>Pegasus</strong> to let them ride her.	<em>Pegasus Power?</em> What kind of dorky name for an electric company is that? You'll never ever<strong> persuade</strong> me to invest my money in a company called <em>Pegasus Power</em>.	The crafty <em>Pegasus</em> <strong>persuades</strong> stupid <em>Conan</em> that he, <em>Pegasus</em>, should ride on <em>Conan's</em> back, and not the other way around. Picture it! The power of persuasion…		
努		toil	Guy . . . muscle.		7	929	865	25	ド	つと.める	Guy + Power: To reach a position of power in the company, the average guy has to<strong> toil</strong> very hard for many years.	Attempted rape……a man attemps to use his power to force his crotch into a woman….try to imagine her actually struggling as much as possible (toiling) and putting up a good fight…..also instead of intercourse, you can imagine him trying to force her to give him a blowjob(the crotch next to the woman).	<em>Guys</em> with large <em>muscles</em> usually find themselves <strong>toiling</strong> in dirty, disgusting trenches doing the work more delicately constructed individuals cannot (or will not).	Guy + Power: the average <em>guy</em> has to<strong> toil</strong> very hard for many years in order to reach a position of <em>power</em> in the company.	For the average guy to get muscles he must really<strong> toil</strong> in the gym.		
勃		uprising	"If you think of the <i>ten</i> as a little ""cross"" sitting atop the root of a <i>house</i> where we are used to seeing the ""chimney"" (<i>drop</i>), then you have the image of a <i>chapel</i>. (This combination will appear once more in this book: Frame 1465.) To complete the picture for <b>uprising</b>, add: <i>child</i> . . . <i>muscles</i>."		9	930	2858	25	ボツ、ホツ	おこ.る、にわかに	An<strong> erection</strong> can shoot like a <em>needle</em> from its <em>crown</em> and has the <em>power</em> to make a <em>child</em>.	The<strong> erection</strong> is the crowned needle that's got the power to make children.	(Using both keywords). The <em>child</em> had the <em>power</em> of <em>10 crowns</em> - it was he who led the peasant <strong>uprising</strong>. He didn't even have his first <strong>erection</strong> and yet he was more powerful than all the adults. 勃然 【ぼつぜん】 (adj-t,adv-to) sudden; fit of anger 勃起 【ぼっき】 (n,vs)<strong> erection</strong> (usu. penis); standing erect; stiffening.	"(Using the ""newer"" key word of ""Uprising"" and the 6th edition explanation that the <em>needle/crown</em> combo = ""chapel"") Joan of Arc was just a <em>child</em> under the influence of the <em>chapel</em> when she was inspired with the <em>power</em> to lead the French uprising."	The power of his<strong> erection</strong> crowned him with 10 children.		
励		encourage	Cliff . . . ten thousand . . . power.		7	931	866	25	レイ	はげ.む、はげ.ます	<em>10,000</em> Persians are at the base of the <em>cliff</em>, but the leader of the 300 Spartans just flexes his huge <em>muscles</em> and<strong> encourage</strong>s his men by shouting that they have the <em>power</em> to fight them all.	People<strong> encourage</strong> you, giving you the power so you can dive off the 10,000m high cliff into the sea.	"See the most-starred story in <a href=""../v4/514.html"">horse chestnut</a> (#514 栃) for an easy way to remember this one. –> That same famous <em>cliffside</em> in Japan at which <em>10,000</em> people died … together, we have the <em>power</em> to do something about it … let's<strong> encourage</strong> the government to take action!"	<em>10,000</em> lemmings, an invisible <em>power</em> seems to be encouraging them to dive off the <em>cliff</em>.	All of you on this site<strong> encourage</strong> me so much. Japanese no longer seems like an impossible cliff 10,000 meters high. Thanks to the<strong> encourage</strong>ment I've gotten here, I have the POWER to learn 10,000 Kanji!		
加		add	<i>Muscles</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>. This is the only case in which the primitive for <i>muscle</i> appears on the left; note should be taken of the fact in composing one's story.		5	932	867	25	カ	くわ.える、くわ.わる	If you eat anymore, you will be<strong> add</strong>ing more カロries. (katakana karo).	This is <em>Power Mouth</em>, the most annoying neighbour in the world who always has something to<strong> add</strong>.	To<strong> add</strong> <em>muscle</em> mass it's important to put protein in your <em>mouth</em> after working out.	Some tenis players seem to think that they can<strong> add</strong> <em>power</em> to their shots by opening their <em>mouths</em> and groaning as they hit the ball.	To<strong> add</strong> muscles,<strong> add</strong> some calories (カロリー) to your mouth.		
賀		congratulations	Add . . . shells.		12	933	868	25	ガ		When someone at work gets married, you pass around an envelope to which you <em>add</em> some <em>money</em> and a card which you sign with your<strong> congratulations</strong>.	<strong>Congratulations</strong> are so much better when you <em>add money</em> to them.	I was a bit shocked when I learnt that it's tradition in Japan to <em>add</em> around 30,000 yen (<em>shells</em>) or more to a wedding<strong> congratulations</strong> card.	<strong>Congratulations</strong> on winning the lottery! We'll add the clams (money) to your account.	You like it when shells (money) are added to your “congratulations cards”.		
架		erect	"<i>Add</i> . . . <i>trees</i>. Hint: if you ever <i>played with</i> an ""<b>Erector</b> Set"" or ""Tinker Toys"" as a child, don't pass up the opportunity to relate it to this kanji's key word and the element for <i>trees</i>."		9	934	869	25	カ	か.ける、か.かる	Instant wood. Just add Viagra.	I'm not sure I know about<strong> erect</strong>or sets or tinker toys but I do know about jenga. You play by taking <em>wooden</em> pieces from the middle of a wooden tower and <em>add</em>ing them to the top. In this way you<strong> erect</strong> a very unstable structure.	"Powerfull mouth makes ""tree"" stand<strong> erect</strong>, hmm what does that mean?"	<em>Add wood</em> to<strong> erect</strong> a structure.	To<strong> erect</strong> a building in Warcraft, you just keep <em>adding</em> more <em>wood</em>, until the building is fully<strong> erect</strong>ed.		
脇		armpit	"<i>Part of the body</i> . . . <i>muscles</i> (three of which give us ""<i>triceps</i>"" or ""<i>muscles</i> on top of <i>muscles</i>""). You will want to keep the kanji distinct from the one that follows by paying attention to the positioning of the elements."		10	935	870	25	キョウ	わき、わけ	What <em>part of the body</em> has a <em>very, very, very powerful</em> smell? The<strong> armpit</strong>, of course!	<strong>Armpit</strong> is the <em>flesh</em> near your <em>tri</em>ceps.	"(no important on yomi) The part of Conan's body that is three times more effective at defeating foes than his muscles are his stinky<strong> ARMPIT</strong>s. [Note: Typically, when the flesh primitive is on the left side it refers to a body part - this helps distinguish in from <a href=""../v4/871.html"">threaten</a> (#871 脅)]."	The piece of flesh between the triceps and the deltoid muscle (note how the 3 strengths form a neat delta) is the<strong> armpit</strong>.	The part of the body on your flank, where the triceps is attached, is the<strong> armpit</strong>. Note: the kanji is often used in the sense of “flank” or “side”. The<strong> armpit</strong> is a part of the body on your sides/flanks.		
脅		threaten	Triceps . . . part of the body.		10	936	871	25	キョウ	おびや.かす、おど.す、おど.かす	"Compare the primitive positions of <a href=""../v4/870.html"">armpit</a> (#870 脇) and <a href=""../v4/871.html"">threaten</a> (#871 脅). When your <em>triceps</em> rest alongside your <em>body</em>, they fit snugly against your <strong>armpit</strong>. When you hold them above your <em>body</em>, however, your posture becomes quite<strong> threaten</strong>ing."	Arnold S. (<em>triceps</em>)<strong> threaten</strong>s to kill the waiter if he does not put a steak (<em>meat</em>) infront of him immediately.	"Zelda (NES): Link<strong> THREATEN</strong>S Ganon by lifting the ""TRIforce of POWER"" over his BODY. Then the final battle begins."	Is he really that<strong> THREATEN</strong>ing..? He may have big <em>triceps</em> above, but I bet theres a tiny bit of <em>meat</em> below!	A towering mass of <em>muscles</em> on top of <em>muscles</em> is looming over you, <strong>threatening</strong> to beat you into a bloody pile of <em>meat</em>.		
協		co-	This prefix should be kept distinct from <i>inter</i> (Frame 222) and <i>mutual</i> (Frame 819). Its elements: <i>needle</i> . . . <i>triceps</i>.		8	937	872	25	キョウ		The nurse says : “If you<strong> co-</strong>operate, that <em>needle</em> (syringe) in your <em>triceps</em> won't hurt”. Note: both<strong> co-</strong> and cooperate are meanings for this kanji.	<strong>Co-</strong>operation: 3 persons can have the <em>power</em> of <em>ten</em> if they<strong> co-</strong>operate.	<em>3 times Arnold</em> (Schwazzaneggar) asked his<strong> co-</strong>workers to cooperate and give him a <em>needle</em> (syringe) of steroids (into his tricep), but each time they refused to<strong> co-</strong>ooperate.	"The nurse says: ""If you don't <strong>co-operate</strong> with us and let us stick this <em>needle</em> into your <em>triceps</em>, sir, we'll have to stick it somewhere else! (Thnx Fabrice!)."	If we cooperate, we will have <em>ten</em> times as much <em>power</em> and <em>triceps</em>.		
行		going	By joining the top four strokes, you should get a picture of the front current of a river, the stream trailing behind. Hence the character for <b>going</b>.	* As a primitive, this character has two forms. Reduced to the left side only, it can mean a <i>column</i>, <i>going</i>, or a <i>line</i> of something or other. When the middle is opened up to make room for other elements, it means a <i>boulevard</i>.	6	938	873	25	コウ、ギョウ、アン	い.く、ゆ.く、-ゆ.き、-ゆき、-い.き、-いき、おこな.う、おこ.なう	To me, this looks like a bridge<strong> going</strong> over a body of water, being supported by columns underneath it. Being that I live near the ocean, I see tourists and vacationers coming and<strong> going</strong> constantly on the bridge. Because the bridge is so long, it forms an arc to support the structural integrity. You can see that arc here.	I use <em>The Flash</em> for for this primitive; a superhero who is always <em>going</em> very fast.	See book. * As a primitive I will prefer to use the meaning of column whenever possible, and use the image of columns of the temples of ancient Greece (such as Corinthian columns). The primitive meaning of line is best avoided in my opinion because it is very close to FRAME 812 “file”.<strong> Going</strong> is not very graphic, but may be used when a mnemonic calls for it.	For those who need a mnemonic in order not to forget how to write this kanji, think of katakana イテ <em>ite</em> (here the イeven gets a dot): <em>ite</em> in Latin means <em>go</em>! +++ As for the primitive: I'll use <em>i</em> as in <em>iTunes</em> or <em><strong>i</strong>tinerary</em>.	"I was having a hard time using 'columns' and 'going' for the left-side later on. What helped me was using it as ""crossing the line"". You know, as in ""going too far"". This might help, it did for me."		
律		rhythm	This character depicts a calligrapher's <i>brush</i> and its <b>rhythmic</b> sway as it flows down <i>a column</i> writing kanji on the way.		9	939	874	25	リツ、リチ、レツ		The calligrapher's <em>brush</em> is moving down a <em>column</em> of a script, in<strong> rhythm</strong> with his meditation.	The army COLUMN walked to the<strong> RHYTHM</strong> made by the drummer using a cool BRUSH like drum stick. Picturing the brush as a drum stick is not difficult if you've seen such a thing in jazz videos.	Picture a school of studious calligraphers. All their <em>brushes</em> are moving up and down the <em>columns</em> at the same time, in beautiful<strong> rhythm</strong>.	<em>Brush</em> Hero: The latest in<strong> rhythm</strong> games, you have to use your <em>brush</em> in<strong> rhythm</strong> to the music as the <em>column</em> of strokes move down the screen.	[+woel] <em>Lance Armstrong</em> is riding here while <em>brush</em>ing his teeth. This is actually one of the secrets to his success - he sets his<strong> rhythm</strong> by <em>brush</em>ing his teeth, and following that<strong> rhythm</strong> on the pedals. In-out-in-out-in-out; right-left-right-left-right-left. You can try it sometime if you really want to bring your<strong> rhythm</strong> to a good pace.		
復		restore	Going . . . double back.		12	940	875	25	フク	また	Before <em>going</em> all the way to the Boss in a Final Fantasy game, you should probably <em>double back</em> to save at a<strong> restore</strong> point.	The <em>column</em> of soldiers has to <em>double back</em> to<strong> restore</strong> the peace in the village they just left.	You are writing a complex technical document on your computer when suddenly your computer crashes and your document is lost. You have to<strong> restore</strong> your computer from backups. Your backups are kept in a tall <em>column</em> (spindle) of DVD's. After you finish restoring your computer, you <em>double-back</em> on your train of thought, reconstructing your lost work.	To<strong> restore</strong> order, time travelers <em>double back</em> by <em>going</em> back on the timeline.	A<strong> restore</strong>d column displayed at the Louvres in Paris, makes you double back for another snapshot or another good look at it. Alternatively you may imagine that as part of the restoration of an ancient Greek temple, some columns have been “double backed”.		
得		gain	Column . . . nightbreak . . . glue.		11	941	876	25	トク	え.る、う.る	To<strong> gain</strong> more knowledge of what's goin on in the world I'm reading <em>column</em> after <em>column</em> of articles in the newspapers, and it takes so much time I'm <em>glued</em> to it till <em>nightbreak</em>.	Imagine fat people……they avoid <em>going</em> outside to exercise and stay <em>glued</em> to their TV set until <em>nightbreak</em>….so of course they<strong> gain</strong> weight.	Just to<strong> GAIN</strong> a level in WOW, I will keep <em>GOING</em> until <em>NIGHTBREAK</em> <em>GLUED</em> to my PC.	A COLUMN of soldiers gets up at NIGHTBREAK to chase the enemy whose trail they have remained GLUED to, and thus<strong> GAIN</strong> on them.	To<strong> gain</strong> more knowledge of japanese I'm reading <em>column</em> after <em>column</em> of RTK, and it takes so much time that I'm <em>glued</em> to my SRS until <em>nightbreak</em> (I love you Spidercat).		
従		accompany	Column . . . animal horns . . . mending.		10	942	877	25	ジュウ、ショウ、ジュ	したが.う、したが.える、より	The line of viking soldiers is always accompanied by a horn mending specialist.	"I'm <em>going</em> to<strong> accompany</strong> the <em>horny</em> girl to her room so I can ""mend"" her."	As you're <em>going</em> along someplace, you pause to <em>mend</em> a wounded <em>animal's horns</em>, and it decides to <em>go</em> with you, to<strong> accompany</strong> you as a pet/sidekick, out of gratitude.	Japanese Folklore:———– <em>Mend</em> the <em>Horns</em> of an Oni, and he will<strong> accompany</strong> you on your travels, <em>Going</em> anywhere you choose.	"The symbol on the right works well as Horny Repairman (mender) so you can imagine a porn character like a cable repairman that shows up at the door, and a beautiful girl answers (having seen the Big Lebowski helps with this visual). But instead of coming in, he asks the girl to<strong> accompany</strong> him to his van and she obeys and goes with him. ""obey"" is the primary meaning of this kanji so it's good to work it into the visual."		
徒		junior	Line . . . run.		10	943	878	25	ト	いたずら、あだ	The<strong> junior</strong> employee is always <em>RUNNING</em> around <em>GOING</em> here and there for his superiors.	Your<strong> junior</strong> or Jr. in the succession <em>line</em> is the one who <em>run</em>s after you.	I'm not sure where Heisig gets the<strong> junior</strong> keyword, but this kanji is more often used in the sense of either futile (e.g. 徒労 - fruitless efforts) or group(gang) member (e.g. 聖徒 - disciple, キリスト教徒 - Christian). I'll use gang member for this one. The<strong> junior</strong> <strong>gang member</strong> is going to represent at the running competition.	Little <em>The Flash</em> <strong>junior</strong> likes to <em>run</em> around in his red undies. But he's nowhere near as fast as his dad.	Spartan soldiers raised their <em>junior</em> boys strictly, one of the tests forcing them to <em>run</em> around their impressive <em>columns</em> untill the<strong> junior</strong>s fell to the ground, exhausted and dizzy to the state of nausea.		
待		wait	Line . . . Buddhist temple.		9	944	879	25	タイ	ま.つ、-ま.ち	A <em>line</em> queued up outside the <em>Buddhist temple</em>, <strong>waiting</strong> to see the shrine on New Year's Day.	The COLUMNS of this TEMPLE are a well-know meeting spot. You can always see someone<strong> WAIT</strong>ING there.	According to my japanese teacher the etymology of this kanji is that in ancient japan, when people were going on trips they would<strong> wait</strong> at temples for other people, or to get rest.	<em>The Flash</em> hates <em>Buddhist temples</em> because they always make him sit still and <strong>wait</strong> for prayers to finish. (Image: <em>The Flash</em> sitting in seiza with his legs twitchingly impatiently<strong> wait</strong>ing for prayers to end).	Im GOING to<strong> wait</strong> at the TEMPLE until buddha returns.		
往		journey	<i>Column</i> . . . <i>candlestick</i>. This character has the special sense of <b>journeying</b> to someplace or other.		8	945	880	25	オウ	い.く、いにしえ、さき.に、ゆ.く	In Medieval Japan, <em>going</em> to see your <em>lord</em> was often a long<strong> journey</strong>.	The fellowship of the ring is on a long<strong> journey</strong> through the depths of Khaz Modan. Imagine they walk through the hall of pillars, with only light being from their own candlesticks that. Soon they will meet much more light than they would ever want to…	Parties should stay in a single-file <em>line</em> and carry a <em>candlestick</em> while <strong>journeying</strong> through an unknown dungeon in an RPG.

征		subjugate	Column . . . correct.		8	946	881	25	セイ		America seeks to <em>GO</em> and <em>CORRECT</em> other nations. But really what they do is<strong> subjugate</strong> them…	To<strong> subjugate</strong> is to have somebody stand still and stiff as a column and behave one hundred percent correctly.	<strong>Subjugate</strong>d Samson. Here's the Bible story of Samson after Delilah deceived him into telling her the secret of his strength, his long hair, now shaved and<strong> subjugate</strong>d into submission by the Philistines, chained to the temple <em>columns</em> where he choose to do the <em>correct</em> thing; called upon the God of the Israelites to give him one last burst of power and brought down the entire temple of the Philistines and slew more enemies of Israel in his death than in his life.

径		diameter	Line . . . spool.		8	947	882	25	ケイ	みち、こみち、さしわたし、ただちに	Scientists recently measured the<strong> diameter</strong> of Earth by drilling a deep hole and dropping a <em>line</em> of thread off a humongous <em>spool</em> until it got to the other side.	"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reasons: (1) <em>Toilet paper/roll</em> usually comes on a <em>spool</em>. (2) <em>Toilet paper</em> is used to clean the <em>soil</em> off your <em>crotch</em>. Story: Measure the<strong> diameter</strong> of a <em>column</em> (maybe Nelson's Column in London?) using a roll of <em>toilet paper</em>.

I'm <em>going</em> to measure the<strong> diameter</strong> of your <em>crotch</em>, sorry I know it sounds <em>dirty</em> but its for the good of science!	<em>Lance Armstrong</em> wins because his bike has wheels with a bigger<strong> diameter</strong>. This raises his <em>crotch</em> higher off the <em>ground</em>, giving him more pedalling power. (After winning the Tour de France so many times, the French public liked him almost as much as Princess Di (they use her as the yardstick to measure how much they like celebrities. You could even say that he went up a few notches on the Princess <strong>Di-a-Meter</strong>… (sorry))).	The <em>column</em> of soldiers to the left has been assigned to measure the<strong> diameter</strong> of a bomb crater. They carry a huge <em>spool</em> of measuring tape with them as they march to the other side.		
彼		he	<i>Going</i> . . . <i>pelt</i>. This kanji refers to the third person singular personal pronoun, generally in its masculine form.		8	948	883	25	ヒ	かれ、かの、か.の	What's the main difference between a<strong> he</strong> and a she? The<strong> he</strong> has a <em>column</em> covered in a <em>pelt</em>… a penis. Badum-ching.	The ultimate<strong> he</strong>-man is the Neanderthal cave man. His club is as big as a pillar (<em>column</em>), and<strong> he</strong> wears a ragged <em>pelt</em> as his only clothing. To remember the <em>column</em>, imagine the cave man resting the club vertically like a column when not in use.	Wherever<strong> he</strong> <em>goes</em> //<strong> he</strong> wears <em>pelt</em> clothes.	<strong>He</strong> tough man.<strong> He</strong> wear <em>pelt</em>.<strong> He</strong> go fight <em>column</em> of other<strong> he</strong>-s.	<strong>He-</strong>man fights with <em>The Flash</em> over a fine <em>pelt</em>. Both want to make a new cape for their costume out of it.		
役		duty	Going . . . missile.		7	949	884	25	ヤク、エキ		Japanese kamikaze pilots (and the American from Dr. Strangelove) are so devoted to their<strong> duty</strong> that they <em>go</em> with their <em>missiles</em>.	It is every American citizen's<strong> duty</strong> to <em>GO</em> and fire <em>MISSILES</em> at defenceless countries.	Imagine those poor saps in charge of nuclear silos, responsible for ICBMS, those towering <em>column</em> <em>missiles</em>. When the order comes they must decide whether to obey their concience or do their<strong> duty</strong> and damn the world to atomic annihilation.	GOING and CUMMING is a man's<strong> DUTY</strong>.	It is a soldier's <strong>duty</strong> to maintain a perfectly formed battle <em>column</em>, even when <em>missiles</em> are exploding all around them.		
徳		benevolence	<i>Going</i> . . . <i>needle</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. Refer back now to the note in frame 890.		14	950	885	25	トク		Hearkening back to the kanji for LISTEN…<strong> Benevolence</strong> is a good <em>listener</em> who is willing to <em>go</em> the distance to help.	In a rare act of<strong> benevolence</strong>, the Sparten <em>column</em> removes the needle from the <em>cyclops's</em> eye, and he repays them by eating their <em>hearts</em>.	<strong>Benevolence</strong>: <em>going</em> to help those who are unable to <em>listen</em> (i.e. have no ears).	Darth Vader was put in charge of the<strong> benevolence</strong> fund. He stands holding a bucket with a big heart on it as the column of soilders passes by. Everyone contributes.	A <em>heart</em> which was full of<strong> benevolence</strong>, but so small that it could pass through the <em>eye of a needle</em>, was displayed atop a huge Corinthian <em>column</em> (maybe the relic of some Saint). The <em>column</em> which acted as a stand, reminded viewers not to be fooled by the <em>heart</em>'s <em>needle-eye</em> size.		
徹		penetrate	Line . . . bring up . . . taskmaster.		15	951	886	25	テツ		The <em>taskmistress</em> in a moment of weakness allowed the man's <em>column</em> to<strong> penetrate</strong> her. As punishment he was made to <em>bring up</em> their infant.	Ha! In this frame, a bunch of taskmasters are lined up to<strong> penetrate</strong> the kids they raise/bring up! I'm thinking of some priests and choir boys.	Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to<strong> penetrate</strong> enemy <em>line</em>s (or the <em>columns</em> of soliders). It won't be easy: the soldiers have been <em>brought up</em> since birth, by the <em>taskmaster</em>, to be on guard. To remember <em>brought up</em>, imagine horrible Orcs being created and <em>brought up</em> through black magic and pledging their allegiance to the evil <em>taskmaster</em>. These aren't Orc recruits; these are Orcs that have been created through black magic and <em>brought up</em> to destroy the enemy.	"<strong>Penetrate</strong> = ""<strong>goes</strong> into."" As in the lessons of the taskmaster penetrating the minds of those he his bringing up."	"Compare the two kanji for 'penetrate' and 'remove': here, the child who wasn't <em>raised / brought up</em> with very good manners is <em>going</em> to give his taskmaster a big <em>kancho</em>. After he is<strong> penetrate</strong>d, his angry parents tell him to <a href=""../v4/760.html"">remove</a> (#760 撤) his finger.

徴		indications	Line . . . mountain . . . king . . . taskmaster.		14	952	887	25	チョウ、チ	しるし	If you see a <em>column</em> of <em>kings</em> being marched up the <em>mountain</em> under a <em>taskmaster</em>'s whip…<strong> indications</strong> are, there has been a coup.	The combination of <em>column</em> + <em>mountain</em> + <em>taskmaster</em> appear in quite a few kanji ( 徴 , 微 ,薇,黴), so let's give it the meaning of '<em>trek</em>'. Story: If you see kings trekking like peasants,<strong> indications</strong> are they've been outcast.	This kanji actually means <strong>symbol</strong>. GO to the MOUNTAIN of the KINGS and find a TASKMISTRESS with the <strong>symbol</strong> (of the devil on her forehead)!!	If your going through the hall of the mountain king, and you hear the music speeding up,<strong> indications</strong> are that the taskmaster is coming to get you… Thanks nest0r.	All<strong> indications</strong> are that <em>The Flash</em> and the <em>taskmaster</em> have cornered the <em>king</em> under a <em>mountain</em>!		
懲		penal	Indications . . . heart.		18	953	888	25	チョウ	こ.りる、こ.らす、こ.らしめる	"<strong>Penal</strong> servitude is served until indications show that one has had a change of heart (learned one's lesson). Easily confused with <a href=""../v4/679.html"">punish</a> (#679 刑) and <a href=""../v4/833.html"">penalty</a> (#833 罰). Concentrate on the reasons behind the<strong> penal</strong> system (""changing people's hearts"" here), instead of the<strong> penal</strong>ty itself or the punishment (revenge) aspect. It may help to note that there's no sword, but a heart :-) (Note: 懲りる = learn from one's bad experiences)."	Judge: You will serve a<strong> penal</strong> sentence until <em>indications</em> show you have a <em>heart</em>.	"<strong>Penal</strong> servitude is served until <em>indications</em> show that one has had a change of <em>heart</em>. In other words, when your <em>i</em><strong>Indications</strong> changes from ""I""M A BADASS <em>MOUNTAIN KING TASKMASTER</em>"" to ""I <em>heart</em> the world""."	The <em>indications</em> of a good <em>heart</em> are what is required to get you out of the<strong> penal</strong> system.	<strong>Penal</strong> servitude is served until <em>indications</em> show that one has had a change of <em>heart</em>. Remember in <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, Morgan Freeman wasn't released on parole until he had such a change of heart.		
微		delicate	Line . . . mountain . . . ceiling . . . human legs . . . taskmaster.		13	954	889	25	ビ	かす.か	The Column of 300 spartans were in a<strong> delicate</strong> situation. They had travelled in one line (using only their legs) to the mountain pass to face the fierce Persian task master.	We're <em>going</em> up the <em>mountain</em> announces the <em>taskmaster</em>. Anyone with <em>legs</em> too<strong> delicate</strong> must stay behind.	[The sense of<strong> delicate</strong> implied by this Kanj – easily broken, weak, brittle, insignificant] A <em>column</em> of <em>taskmasters</em> is trying to <em>leg</em>-press <em>one</em> <em>mountain</em> between them. They are old and frail, and their legs skinny and<strong> delicate</strong>. A <em>single</em> pair of <em>legs</em> wouldn't be able to achive anything in this case. However, together they manage to push the <em>mountain</em> up towards the sky.	Here we have a taskmaster who orders a <strong>mountain</strong> to <strong>go</strong> away. The mountain is so frightened that it sprouts two little<strong> delicate</strong> <strong>legs</strong> and gingerly walks away. Be sure to imagine the legs as really tiny and the mountain as really big so the<strong> delicate</strong>-ness is there.	The fellowship of the ring had to move as a <em>column</em> <strong>delicate</strong>ly through the mines of moria. The <em>mountain</em> was above them with <em>legs</em> hanging from the <em>ceiling</em>, no doubt left there by the <em>taskmaster</em> they didn't want to awaken.		
街		boulevard	This is the character from which the sense of <b>boulevard</b> mentioned in frame 938 derives. Its elements: <i>boulevard</i> . . . <i>ivy</i>.		12	955	890	25	ガイ、カイ	まち	The<strong> boulevard</strong> of<strong> boulevard</strong>s, the <em>Champs Elysées</em>, with the Arc de Triomphe covered in <em>ivy</em> to give the champions a heroes' welcome.	Specifically… <em>ivy</em><strong> boulevard</strong>… think hollywood & vine.	"Mnemonic trick : the ""Harvard<strong> Boulevard</strong>"" is covered withf <em>ivy</em> (just like Harvard University)."	A<strong> boulevard</strong> is <em>one street</em> where they use <em>columns</em> of <em>ivy</em> for decorations.	This is a pictograph of an ancient<strong> boulevard</strong>, so long disused that it is now covered in <em>ivy</em> all down the middle.		
桁		girder	Tree . . . going.		10	956	2483	25	コウ	けた	"When the <em>wooden</em> <strong>girders</strong> start to snap, the workmen shout ""Run! Let's <em>go!</em>""."	<strong>Girder</strong>s are support beams that are nowadays mostly made out of steel. But in the ancient houses that are placed at the <em>boulevard</em> the<strong> girder</strong>s will be made out of <em>wood</em>.	「けた」。This kanji is used to denote a number of digits or decimal places, e.g. 三桁のパスワード (a 3-digit password).	People use<strong> girder</strong>s these days – <em>wood's going</em> out.	[+astridtops]<strong> Girder</strong>s are support beams now most often made of steel. But the <strong>girders</strong> of the ancient houses of this <em>boulevard</em> are strong <em>columns</em> of <em>wood</em>.		
衡		equilibrium	Boulevard . . . bound up . . . brains . . . St. Bernard dog.		16	957	891	25	コウ		To maintain the social<strong> equilibrium</strong> in a future dystopian society, the <em>brains</em> of citizens are <em>bound up</em> (hypnotized). The government is using mental wave emitting statues shaped like <em>St. Bernard's dogs</em> put alongside the <em>boulevards</em>.	I think BALANCE is an easier keyword. I was walking down a busy French <em>boulevard</em> when between the rushing traffic I saw the wierdest thing. BALANCING on the central crash barrier was a <em>St. Bernard dog</em>, BALANCING a <em>fish</em> on its nose. As I looked closer, I realised it was a trick; it was holding the fish's tail in its teeth, and only pretending to BALANCE it. (keeps the position of the elements!).	[<em>boulevard</em>… <em>bound up</em>… <em>rice field</em>… <em>large</em>…] imagine a <em>fish</em> walking a <em>boulevard</em> trying to maintain<strong> equilibrium</strong> having had its fins cut off and replaced by a <em>st. bernard</em>.	The poor <em>St. Bernard</em> walking down the middle of the <em>boulevard</em> cannot see to mantain his <strong>equilibrium</strong>. It seems his <em>brain</em> is all <em>bound up</em> with alcohol.	If you've ever seen the movie<strong> Equilibrium</strong>, you know this kanji has it all. Bound minds, dogs, and building shaped like long columns enveloped by endless boulevards of soldiered surveillance. Add some imaginary gun katas and you've got a lawsuit on your hands. If you've never seen this movie, do, or…. CrazyWashu uses the field of<strong> equilibrium</strong> generated between Azaka and Kamidake to create a hybrid fish dog.		
稿		draft	The key word connotes the preliminary composition of a plan or manuscript. Its elements: <i>wheat</i> . . . <i>tall</i>.		15	958	892	26	コウ	わら、したがき	Aliens often<strong> draft</strong> their plans for invasion by cutting designs among the <em>tall</em> <em>wheat</em>.	"The first<strong> DRAFT</strong> of catcher in the rye was actually called ""catcher in the TALL WHEAT""…good thing they changed it. I read it in 高校 ."	<strong>Draft</strong> <em>wheat</em> beer (Hefeweizen) is served in the typical <em>tall</em> German glass.	They tried to<strong> draft</strong> a plan to make the <em>wheat</em> grow <em>tall</em>.	The writer hid himself in the middle of <em>tall wheat</em> so he would not be disturbed while writing the<strong> draft</strong>.		
稼		earnings	Wheat . . . house.		15	959	893	26	カ	かせ.ぐ	Your <strong>earnings</strong> allow you to bring <em>home</em> your daily bread (made of <em>wheat</em>, naturally).	"Hmm,<strong> EARNINGS</strong>. Think of the popular saying ""Bringing HOME the bacon"". Here,<strong> EARNINGS</strong> is the picture ""Bringing HOME the bread(WHEAT) and the bacon (PIG)."	A farmer's<strong> earnings</strong> can be viewed as the amount of wheat he has in his grain silo (house).	<strong>Earnings</strong>? Where I'm from, it's called bringing <em>home</em> the <em>dough</em>…	The breadwinner (<em>wheat</em> bread winner) brings <em>home</em> the<strong> earnings</strong>.		
程		extent	<i>Wheat</i> . . . <i>display</i>. Do not confuse with <i>extremity</i> (Frame 230) or <i>boundary</i> (Frame 523).		12	960	894	26	テイ	ほど、-ほど	The<strong> extent</strong> to which some people will go to create '<em>wheat displays</em>', or as some call them 'crop circles', is truly amazing.	The <em>wheat</em> crop has come in, and the mouth of the king is gobbling it all up. Everyone is waiting to see… to what<strong> extent</strong> will the king manage to eat it this year?	"The<strong> extent</strong> of the <em>wheat display</em> (an ostentatious olympic opening-style event held at harvest time) will show you how profitable a year the kingdoms farmers had. ""Ooo, pretty, wheat fireworks! Must have been a good year!""."	The<strong> extent</strong> to which the <em>king</em> can open his <em>mouth</em> to fit in <em>wheat</em> is really astounding.	The ostentatious wheat display shows the<strong> extent</strong> of the king's wealth.		
税		tax	Wheat . . . devil.		12	961	895	26	ゼイ		Nobody likes the<strong> tax</strong> man, so here it is only fitting that the person who comes over to take some of your <em>wheat</em> is depicted here as a devil. Keep in mind that in feudal societies there was no kind of money to speak of, so<strong> tax</strong>es were paid by serfs in <em>wheat</em> to the <em>devils</em> who came over to keep them poor.	This is an easy one.<strong> Tax</strong>es is like the devil taking away your hard earned wheat.	I don't know if it makes sense, but it works for me: If the Warrior cannot levy the shells [frame 378], then the Devil will come and colllect your Wheat as<strong> Tax</strong>.	"""No, mister<strong> tax</strong> man, please no! Anything but this! Please don't take our <em>bread</em> away! how shall I feed my <em>horny teenager</em> now?""."	When the church takes 10% of your <em>wheat</em> harvest, it's a tithe. When the <em>devil</em> takes it, it's a<strong> tax</strong>.		
稚		immature	Wheat . . . turkey.		13	962	896	26	チ、ジ	いとけない、おさない、おくて、おでる	<strong>Immature</strong> <em>turkeys</em> are stuffed with <em>wheat</em> to make it look bigger.	I can't believe I brought you to the fanciest restaurant in town and you asked for <em>turkey</em> on <em>wheat</em>…how<strong> immature</strong> is that?!	It's<strong> immature</strong> to whip <strong>turkeys</strong> with <strong>wheat</strong>.	The only <em>wheat</em> that a <em>turkey</em> is able to reach for eating is<strong> immature</strong> and shouldn't be touched. Wheat that is ready for harvest is as tall as a human. Shoo the turkeys away from the fields! Gobble gobble! (I guess there's no crows in Japan?).	Wheat + Turkey: This is NOT Fresh (Fish + Sheep). Wheat and turkeys have to mature before they are harvested - both are not very good when they are<strong> immature</strong>.		
和		harmony	Wheat . . . mouth.		8	963	897	26	ワ、オ、カ	やわ.らぐ、やわ.らげる、なご.む、なご.やか	The first step to<strong> harmony</strong> is having enough <em>wheat</em> to feed every <em>mouth</em> in the world. Once we are all fed it is easier to get a long in<strong> harmony</strong>.	People who live in<strong> harmony</strong> with nature live in the country. they are yokels or hillbillys. See Billy-bob sitting on the porch in their denhim dungarees a sheaf of <em>wheat</em>, sticking from their <em>mouth</em>.	What better image of<strong> harmony</strong> and peace than relaxing amidst the wheat, with one long stalk in your mouth.	A cereal commercial. Look at the family so happy in<strong> harmony</strong>. You know its true. Early in the morning you feel like smiling at each other, and being very happy while you eat that cereal…. not… I wake up, shuve it in my mouth and off i am.	Tasty <em>wheat</em> brings true<strong> harmony</strong> to the <em>mouth</em>.		
移		shift	Wheat . . . many.		11	964	898	26	イ	うつ.る、うつ.す	Picture the WHEAT field, filled with MANY, MANY stalks of WHEAT. Notice how they<strong> SHIFT</strong> like waves in the slightest breeze. When you hear<strong> SHIFT</strong>, just picture that scene.	<em>Many</em> people are making the<strong> shift</strong> from white to whole <em>wheat</em> bread.	"To hide the <em>wheat</em> from the devilish <a href=""../v4/895.html"">tax</a> (#895 税) collector, the villagers<strong> shift</strong> the wheat between them <em>many</em>, <em>many</em> times. ""We don't have much, sir, but we'll do anything for the crown""."	I have to work <em>two</em> EVENING <strong>shifts</strong> a week just to be able to put WHEAT on the table. Damn recession.	As Japan became westernized, eating habits changed. Lots of people<strong> shift</strong>ed from rice to <em>bread</em>…<em>many, many</em> loaves of *bread.		
秒		second	The reference here is to a <b>second</b> of time. The elements: <i>wheat</i> . . . <i>few</i>.		9	965	899	26	ビョウ		An hourglass filled with <em>wheat</em> counts time. A <em>few</em> <em>wheat seeds</em> drop every<strong> second</strong>.	I'll be with you soon… please wheat a few<strong> second</strong>s.	I first came across this kanji on my microwave, so; if you want to microwave <em>wheat</em>, it's important to remember only to set it for a <em>few</em><strong> second</strong>s. If it helps you can picture those wheat/bran bag things that you heat in the microwave and apply to muscle aches.	<em>Wheat</em> can be cooked in <em>a few</em> <strong>seconds</strong>.	[thanks, vosmiura] An hourglass filled with <em>wheat</em> counts time. A <em>few</em> <em>wheat grains</em> drop every<strong> second</strong>. Why wheat, not rice? Because wheat grains are yellow, just like the sand in a regular hourglass.		
秋		autumn	Wheat . . . fire.		9	966	900	26	シュウ	あき、とき	In<strong> AUTUMN</strong>, the WHEAT looks the color of FIRE, meaning it's time to harvest it.	Every<strong> autumn</strong> the wheat is set on fire to clear the way for next year's crop…	After the <em>wheat</em> harvest, the farmers have a <em>bonfire</em> to celebrate the<strong> autumn</strong> season.	Every<strong> autumn</strong> they gather in the <em>wheat</em> and then set it all a<em>fire</em>. I don't think they know what they're doing.	"Have a look at this guy's photo if you need a mental image. Compare it to the pic before it to see how drastically the colour changes. <a href=""http://www.panoramio.com/photo/572483"">http://www.panoramio.com/photo/572483</a> Story: <em>Wheat</em> fields are the colour of <em>fire</em> in<strong> Autumn</strong>."		
愁		distress	Autumn . . . heart.		13	967	901	26	シュウ	うれ.える、うれ.い	In AUTUMN, the farmer's HEART is in<strong> DISTRESS</strong> as to if he has enough crops. Even better, the farmer will experience great<strong> DISTRESS</strong> in his HEART if his WHEAT catches FIRE!	"Here we have<strong> distress</strong>ed (think ""gloomy"") people with ""seasonal mood disorder"" during the autumn season. Hence ""autumn heart"" is<strong> distress</strong>ed (gloomy)."	The HEART becomes<strong> distress</strong>ed in the AUTUMN when summer loves end.	The damsel in<strong> distress</strong> was tied to a big stalk of <em>wheat</em> in the middle of a field.. The evil, dastardly villain then set the field on <em>fire</em>! Can our hero get to her in time, saving her life and winning her <em>heart</em>?? Tune in next week!	"I have to imagine a ""damsel in<strong> distress</strong>"" to avoid confusing this with similar keywords. Think of Rapunzel sitting in her tower staring out at the <em>autumn</em> scenery, her <em>heart</em> aching."		
私		private	<i>Wheat</i> . . . <i>elbow</i>. Like the characters for I (Frame 17) and <i>ego</i> (Frame 690), this kanji is also representative of the subject, with the special connotation of <b>privacy</b>.		7	968	902	26	シ	わたくし、わたし	"Warning sign: ""Private wheat, trespassers will be elbowed""."	"A joke so bad as ""wheatashi wa"" deserves an elbow in the<strong> private</strong> parts."	"I already know this as watashi, or ""I"". In order to associate the keyword of<strong> private</strong>, I'll think of this one as ""Private I"", like a detective."	Wheatashi wa.	"I was glad that nobody was around when I stuck my <em>elbow</em> in my <em>cereal</em> bowl and spilled the whole damned mess all over myself. Something that stupid should remain<strong> private</strong> – between ""me, myself, and I""."		
秩		regularity	Wheat . . . drop.		10	969	903	26	チツ		Think of<strong> REGULARITY</strong> in terms of bowel movements. Enough WHEAT in your diet will help your DROPS with improved<strong> REGULARITY</strong>.	Eating plenty of <em>wheat</em> will improve<strong> regularity</strong> and help you <em>lose</em> weight.	I got it.<strong> Regularity</strong>, order, system, systematic. Now, Imagine the husband (the 'head' of the household, the farmer and what not). Walking across his farm, then in a regular, ordered, and systemised fashion he DROPS (the drop) a little piece of wheat. I love this image not only because it answers the keyword, but it is really close to the meaning of the actual kanji.	Increase your<strong> regularity</strong> by eating <em>wheat</em>-bran <em>cereal</em> to improve the<strong> regularity</strong> of your <em>drops</em> in the bathroom.	Farmers deal with <em>losing</em> some of their <em>wheat</em> as a <strong>regularity</strong>.		
秘		secret	Cereal . . . invariably.		10	970	904	26	ヒ	ひ.める、ひそ.か、かく.す	The prize at the bottom of a <em>cereal</em> box is <em>invariably</em> a<strong> secret</strong> decoder ring.	"A young couple meets in<strong> secret</strong> in the <em>wheat</em> field because their families are enemies. They <em>cross their hearts</em> and swear eternal - even if<strong> secret</strong> - love. Do not confuse with <a href=""../v4/775.html"">secrecy</a> (#775 密)."	The farmers <em>invariably</em> keep the actual amount of <em>wheat</em> produced a<strong> secret</strong> from the tax assessor.	My diet<strong> secret</strong>: <em>bread invariably</em> makes you fat.	"NOTE: <a href=""../v4/775.html"">secrecy</a> (#775 密) and<strong> secret</strong> both have the same <em>invariable</em>/[<em>cross my heart</em>]. // But ""<strong>secreC</strong><em><strong>Y</strong></em>"" <strong>C</strong>ontains <em><strong>Y</strong>ama</em>. // and <strong>secre</strong><em><strong>T</strong></em> has <em>whea</em><em><strong>T</strong></em> hidden in it. // <strong>ヒ mi4 비 (bi)</strong>."		
称		appellation	Wheat . . . reclining . . . little.		10	971	905	26	ショウ	たた.える、とな.える、あ.げる、かな.う、はか.り、はか.る、ほめ.る	Taking<strong> appellation</strong> to mean the act of naming, we have the <em>little</em> baby superman <em>reclining</em> in the space craft that landed in a <em>wheat</em> field. Mr. and Mrs. Kent look down and decide to call him Clark. (I also thought of Jesus but he was born in a barn full of hay not wheat).	"<em>WHEAT</em> that is <em>RECLINING</em> and <em>LITTLE</em> (<em>small</em>) can't get the <em>APPELLATION</em> ""quality wheat""."	An Indian chief explains the art of<strong> appellation</strong> by introducing his three children: Swaying <em>Wheat</em>, <em>Reclining</em> Buffalo and <em>Little</em> Bear.	"The way this <em>wheat</em> <em>reclines</em> a <em>little</em> justifies its<strong> appellation</strong>: ""lazy wheat""."	If you're having trouble thinking of a name for your little one, go lie down in a field of wheat for a while and gaze at the stars.		
利		profit	<i>Wheat</i> . . . <i>saber</i>. Be careful not to confuse with <i>gain</i> (Frame 941) or <i>earnings</i> (Frame 959).		7	972	906	26	リ	き.く	1. Steal a bunch of wheat from a wheat field by cutting it down with your saber. 2. ????? 3.<strong> Profit</strong>!	In the middle ages there where only 2 ways for peasantry to make a<strong> profit</strong>. one by being a farmer, 2 to be a mercenary and live by the way of the sword.	Use the saber to cut the wheat and get your<strong> profit</strong>.	"Your <a href=""../v4/893.html"">earnings</a> (#893 稼) are divided between the tax man's share and your<strong> profit</strong> using a saber, which by the way is a cavalry sword, wielded by the <a href=""../v4/895.html"">tax</a> (#895 税) man on his pale horse (not pictured)."	The Legend of Zelda players know that you will<strong> profit</strong> from going into fields of <em>wheat</em> and cutting them down with your <em>saber</em>.		
梨		pear tree	Profit . . . tree.		11	973	907	26	リ	なし	The Japanese<strong> pear tree</strong> is the most profitable in the world, because it produces its fruit in pairs [sorry for the awful pun].	And a <em>profit</em> in a pear <em>tree</em>…12 days of christmas.	The <em>profit</em> on Japanese<strong> pear tree</strong>s is next to なし! (get it?).	During the 12 days of Christmas, the person who made the most <em>profit</em> was the <em>tree</em> salesman, since he sold 12 partriges in a<strong> pear tree</strong>.	"Japanese pears (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_pyrifolia"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_pyrifolia</a>) are very tasty fruits and frequently used as a gift in Japan.

穂		ear of a plant	Wheat . . . favor.		15	975	909	26	スイ	ほ	The pilgrims only had <em>wheat</em>, so they asked the Indians to do them a <em>favor</em> and trade them for some <strong>ears</strong> of corn.	"The ""ear of a plant"" is the seed-bearing spike of a cereal plant, such as corn. In other words, it is the part which feeds us. Hence – ""the<strong> ear</strong> (of a plant) is the <em>favor</em> of the <em>wheat</em>""."	"Botanist (lecturing to class): "". . . and this is the <strong>ear of the plant</strong>."" <em>Wheat</em> plant: ""Will you do me a <em>favor</em> and stop shouting in my<strong> ear</strong>!""."	"The<strong> ear</strong> of corn fell into the dirt. It shouted to the nearby <em>wheat</em>- ""Hey! HEY! Could you do me a <em>favor</em>?!"" No answer… stupid stuck up wheat."	Wheat; favour. The<strong> ear</strong> of the plant is nature's favour.		
稲		rice plant	Wheat . . . vulture . . . olden times.		14	976	910	26	トウ、テ	いね、いな-	The<strong> rice plant</strong> is common in Japan because all the <em>wheat</em> was eaten by <em>vultures</em> in the <em>olden times</em>.	It used to be that <em>wheat</em> was grown in Japan. However, this was often stolen by <em>vultures</em>, so in <em>olden times</em>, the gods gave the Japanese the<strong> rice plant</strong>.	The<strong> rice plant</strong> evolved from wheat in olden times to defend itself against vultures eating it - rice causes vultures to explode.	Wheat has been trying to claw its way in to japan since olden times but the<strong> rice plant</strong> still domiantes the landscape.	What we are calling wheat really refers to a<strong> rice plant</strong>, known to Wolverine from olden times (Wolverine is a lot older than he looks – he was born in the 1880s). Imagine Wolverine in ancient times (mukashi mukashi) planting rice by poking a little hole with his claws and then settling the plant into the mud.

The weird thing is that it burns from the bottom upwards, hanging in the air as if my magic. Try it and see!	When the <em>sun</em> burns the <em>wheat</em> a smell of<strong> incense</strong> remains in the air.	If we would throw a huge amount of wheat on top of the sun, would it become a galactic<strong> incense</strong>? Maybe then aliens wouls come more often, enjoying the<strong> incense</strong>.	When the <em>Sun</em> goes down, the pagans light their <em>wheat</em>, producing a natural<strong> incense</strong>, to honour the <em>Sun</em> God.	<strong>Incense</strong> is commonly used in worship and at shrines in Japan. On <em>sun</em>( 日 )<em>days</em>( 日 ), many people used to go to their shrine of choice, probably that of the SUN goddess Amaterasu, and place a small gift of<strong> incense</strong> and <em>wheat</em> at the foot of the shrine, wishing for a profitable harvest.		
季		seasons	Wheat . . . child.		8	978	912	26	キ		There's a season for planting wheat and there's mating season for having children.	As the<strong> seasons</strong> pass, the <em>wheat</em> and the <em>children</em> grow, but the wheat grows faster, right over the children.	"Look at this adorable <em>child</em> with a bale of <em>wheat</em> on his head! He's playing Autumn in his school play the ""Four<strong> Seasons</strong>"". Aww…too cute! Perhaps we should light the wheat on fire to complete his Autumn costume. (I know, twisted…but I kept forgetting what was on his head)."	When the <em>wheat</em> has grown so high that the farmer can't see his <em>child</em> playing in the field anymore (child under wheat) he knows that the <strong>season</strong> has come to harvest his crops.	According to Greek mythology, the <strong>seasons</strong> are a result of the <em>wheat</em> goddess's (Demeter) <em>child</em> (Persephone) having been kidnapped by Hades.

"The 'straw woman' (woman figure stuffed with wheat) is put on the<strong> committee</strong> to make it look as if there is equal representation, but really it's just a bunch of men (""keeping the women down"" for placement)."

米		rice	This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of <b>rice</b> lying on a plate in the shape of a star.	* As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of <i>rice</i>, and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for <i>wheat</i> that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of <i>rice</i> far exceeds that of <i>wheat</i>.) It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to <i>grains of rice</i>. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for <i>water</i>. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, <i>grains of rice</i> has 5 strokes, while <i>water</i> only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for <i>rice</i> is an abbreviation used for the <i>United States</i>, which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish.	6	987	919	26	ベイ、マイ、メエトル	こめ、よね	Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the<strong> rice</strong>. The rest then is the “tree” meaning “plant” in this contexct. also: USA.	Two <em>drops</em> of<strong> rice</strong> in a <em>tree</em>, simple.	88! Japanese people think of this Kanji as 88. Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods inside. Anyway, that is the origins of this kanji. It's easy to remember: Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods. 八十八 written as one character. just remember one 八 is upside down.	"Avoid <em>rice-grains</em> in stories that use the full 6-stroke 米 , use cups of<strong> rice</strong> instead.

Various types of food are enumerated on the <em>page</em> (maybe a menu): in the upper half you see vegetarian <strong>sorts</strong> of food (such as <em>rice</em>), and in the lower half you see <strong>sorts</strong> of meat dishes (such as <em>St. Bernard dog</em>'s meat).	There are many<strong> sort</strong>s of <em>rice</em> in Japan. Some are as <em>big</em> as your <em>head</em>!		
漆		lacquer	Water . . . tree . . . umbrella . . . grains of rice.		14	1001	932	26	シツ	うるし	<strong>LACQUER</strong> is a type of WATERY type of liquid used to protect items made from TREES, sort of an UMBRELLA of protection. So protective, you can carry around RICE in the<strong> LACQUER</strong>ED, WOODEN product.	<em>Water</em> is falling from a <em>tree</em> onto the <em>umbrella</em> underneath which is protecting the <em>rice</em> underneath it. But it's completely dry since the umbrella is<strong> lacquer</strong>ed.	Water falls from the trees onto my<strong> lacquer</strong> umbrella and bounces and beads off like grains of rice.	Rain <em>drops</em> bounce off<strong> lacquer</strong>ed <em>wood</em> like an <em>umbrella</em> having <em>grains of rice</em> poured on it.	<strong>LACQUER</strong> protects your WOODEN products from WATER like an UMBRELLA–the rain will just bounce off of it like RICE.		
膝		knee	Flesh . . . tree . . . umbrella . . . rice grains.		13	1002	2461	26	シツ	ひざ	"Before <a href=""../v4/932.html"">lacquer</a> (#932 漆) was made with water, it was made by draining this <em>body part</em> of fluid: the<strong> knee</strong>!"	Back in ancient Japan, people didn't have<strong> knee</strong> pads for things like rollerblading and such (what, come on. Ninjas on rollerblades. Ultimate 90s flashback). Instead, they would simply dip their <strong>knee</strong>s in <em>laquer</em>, and wait until it dried (hence the <em>flesh</em>, and the abscence of any <em>drops of water</em>). Unfortunately, this meant that you would have to wait about 30 minutes after deciding to go rollerblade until you could actually do it (took some time to dry) - and removing it was a serious pain.	The <strong>knee</strong>s are the <em>part of the body</em> that I protect with <em>lacquer</em>ed<strong> knee</strong>pads.	Don't<strong> knee</strong>l on the wet lacquer. When it dries your flesh will be stuck to it!	I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took and arrow in the<strong> knee</strong>. Now I have to wear a lacquered<strong> knee</strong> brace to protect my wounded flesh.		
様		Esq.	The abbreviation <b>Esq.</b> will help associate this character with the honorific form of address to which it belongs. Its elements are: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>sheep</i> . . . <i>grains of rice</i>. Note that the final vertical stroke in the element for <i>sheep</i> is extended to form the first stroke for <i>grains of rice</i>.		14	1003	933	26	ヨウ、ショウ	さま、さん	Here we have the requirements to be counted among the ranks of the noble<strong> Esq.</strong> You must posses a <em>forested</em> estate, herds of <em>sheep</em>, and granary full of <em>grains of rice</em>.	This is <strong>-Sama</strong>, a generic high term of respect for someone in an unusual profession. If you met a person that created a <em>wooden</em> <em>sheep</em> that was squeezing a single <em>grain of rice</em> out of its ass, you'd definitely call that person <strong>-sama</strong>. Because that is impressive.	A squire's (Esq.) job is to get his knight 3 things: weapons, women, and food. In this case a really bad squire brings back a piece of wood, a sheep, and a few grains of rice.	This kanji actually means <strong>-sama</strong>. You are the creator of TREES, SHEEP, and RICE?! Ooooh great creator<strong>-SAMA</strong>!! (kneels).	In Japan, your <strong>sama</strong>-ness is determined by how many <em>trees, sheep, and grains of rice</em> you have.		
求		request	Let the <i>drop</i> in the upper right-hand corner of this character close the right angle off to make an <i>arrowhead</i>. Whenever we find the <i>needle</i> with that <i>drop</i> in an element that has no other special meaning, we will take advantage of this primitive meaning. At the bottom, we see the <i>grains of rice</i>, the vertical line doubling up for the two elements. Do not confuse with <i>petition</i> (Frame 143).		7	1004	934	26	キュウ、グ	もと.める	"Enemy: ""Any final<strong> request</strong>s?"" // MacGyver: ""Just an <em>arrowhead</em> and some <em>grains of rice</em>."" (MacGyver then throws the <em>grains of rice</em> at the enemy and uses the <em>arrowhead</em> to cut his hands free from the rope.)."	<em>Robin Hood</em> holds his rich victim at <em>arrowpoint</em> and kindly <strong>request</strong>s that he hands over his <em>grains of rice</em>.	"A beggar asks for you if you can spare a few grains of rice, after you refuse you find him pointing an arrowhead at your throat. ""That wasn't a<strong> request</strong>.""."	"For reasons I'll leave up to you, a monk is being put to death. ""Any last<strong> REQUEST</strong>S?"" they asked him, as they began to squirt <em>drops</em> of poison from a <em>needle</em> into the <em>water</em> of his intravenous line. Yet he said nothing, only concentrating on 求道 , <strong>seeking</strong> the path to enlightenment. (PLEASE note that the 部首 for this character is ""shitamizu"" - NOT rice, but <em>water</em>. Also, the keyword ""seek"" would be much more appropriate, and it is not used elsewhere in RTK. shrug)."	I don't<strong> request</strong> much, just <em>one</em> <em>drop</em> of those <em>rice grains</em>.		
球		ball	Ball . . . request.		11	1005	935	26	キュウ	たま	Someone files a <em>request</em> to see the family <em>jewels</em> and, to their surprise, you show them your<strong> ball</strong>s!	The <em>KING REQUESTS</em> your presence at the<strong> ball</strong> … game.	You cannot disobey the <em>king</em>, so when he <em>requests</em> to see your<strong> ball</strong>s you have no choice.	"Imaging the <em>King</em> from Katamari Damacy <em>requesting</em> a new<strong> ball</strong> of things to make into a heavenly body! (And don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/2024.html"">clod</a> (#2024 塊), whose reading is <em>katamari</em>…)."	The <em>king requests</em> to see his favorite three<strong> BALL</strong> games: eminent-ball ( 卓球 ; ping pong), field-ball ( 野球 ; baseball), and courtyard-ball ( 庭球 ; tennis). He was having a great time until he caught a<strong> ball</strong> in the golden-jewels ( 金玉 ;<strong> ball</strong>s)!		
救		salvation	Request . . . taskmaster.		11	1006	936	26	キュウ	すく.う	Like in the biblical sense, someone looks skyward and makes a <em>request</em> for<strong> salvation</strong> from this horrible <em>taskmaster</em>…	For<strong> salvation</strong> you have to <em>request</em> forgiveness from God (the ultimate <em>taskmaster</em>).	A cruel <em>taskmaster</em> makes a <em>request</em> to god for<strong> salvation</strong> from the sins commited during his life. Yeaaaah… right.	"[+rtk] Who would need to <em>request</em><strong> salvation</strong> more than <em>Hitler</em>? Hitler has joined the <em>Salvation</em> Army (in order to get some of his own). He hears that they need <em>rice</em>, and figures that the more <em>grains of rice</em> he gets, the more <em>salvation</em> he'll get. So he goes around town in his Santa suit <em>request</em>ing <em>grains of rice</em>. If someone doesn't pony up, he produces a small <em>arrowhead</em> (knives over 6cm are illegal in Japan) and snarls, ""that wasn't a <em>request</em>""."	"He <em>requested</em><strong> salvation</strong> from God, the <em>taskmaster</em> (compare with <a href=""../v4/1744.html"">pardon</a> (#1744 赦))."		
竹		bamboo	<b>Bamboo</b> grows upwards, like a straight <i>nail</i>, and at each stage of its growth (which legend associates with the arrival of the new moon) there is a jointed rootstock (the first stroke). Two such <b>bamboo</b> stalks are pictured here.	* As a primitive, the meaning remains the same, but the vertical lines are severely abbreviated so that they can take their place at the top where, like <i>flowers</i>, they are always to be found.	6	1007	937	26	チク	たけ	Pandas like to eat<strong> bamboo</strong>. I'm using panda as the primitive name when it fits the story. ^__^.	Two <em>reclining</em> victims impaled by<strong> bamboo</strong> <em>spikes</em>.	Since this is a really common kanji and so easy to remember on its own, I just remembered it by it's reading, which is たけ.	"I see this pictographically. Stroke 1: leaf. Stroke 2: joint of stalk. Stroke 3: section of stalk. And it's doubled because it comes in groves (just as you double ""tree"" to make ""grove"")."	Oh NO, NO (think katakana), two pieces of<strong> BAMBOO</strong> stabbed TJ.		
笑		laugh	Bamboo . . . heavens.		10	1008	938	26	ショウ	わら.う、え.む	When the people tried to build a tower of <em>bamboo</em> to reach the <em>heavens</em>, the gods just <strong>laughed</strong> and <strong>laughed</strong>.	Tip: 天 and 夭 (<em>heavens</em> and <em>sapling</em>) are different, but RTK confuses them sometimes. The latter appears in numbers 634, 938, 2078, 2079, 2080, and all characters containing <em>angel</em> 喬 (429, 430, 1221, 2104, 2120, 2369). Story: The fully-grown <em>bamboo</em> trees are<strong> laugh</strong>ing at the little <em>sapling</em>.	That Panda is in <em>bamboo heaven</em>! Just look at him<strong> laugh</strong>!	He couldn't stop<strong> laugh</strong>ing after smoking some <em>Bamboo</em> <em>Heaven</em> the latest in cannabis …	The rustling of the <em>bamboo</em> leaves is the<strong> laugh</strong>ter of the <em>heavens</em>.		
笠		bamboo hat	Bamboo . . . vase.		11	1009	939	26	リュウ	かさ	The <em>bamboo</em> <em>vase</em> was beautifully crafted, but the tourist didn't know what it was and wore it as a little<strong> bamboo hat</strong>.	The <em>bamboo</em> part is easy. Just remember that this kanji refers to those particular <strong>bamboo hats</strong> that are worn primarily by Buddhist monks, who always seem to <em>stand</em> outside of train stations, collecting alms.	Hey, where'd you buy that<strong> bamboo hat</strong>? Over at that <em>bamboo stand</em>!	Just cause you're <em>standing</em> with <em>bamboo</em> on your head, doesn't mean it's a<strong> bamboo hat</strong>!	The<strong> Bamboo hat</strong>, <strong>stands</strong> on your head.		
笹		bamboo grass	Bamboo . . . generation.		11	1010	940	26		ささ	The <em>bamboo</em> <em>generation</em> smokes<strong> bamboo grass</strong>.	"“One of the most attractive aspects of bamboo is that it is a renewable resource; it takes less than a year for a stalk to reach maturity, compared to the decades for most trees, whether needle or broadleaf.” – Mnemonic : ""bamboo grass is the next <em>bamboo generation</em>""."	<strong>Bamboo grass</strong> lasts generations. very strong & durable.	<em>Bamboo</em> is known for its rapid <em>generation</em>. Therefore, even if you spend hours hacking away at bamboo plants, go back the next day and you'll see freshly-sprouted<strong> bamboo grass</strong>. It's almost like it <em>generates</em> before your eyes.	The 70's <em>generation</em> of <em>Panda's</em> smoked a lot of<strong> bamboo grass</strong>.		
箋	䇳	stationery	<i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>float</i>. Note that the drawing of the primitive for <i>float</i> uses the abbreviated form that has become standard in the general-use kanji and as we met it earlier (Frames 393-95). Until such time as typesetting fonts make the adjustment, only the older form has been approved. Here we have opted for the simpler, avant garde drawing.		12	1011	2991	26	セン	ふだ	Note: the spelling should be <strong>stationery</strong> (= paper, office supplies), not<strong> stationary</strong> (= not moving). The error is in the original book.	The <em>two fiestas</em> communicated to each other on their respective floats by using <em>bamboo</em> <strong>stationery</strong>.	They used bamboo stationery to document where and when the two fiestas would take place.	"Because this character was added to the Joyo list in 2010, it now uses a simplified version of the writing. It's now the ""float"" primitive instead of ""two fiestas""."	The fiesta celebrating bamboo and the fiesta celebrating<strong> stationary</strong> combined into one big fiesta celebrating bamboo<strong> stationary</strong>. You get giant bamboo pencils for attending.		
筋		muscle	<i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>part of the body</i> . . . <i>power</i>. Here we see how the primitive meaning of <b>muscle</b> was derived from the kanji for <i>power</i>.		12	1012	941	26	キン	すじ	<strong>Muscle</strong> is part of the body that gives strength, and can be both supple and tense like the bamboo.	Lifting BAMBOO STICKS is an old way for your BODY to put on lots of<strong> MUSCLE</strong>.	If you have enough<strong> MUSCLE</strong> POWER, you can throw BAMBOO to the MOON.	"肋 is <a href=""../v4/2463.html"">rib</a> (#2463 肋). Over your <em>ribs</em> the<strong> muscle</strong> (pecs) can flex and bend like <em>bamboo</em>."	<strong>Muscle</strong> is powerful flesh that bends like bamboo.		
箱		box	Bamboo . . . inter-.		15	1013	942	26	ソウ	はこ	The best kind of<strong> BOX</strong> is made from BAMBOO sticks that are INTER-laced to make it air tight. Just picture such a<strong> box</strong> and you've mastered this kanji.	I think of a<strong> box</strong> made of inter-locking of bamboo strips.	Stick your <em>bamboo</em> in her<strong> box</strong> to have <em>inter-</em>.	BAMBOO that INTER- locks makes a<strong> BOX</strong>. (thanks to Fuaburisu).	Bamboo interwoven, makes a nice<strong> box</strong>.		
筆		writing brush	Bamboo . . . brush.		12	1014	943	26	ヒツ	ふで	<em>Bamboo</em> is the best material from which to make a <em>brush</em> if you want it to be a<strong> writing brush</strong>.	Traditionally, the ふで, or<strong> writing brush</strong>, was made with a <em>bamboo</em> handle and the hair of an animal (usually horse, rabbit, or wolf). Before the advent of paper (which the Chinese invented), writing was also done on segments of bamboo.	When the <em>panda</em> held the magical<strong> writing brush</strong>, he was able to draw every Heisig kanji without having even studied the book. Picture yourself studying for months and the panda picks up the<strong> writing brush</strong> and does better than you.	For <em>bamboo</em>, I visualise <em>panda</em>. The first writing <em>brushes</em> were of an enormous size, because there was no ink as yet and scribes had to write by poking <em>pandas</em> in the backside and writing with panda manure. (<em>Ancient Chinese legend explaining why pandas are so shy and retiring</em>).	My<strong> writing brush</strong> is a “bamboo brush”, my handwriting is both supple and tense, like the bamboo.		
筒		cylinder	Bamboo . . . monk.		12	1015	944	26	トウ	つつ	Seriously, all BAMBOO sticks look the SAME, just long<strong> CYLINDER</strong>S. Should the story be more complicated?	Fully-grown bamboo consists of a number of<strong> cylinder</strong>-like sections, all exactly the same.	A monk is put into a<strong> cylinder</strong> prison made of bamboo bars.	BAMBOO and<strong> CYLINDER</strong>S are the SAME thing.	"A<strong> cylinder</strong> has the <em>same</em> form as <em>bamboo</em> (compare with <a href=""../v4/1001.html"">token</a> (#1001 符), which has the sape of a <a href=""../v4/944.html"">cylinder</a> (#944 筒)))."		
等		etc.	Bamboo . . . Buddhist temple.		12	1016	945	26	トウ	ひと.しい、など、-ら	The <em>Bamboo Buddhist Temple</em> has bamboo buddhas, bamboo buildings, bamboo benches, bamboo beds, bamboo bowls,<strong> etc.</strong><strong> etc.</strong><strong> etc.</strong>	"""So what'd you see in Japan?"" - ""<em>Bamboo</em>, <em>temples</em>…<strong>etc.</strong>""."	"Two Gods sitting in a pub, one God says to the other; ""oh yeah by the way I'm making China today."" The other says, ""how do you do that then?"" God number one replies ""oh you know, a bit of bamboo, a few Buddhist temples,<strong> etc.</strong>.."" God Two ""Not much to it then?"" God One ""No not really, should be done by lunch time, should leave plenty of time to work on my handicap.""."	"One monk at a <em>buddhist temple</em> says to another: ""You only have to look at a <em>bamboo</em> grove to understand the meaning of <strong>et cetera</strong>"". ""How so?"" ""There is no single bamboo plant which catches your attention, no main attraction; they are ALL <strong>et cetera</strong>.""."	"This is the suffix you'd use in referring to a group of people in a familiar or condescending way, such as to jokingly imply you feel they come from, say, a <em>bamboo Buddhist temple</em>. (This is the -ら (-ra)　suffix, as in お前ら omaera <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E5%A5%B4%E3%82%89"">、奴ら</a> yatsura <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E5%83%95%E3%82%89"">、僕ら</a> bokura,<strong> etc.</strong>)."		
算		calculate	Bamboo . . . eyes . . . two hands.		14	1017	946	26	サン	そろ	Before the time of digital <strong>calculators</strong>, people used old school <strong>calculators</strong> made of <em>bamboo</em> (abacus). It's not as easy as a <strong>calculator</strong>, but you don't need any batteries either. All you need are your <em>eyes</em> and your <em>two hands</em>.	Tip : you may see this as an Abacus, which is used to<strong> calculate</strong>. This particular ancient chinese Abacus has <em>eyeballs</em> in place of beads, and its frame is made of <em>bamboo</em>. You'd be amazed at how fast people can<strong> calculate</strong> with this, especially if they can use <em>both hands</em> at once to move the … <em>eyeballs</em>.	Gah! I just can't<strong> calculate</strong> this differential equation! So I take a sharp bamboo pen in each hand and jam them into my eyes out of frustration.	"Warning: a different abacus will be used later as a primitive, see <a href=""../v4/1381.html"">how many</a> (#1381 幾)."	To<strong> calculate</strong> with the <em>bamboo</em> abacus, you need a sharp <em>eye</em> and <em>both hands</em>.		
答		solution	Bamboo . . . fit.		12	1018	947	26	トウ	こた.える、こた.え	The<strong> solution</strong> to this puzzle is, like the match stick game, to make the <em>bamboo</em> pieces <em>fit together</em>.	For the frustrated housewife the<strong> solution</strong> came in form of a BAMBOO stick that FITS her well.	"Be careful not to confuse this with the inter-locking bamboo pieces of <a href=""../v4/942.html"">box</a> (#942 箱). Imagine a child's building-block puzzle.

策		scheme	<i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>belted tree</i> (See frame 446).		12	1019	948	26	サク		The temples in kyoto belt bamboo around trees in a<strong> scheme</strong> to protect them from the huge number of tourists. (true story)———– 対策 たいさく measure, countermeasure.	(Elaboration of jameserb's story:) A clever <strong>scheme</strong> from Wile E Coyote – he ties one of those rubber <em>belts</em> to some <em>trees</em> and uses it to launch a <em>bamboo</em> spear at the roadrunner…	In Japan gardeners use a<strong> scheme</strong> to protect <em>tree</em>s by putting a <em>bamboo</em> <em>belt</em> around them.	"I have trouble recalling this keyword, so I'm going to employ the mnemonic: the ""Bamboo Belt<strong> Scheme</strong>."" It's linked to a true story: In India, the gov't implemented a<strong> SCHEME</strong> to make use of the abundant <em>bamboo belt</em> in the north of the country. As compared to the hardwood <em>trees</em> there, bamboo is highly renewable and will create rural jobs in a push for 300% increase in bamboo production. There. Bamboo, not trees. It's in the<strong> scheme</strong>."	The<strong> scheme</strong> was to capture him, tie him to a <em>tree</em> with a <em>belt</em>, and whip him with the <em>bamboo</em>.		
簿		register	Bamboo . . . water . . . acupuncturist.		19	1020	949	26	ボ		Note : the keyword is not a verb, think of a record book. This <em>acupuncturist</em> who uses <em>bamboo</em> in place of flowers to dilute <em>water</em> into his patients (see frame 227), managed somehow to appear on the<strong> register</strong> of acupuncturists. Chances are, he won't stay on the<strong> register</strong> for long. My image is close to that of gorgon's story.	This doctor dilutes (see 227) his patients with bamboo stalks rather than the flowers of a standard diluting acupuncturist hence he needs to be on the Bamboo Accumpunturist Diltuers (BAD)<strong> register</strong>. Pumping that much water into a body can be dangerous; see the huge bamboo stems with gallons of water sloshing in and out of the patient.	The <em>acupuncturist</em> was not very good. His <em>bamboo</em> needles made his patients cry copious amounts of <em>water</em>. He was put on a<strong> register</strong> of doctors to avoid.	After <em>diluting</em> your bad humours with flowers in Frame 217, the <em>acupuncturist</em> pulls out a <em>bamboo</em> slab and asks you to sign the<strong> register</strong>, including your e-mail address, so that you can receive periodic updates on special promotions and also read his blog.	The keyword refers to<strong> register</strong> as in an expense book. I imagine a wealthy housewife writing up her elaborate and unnecessary expenses in her<strong> register</strong> notebook: fancy <em>bamboo</em> flatware, sparkling <em>water</em>, her weekly trip to the <em>acupuncturist</em>, and so on…		
築		fabricate	Bamboo . . . craft . . . mediocre . . . wood/tree.		16	1021	950	26	チク	きず.く	<em>Bamboo craft</em>ing is a <em>mediocre</em> substitute for <em>wood</em> when you are <strong>build</strong>ing or <strong>fabricat</strong>ing a house. While it may look good and might attract a chick (ちく) or two, the kids'll (きず) just tear it to pieces as its not sturdy enough.	A bamboo fabrication is a mediocre substitute for wood.	If you<strong> fabricate</strong> a boat from <em>bamboo</em> you get a pretty <em>mediocre craft</em>. Use <em>wood</em> instead.	"Just as you wouldn't want heart surgeons who were <em>mediocre</em> at their <em>craft</em> operating on you (see raulir's story for <a href=""../v4/613.html"">fear</a> (#613 恐)), you also wouldn't want house builders who were <em>mediocre</em> at their <em>craft</em> <strong>fabricating</strong> your house for you–they might<strong> fabricate</strong> a flimsy one of <em>bamboo</em> instead of sturdy one of <em>wood</em>. 建築 (けんちく): construction, architecture 建築家 (けんちくか): architect 築き上げる (きずきあげる): to build up/establish (one's reputation) Careful: <a href=""../v4/869.html"">erect</a> (#869 架)."

篭	籠	basket	<i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>dragon</i>. Note that the older (and still official) form of this kanji uses the old character for dragon 龍, which is good to learn and is fun to write in any case. It is made up of five primitive elements: <i>vase</i> . . . <i>flesh</i> . . . <i>slingshot</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> (enclosure) . . . <i>three</i>.		16	1022	2638	26	ロウ、ル	かご、こ.める、こも.る、こ.む	The only<strong> cage</strong> that can keep a <em>dragon</em> is made of <em>bamboo</em>.	A <em>bamboo</em> <strong>cage</strong> won't hold a <em>dragon</em>!	A <em>bamboo</em><strong> cage</strong> has a 50% chance of containing a <em>dragon</em> (thanks Mantixen and cb4960) I should add that this is yet another example of Heisig choosing a less used simplification. 籠 is more common.	"立て篭る =立て籠る, 印籠 =印篭<a href=""../v4/2638.html"">cage</a> (#2638 篭)ロウ, かご, こもる … Parts: 竹 , 竜 /龍 ( 印籠 <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/3028"">cage [old]</a> (#3028 籠), 龍安寺 <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2981"">dragon [old]</a> (#2981 龍) … Note: When かご is written in Kanji, it can use simple form 篭 . The verb (たって)こもる uses the old form of Dragon. Probably better to learn 龍 <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2981"">dragon [old]</a> (#2981 龍) and then get used to seeing either the old or new form of dragon in any Kanji using it as a part, rather than trying to remember one or the other. This is true for all Kanji using dragon 滝 -瀧 etc."	German: Ein Käfig aus brennbaren Bambus taugt wohl nicht so recht um einen Drachen - egal ob alt oder jung - einzufangen oder gar gefangen zu halten. Um seine Laune zu verschlechtern, taugt der Käfig wohl aber doch…		
人		person	The character for <i>enter</i> (Frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for <b>person</b>, shown here, represents someone walking outwards.	* As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ). The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of <i>person</i> so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use <i>person</i> for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular <i>person</i>. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination.	2	1023	951	27	ジン、ニン	ひと、-り、-と	"Behold Mister T (of ""A-Team"" fame)! I chose Mr.T because he's sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he's both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic”<strong> person</strong>, telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”."	[I appreciate some people's occasional habit of using <em>P</em> for <strong>person</strong> in shared stories. That makes it easier to substitute <em>Mr. T</em>, <em>Captain Picard</em>, or whomever else a student is using as <strong>person.</strong>].	<em>Khatzumoto</em>.	For this character, I'm going to use Chuck Norris. He is a world class martial artist, winning several karate championships in a row. He also achieved ultimate power according to his Chuck Norris Facts, and works as a Texas Ranger (sheriff). He is however a very kind and religious<strong> person</strong>. Here we have a view of his powerful legs, while the contracted form shows him performing a roundhouse kick.	JESUS.		
佐		assistant	Person . . . left.		7	1024	952	27	サ		"Mr T's<strong> assistant</strong> is on his left. Why? Because Mr T has this bad habit of suddenly extending his right arm (what with all the boxing that he did), and his<strong> assistant</strong> got inadvertently punched in the face more than once (ouch). So now his<strong> assistant</strong> is always to his left side, much safer - ""Stay on my <em>left</em>, foo!""."	"On your right is your ""right-hand man"" that you credit for all your success….on the left…… is your<strong> assistant</strong> who does all the grunt work and gets no credit for anything…"	"Your left-hand man.

""I pity da foo got no <em>spine</em>"", he says."	<em>Mr. T</em> needs a<strong> partner</strong> with a strong <em>spine</em> as he's a beast in the bedroom.

As with all the bling, he has to keep up appearances, you know. Now all the people on his street are just 'trying to keep up with the T's' (as opposed to 'keeping up with the Jones').	<em>Mister T</em><strong> dwell</strong>s in a <em>big brass candlestick</em>, the flame of which serves as a beacon for the boats in the nearby harbour. Sometimes in the morning, <em>Mister T</em> has to clear the wax that has landed and solidified in front of the door.	A <em>person</em><strong> dwell</strong>s in the place where he puts his candlesticks.	<em>Khatzumoto</em> doesn't<strong> dwell</strong> on the past when he sucked in Japanese.

"<em>Mr. T</em><strong> rank</strong>ed number one in the ""last man <em>standing</em>"" boxing tournament. You can imagine <em>Mr. T</em> <em>standing</em> atop all his fallen rivals to exemplify his top<strong> rank</strong>ing."	In martial arts, you reach the highest<strong> RANK</strong> if you can <strong>stand</strong> against a <strong>roundhouse kick</strong> from <strong>Chuck Norris</strong> (person).

"In ""The Phantom Menace"" the <em>Jedi</em> were asked to act as<strong> go-between</strong>s, placing them <em>in the middle of</em> the Senate and Trade Alliance conflict. (Also, this is the 'naka' in 'nakama' 仲間 ). 仲人 (ちゅうにん) :<strong> go-between</strong>, matchmaker; 仲良し (なかよし) : intimate friend, close friend."	Mr T literally goes between two persons, through the middle of their guts, acting as some kind of link in their personal relations, or as a middleman.

Yoda, the <em>Jedi</em> with the <em>walking stick</em> who was a hard <em>taskmaster</em> for Luke but who had a big <em>heart</em>, was <strong>permanently</strong> exiled on the<strong> remote</strong> planet Dagobah.	"Even a <em>person</em> being hit with a <em>walking-stick</em> by the <em>taskmaster</em>, can remain calm if their <em>heart</em> is<strong> remote</strong>.

"I'm having a hard time keep straight just which animal Mr. T is having an<strong> affair</strong> with. chamcham's story made me realize that Mr. T is not having an ""affair"", he's having an ""heifair."" Get it?"	The <em>Jedi</em> Anakin rides a <em>cow</em> (a Shaak) on Naboo to try to impress Padme and draw her into an<strong> affair</strong>.

Imagine <em>Tom Cruise</em> outside in the final scene, stabbing his knife into his stomach, while <em>Mr T</em> looks patiently on. ""I pity da foo….no, really.""."	"<em>Mr. T</em> has become a <em>samurai</em>. Now he has to <strong>attend</strong> his feudal lord. ""I pity da foo don't <strong>attend</strong> to his lord"", says <em>Mr. T</em>."	Mr T<strong> attend</strong>s to the samurai doing harakiri. .	<em>Jedi</em> and <em>samurai</em> were very similar types…in spite of their awesome abilities, both devoted their lives to serving and<strong> attend</strong>ing to others. 仕事 (しごと) : work, occupation, employment; 仕える (つかえる) : to serve, to work for.		
他		other	Person . . . scorpion.		5	1034	961	27	タ	ほか	It's one or the <strong>other</strong>: fight <em>Mr. T</em>, or be thrown into the <em>scorpion</em> pit.	Old latin saying: homo hominis scorpio (<em>people</em> are <em>scorpions</em> to<strong> other</strong> <em>people</em>).	"<em>Mr. T</em> picks a live scorpion up off the ground and starts munching on it. ""Mmmmm…. <em>scorpion</em>. The<strong> other</strong> white meat""."	P is an animal lover, he already had an affair with a cow (frame 959) and his<strong> other</strong> lover is a scorpion.

"<em>Mr T</em> has beaten up the <em>chihuahua</em>, who lies<strong> prostrated</strong> in front of him. ""Now,"" <em>Mr T</em> says, ""I quiero some Taco Bell!""."	Rocco likes to prostrate women in front of him in a dog-like position…	<em>Haruhi</em> orders everyone to sit like a <em>dog</em> in a<strong> prostrated</strong> position.	"“Get up foo, you ain't no <em>chihuahua</em>!"" says <em>Mr. T</em> to the obsessive fan<strong> prostrated</strong> on the ground in front of him. ""I pity da foo who gets hiself<strong> prostrated</strong> before anyone like a little dumb ass <em>chihuahua</em>!"" says <em>Mr. T</em>.

伝		transmit	<i>Person</i> . . . <i>rising cloud</i>. Hint: the Amerindians' smoke signal scan help provide a good image for this kanji, whose key word is meant to include <b>transmissions</b> of all sorts.		6	1036	963	27	デン、テン	つた.わる、つた.える、つた.う、つだ.う、-づた.い、つて	"Mister T<strong> transmit</strong>s a message with rising clouds (smoke) signals, to a nearby American Indian tribe.

仏		Buddha	Person . . . elbow.		4	1037	964	27	ブツ、フツ	ほとけ	"<em>Mr. T</em> says, ""I ain't afraid o' no foo! I'll give anyone an <em>elbow</em> to the face, I don't care if it's <em>Buddha</em> himself!""."	<strong>Buddha</strong> is a <em>person</em> who always seems to have his <em>elbows</em> bent.	Out of respect for<strong> Buddha</strong>, <em>Chuck Norris</em> simply <em>elbows</em> him rather than roundhouse-kicking him in the face. However, the sheer force of <em>Chuck Norris's elbow</em> is still powerful enough to bring<strong> Buddha</strong> to enlightenment in one blow.	"""If you see the<strong> Buddha</strong>, kill him"" goes the koan. <em>Mr T</em> wouldn't go that far, but he'd certainly be prepared to <em>elbow</em> the guy in the ribs…"	In Japan, <em>Dracula</em> fears images of<strong> Buddha</strong> rather than the cross, so here you see him with his crooked <em>elbow</em> raised in the classic movie pose, holding his cape up to cover his face, as someone confronts him with a tiny<strong> Buddha</strong> statue.		
休		rest	<i>Person</i> . . . <i>tree</i>.

Imagine <em>Luke Skywalker</em> taking a<strong> rest</strong> by a tree, as he struggles to complete Yoda's tasks.	"<strong>Mr. T</strong> doesn't <em>rest</em> like the <em>rest</em> of us. He recovers by yanking out a <strong>tree</strong> by the roots. ""I pity da foo that has to <em>rest</em>""."

"Mr. T was offered a job in the Iraq<strong> Provisional</strong> Authority, but he turned it down, because he's anti-war. ""I pity da fool thinks this sand pit worth invadin' when our schools be in such sad shape!""."	If<strong> provisional</strong> governments are left in power for too long, the <em>people</em> will begin to turn <em>anti-</em>establishment.	The<strong> provisional</strong> government established under Palpatine was a <strong>sham</strong>, lead by a Sith, an <em>anti Jedi</em>.	<em>Haruhi</em> is <em>anti-</em>provisional: she always wants her changes to be permanent.

伯		chief	Person . . . white dove.		7	1041	967	27	ハク		If <em>Mr T</em> was <em>white</em> I am sure he would have been commander in<strong> chief</strong> of the USA, he just the sort of clown Americans love to vote for. (NB: I tried with the indian<strong> chief</strong> motif but kept adding feathers by mistake).	<em>Mr T</em> was originally supposed to be the<strong> chief</strong> of the A-Team, but then the producers realized that America didn't want to see a Black guy as the<strong> chief</strong> of a prime-time TV show. So here, we see <em>Mr T</em> doing a bunch of <em>cocaine</em>, and then spreading it all over his face to look <em>white</em>, and trying out for the part of Hannibal. The directors were so impressed that they let him stunt double for Hannibal in a few episodes. OR, <em>Mr T</em> <strong>chief</strong>in' on some <em>crack cocaine</em>. You make the call.	OMG that kanji is racist!!! It shows the<strong> chief</strong> as a <em>white person</em>!!! Let's change it!	This also means <strong>Count</strong>… <strong>Count</strong> <em>Dracula</em>, the<strong> chief</strong> vampire, is easily recognized by his pale <em>white</em> skin, gleaming <em>white</em> fangs, <em>white</em> shirt, <em>white gloves</em>, et cetera.	Only the <em>jedi</em><strong> chief</strong> gets to use a <em>white</em> lightsaber.

Looking at the<strong> vulgar</strong> (common) people, Mr T says - “I pity you foo!”.	Most of the personages in the valley are<strong> vulgar</strong> types – miners, farmers, day laborers.	Oh nooo! <em>Mr.T</em> tasting a <em>female valley</em>, how<strong> vulgar</strong>!	<em>Anakin Skywalker</em> hated the Tuscan Raiders because of their<strong> vulgar</strong> animal-like behaviour.

But only after grabbing it do they realize it is chained to the neck of <em>Mr. T</em>, who grimaces angrily at them. ""Bogus!"" they cry, and totally run away."	In Holland, when a person gives you an<strong> excellent</strong> mark for a test or an exam, he'll give you <em>10</em> out of <em>10</em> (10/10) and he underlines the numbers to emphasize your excellence!	The <em>square jewel</em> chained to the neck of <em>Mr.T</em> is what makes him<strong> excellent</strong>.	"<strong>""Excellent!""</strong> said by Charles Montgomery Burns as he gloats over a captured <em>P</em> tied down with <em>ivy</em> (think Lilliputians and Gulliver)."

"Mr. T teaching a fighting class, ""For <strong>example</strong>, watch me beat the hell out of this <em>file</em> of <em>skeleton warriors</em>""."	<em>Chuck Norris</em> made an<strong> example</strong> of a group of criminals - he delivered one single roundhouse-kick to the entire <em>file</em> of them, stripping each one of skin and flesh until only their <em>bones</em> and <em>swords</em> remained.

So he is a<strong> waiter</strong> at the <em>Buddhist temple</em>, attending upon the zen monks, serving green tea, etc. (but mostly, he is annoying all the monks with the noise of his big gold chains).	I think its best if we derive this from 待 (wait). So the<strong> waiter</strong>, WAITS for the people to pick their order by holding the menu [extra stroke] in his hand. This clever keyword allows one to go from<strong> waiter</strong> -> person that SERVES you. A samurai was bound by oath to SERVE their master etc etc, 侍女 【じじょ】 (n) lady attendant, maid, (P) 侍医 【じい】 (n) court physician, (P).

仁		humanity	To refer to the fullness of <b>humanity</b> that can only be achieved in dialogue with another (<i>person</i> . . . <i>two</i>), Confucius used this character.		4	1063	988	27	ジン、ニ、ニン		Mr. T shows his<strong> humanity</strong> by giving <em>two</em> bucks to every homeless person he sees.	<strong>Warning</strong>: This is not<strong> humanity</strong> as in all the people. But rather the qualities that make us human such as compassion and benevolence.	This character, as Heisig points out, is strongly Confucian. Some scholars say that it references the importance of <strong>humane</strong> relationships between <em>two people</em> (parent/child, sibling/sibling, ruler/subject, etc). It's easy enough, though, to look at it as a person in a dialogue with another - the give and take, yin and yang - the <em>two</em>-way street in which<strong> humanity</strong> relates to each other.	<strong>Humanity</strong> began with <em>two people</em>, adam and eve.	<strong>Humanity</strong> needs only two things: CHUCK and NORRIS.

If you MUZZLE MR.T, prepare for<strong> DOUBLE</strong> trouble!	<strong>Double</strong>s his pleasure,<strong> double</strong>s his fun, Man puts on a muzzle, and gets his S&M on.	<em>Khatzumoto</em> has problems with his<strong> double</strong> language usage, so he keeps L1 <em>muzzled</em> while he studies L2.

It's best to stick to the first meaning, because the last two are very close to ""mediator"" which will come in frame 1761. The idea here is that the <em>arrow</em> is not a toothpick, neither it is changed into one, but it can<strong> substitute</strong> for one."	Mr. T shot the<strong> substitute</strong> teacher with an arrow.	"The gym teacher asks <em>Mr. T</em> to<strong> substitute</strong> for him on the day the kids will be shooting <em>arrows</em> for archery class. Imagine going home and telling your friends ""dude!

袋		sack	Substitute . . . garment.		11	1081	1006	27	タイ、ダイ	ふくろ	A<strong> sack</strong> is an easy substitute for a garment.	"A worker who was recently<strong> sack</strong>ed from his job, is wearing a<strong> sack</strong> of potatoes as a <em>substitute garment</em> (naked otherwise), in some kind of protest. The kanji is close to frame 1547 ""bag"", and although the later really refers to a ""straw<strong> sack</strong>"", I use the image of a<strong> sack</strong> of potatoes here, and that of a ""plastic bag"" for frame 1547. The keywords would have been better swapped in my opinion, but the relevancy is not so important at this point (see notes of Lesson 31 in the book)."	If you're super poor, you can <em>substitute</em> a potato <strong>sack</strong> for normal <em>garments</em>.	When my clothes went missing I found a quick substitute - a<strong> sack</strong>!

"Flash back a second…<em>Mr T</em> is still your <em>substitute</em> teacher.

"I pictured the ""<em>substitute shells</em>"" as semi-transparent, or ghostly money, symbolising how they only stand for money that you didn't have in the first place. – ""lended <em>shells</em> are <em>substitute shells</em>""."

Note: as a primitive, it can help to use the image of ""spare<strong> change</strong>"", this can help you keep it distinct from other similar kanji such as ""shape"" or ""turn into""."	I just see this one as a pictograph of a person changing position and sitting down.	<em>Mr. T</em> reaches into his wallet for some spare<strong> change</strong> but it has all<strong> change</strong>d into <em>spoons</em>.

Don't confuse with the similar 賃 <a href=""../v4/1004.html"">fare</a> (#1004 賃)."	This is a<strong> freight</strong> train that runs on <em>spare change</em>. Imagine getting on the<strong> freight</strong> train with a bunch of <em>spare change</em>. You put in some <em>change</em> and it starts up…goes for a few minutes, then starts to slow down. You look at the slot..there's actually a slot for <em>spare change</em> and one for regular <em>shells</em>. Your call, but it seems to prefer <em>spare change</em> over <em>shells</em>.	Countries like to <em>change</em> <em>money</em> by trading<strong> freight</strong>.	This is also commonly used to mean currency, which is easier to remember given the kanji I think. When you travel abroad you change your clams into the local currency. Easy breezy.	You catch the<strong> freight</strong> train, but suddenly realise you did not bring enough <em>money</em>. You turn out your pockets to show the inspector that you have nothing but spare <em>change</em>.		
傾		lean	<i>Change</i> . . . <i>head</i>. The key word has the sense of <b>leaning</b> on or toward someone or something.		13	1086	1011	27	ケイ	かたむ.く、かたむ.ける、かたぶ.く、かた.げる、かし.げる	<em>Mr. T</em> gave a girl some <em>change</em> to<strong> lean</strong> over and give him <em>head</em>.	I didn't study for the test at all! So what else could I do? When the guy beside me wasn't looking, I<strong> lean</strong>ed over, and <em>changed</em> his <em>page</em> with mine!	"Referring to the movie ""The Elephant Man"" by director David Lynch, here we see Elephant Man<strong> lean</strong>ing on his bed, wishing he could <em>change his head</em>. He knew very well he could not lie down, for he would die unable to breathe, and thus he always slept<strong> lean</strong>ing on a few cushions."	Your <em>head</em> <strong>leans</strong> around the corner to watch the girl <em>changing</em> her underwear.	<strong>Lean</strong> over so I can change your head, said man to his robot.

"My story is similar to rptb1, only that the<strong> baggage</strong> is extremely heavy, and when the guards open it they see flowers and say ""<em>What</em> kind of <em>flowers</em> is that !?"" (you would never imagine flowers would make<strong> baggage</strong> this heavy)."		
俊		sagacious	Person . . . license . . . walking legs.		9	1089	1014	27	シュン		The entire town wants to get rid of <em>legal prostitutes</em>, but the<strong> sagacious</strong> <em>Mr T</em> realizes that they are a benefit to the economy and society. So he lets the sa-geishas stay.	(re: sweetneet) Since he is not very<strong> sagacious</strong>, <em>Mr. T</em> failed his driver's <em>license</em> and now needs to resort to his <em>walking legs</em> to get around.	"This is the first time I heard of the word<strong> sagacious</strong>, so I looked it up at dictionary.com and found <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&amp;q=sagacious"">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&amp;q=sagacious</a>. For the definition they give the example of ""a<strong> sagacious</strong> lawyer"". And let a lawyer be a <em>person</em> that has a <em>license</em> to practice law and who <em>walks</em> frantically through the courtroom as he tries to sway the jury. To add some drama: he's defending Osama bin Laden (can be used as the <em>person</em> element)."	People who just get their drivers <em>license</em> think they are better than anyone else. But, in reality, the <em>people</em> who are<strong> sagacious</strong> are the ones who used their <em>walking legs</em> as much as possible (since it's better for their health).	"A <em>person</em> who is has been a <em>streetwalker</em> is probably very<strong> sagacious</strong> about human nature. see <a href=""../v4/766.html"">tempt</a> (#766 唆)."		
傍		bystander	Person . . . stand . . . crown . . . compass.		12	1090	1015	27	ボウ	かたわ.ら、わき、おか-、はた、そば	In Japan, the emperor is a<strong> bystander</strong> - he <em>stands on his crown</em> but can't really affect the <em>direction</em> of the country. (thx shimouma).	Mr. T is in the street, standing up, wearing an golden crown and a compass in his hand… he's asking the<strong> bystander</strong> if they know how to get to buckingham palace (!).	<em>Mr. T</em> is tired of being a<strong> bystander</strong>, he <em>stands up</em> and takes the king's <em>crown</em> for himself to change the <em>direction</em> of the country.	"Side Note: The right side of this kanji is itself a kanji (but not a kanji given in Heisig) meaning ""The right hand side of a kanji"" (旁【つくり】). It can also mean ""at the same time."" Not sure if this is useful, but it seemed interesting…"	Many cultures have some traditional story about the <em>sovereign</em> who disguises himself as a peasant or traveler, a<strong> bystander</strong> if you will, to judge the moral <em>compass</em> of his <em>people</em>.		
俺		myself	The key word refers to a very familiar way of referring to oneself, typically used by men. Its component elements: <i>person</i> . . . <i>St. Bernard</i> . . . <i>eel</i>.		10	1091	2058	27	エン	おれ、われ	<strong>Myself</strong> as used by men – a <em>person</em> who prides himself on how <em>big</em> his “<em>eel</em>” is.	"""I did it all by<strong> myself</strong>!"" <em>Mr T</em> stands there proud as holding a <em>moray eel</em> in his hand. He's brought down terrorist organisations, drug syndicates, but gets all worked up when catching a fish… what a guy."	"As astridtops mentions, this is ""Ore"". In Japanese r = l, so could write it ""Ole"". So picture a bullfight with <em>person</em> as the matador and a <em>dachshund</em> replacing the bull. The crowd keep shouting ""Ole! (Ore)""."	"(note: this is the kanji for 'ore'). ""I,<strong> myself</strong>, am the <em>person</em> who will kill the <em>Midgard Snake</em>"", the god Thor bellows. Since he's not known for his politeness, you can see him using 'ore' to refer to himself…"	"<em>Mr T</em> is unfortunately bragging a bit here - ""Myself? I have got a pretty big mini-<strong>myself</strong>. It's actually right around the size of a <em>moray eel</em>, sucka."" And as opposed to the Japanese, who point to their noses to refer to their own<strong> myself</strong>, or cultures that point to their body, when <em>Mr T</em> wants to refer to his<strong> myself</strong>, he points to his <em>moray eel</em>."		
久		long time	This character uses the diagonal sweep of the second stroke to double up for <i>bound up</i> and a <i>person</i>. Think of a mummy, and the key word will not be far behind.		3	1092	1016	27	キュウ、ク	ひさ.しい	Note: this is the ひさ in ひさしぶり .<strong> Long time</strong> no see <em>mummy</em>! (A bound up person).	"This is a picture of a person bowing ""long time no see!""."	"Be careful if you're using alternate primitives for this kanji! There are only three strokes, and the stroke order is similar to <em>bound up</em> with an extra 'leg' like the last stroke of <em>person</em>. Using <em>recline</em> and <em>person</em> would give you four strokes. Using <em>drop</em> and <em>enter</em> would give the wrong stroke order and the wrong shape in handwritten kanji, even though they all look kind of the same in print. See <a href=""http://www.mahou.org/Kanji/3557/"">http://www.mahou.org/Kanji/3557/</a> (bottom of page) for the handwritten style."	That <em>bound up</em> <em>person</em> is a <em>mummy</em>, he's been that way for a<strong> long time</strong>.	A mummy is a <em>person</em> who has been <em>bound up</em> for a <strong>long time</strong>.		
畝		furrow	Think of the three kinds of <b>furrows</b> shown here in this character - a <i>top hat's</i> rim, a <i>rice field's</i> ridges, and the wrinkles that show you've been around a <i>long time</i>.		10	1093	1017	27	ボウ、ホ、モ、ム	せ、うね	Using a TOP HAT to make<strong> FURROW</strong>S in the RICE FIELD takes a LONG TIME!	A <em>mummy</em> tries to<strong> furrow</strong> his brow but realizes that he's got no head - just a <em>brain</em> with a <em>top-hat</em> on it. So he <strong>furrow</strong>s his <em>brain</em>. [trigger:<strong> furrow</strong> your <em>brain</em>].	A man from the city, thus wearing a <em>top hat</em>, working in a <em>field</em>, takes a very <em>long time</em> to dig a simple<strong> furrow</strong>.	Correct keyword: <strong>ridge</strong> ( 畔 ->waterside). ( 畝 is used in 畝間 , meaning<strong> furrow</strong>, but that's because the interval between ridges is a<strong> furrow</strong>). Words: 畝 (ridge/rib), 畝織り (ridged fabric). Story: A <em>rice field</em> is actually a secret burial ground for <em>mummies</em>. Each <strong>ridge</strong> is actually a sarcophagus. The <em>mummies</em> are buried under the <strong>ridges</strong>, and each <em>mummy</em> has a <em>top hat</em> which takes up the remaining length of the <strong>ridge</strong>, filled with his riches.	The farmer uses a <em>mummy</em> to plow<strong> furrow</strong>s in the <em>field</em>, but he disguises him with a <em>tophat</em> so he doesn't scare the neighbors.		
囚		captured	Person . . . pent in.		5	1094	1018	27	シュウ	とら.われる	A person <em>pent in</em> is obviously<strong> captured</strong>. Imagine a man put inside a wooden box, his evil capturers waiting for ransom money.	Mr. T can't be<strong> captured</strong>. This kanji is lying.	They've finally <em>pent in</em> <em>Mr. T</em>. But don't worry; no one can keep T<strong> captured</strong>, foo!	There is a butt<strong> captured</strong> within this picture. Lol!	"This is a very easy kanji. A PERSON who is PENT IN is obviously<strong> captured</strong>. DO NOT USE MR. T! Why people are using this as a primitive element is beyond me. MR. T is the variant of person when it appears on the left side of a kanji. Do not confuse your PERSON and MR. T or you'll never know which one to use when you have a MR. T story. Keep each version of a primitive distinct in your naming. (Think of the difference between using ""heart"" and ""valentine"")."		
内		inside	<i>Person</i> . . . <i>belt</i>. Note that we cannot use the primitive meaning of <i>hood</i> here because the <i>person</i> runs THROUGH the element, not under it.		4	1095	1019	27	ナイ、ダイ	うち	<em>Mr. T</em>'s new <em>belt</em> is huge! When he's <strong>inside</strong> it, his feet no longer touch the ground!	A seat<em>belt</em> keeps a <em>person</em><strong> inside</strong> the vehicle.	How is a <em>person</em> ever supposed to get<strong> inside</strong> that girl when she's wearing such a huge chastity <em>belt</em>? I guess that's kinda the point, eh?	A person who fell through the roof of their house, now their legs are<strong> inside</strong>.	In Washington DC someone who is an<strong> inside</strong>r is someone who knows everything within the <em>belt</em> way.		
丙		third class	"Those no-frills flights the airlines offer to attract customers should help create an image from <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>person</i> . . . <i>belt</i>. The kanji meaning ""<i>inside</i>"" should not be used because of its proximity to the element for ""<i>in</i>."""		5	1096	1020	27	ヘイ	ひのえ	In this<strong> third class</strong> flight, the seat<em>belts</em> are so bad that with the slightest turbulence all the <em>persons</em> hit the ceiling. (it's almost pictographic here!).	Travelling by ship <strong>third class</strong> the cabins are all <em>inside</em> (no windows) and the <em>ceilings</em> are so low you hit your head.	But<strong> third class</strong> is so small Mr. T's head hits the celing.	Mr T. hates flying<strong> third class</strong>. His head hits the ceiling, and the buckle on the seatbelts scratch his new belt.	The <em>ceiling</em> <em>inside</em><strong> third class</strong> is exceptionally low.		
柄		design	Tree . . . third class.		9	1097	1021	27	ヘイ	がら、え、つか	Half Way!!!!	"This is a ""<em>design</em>"" as in a ""pattern"", not a verb as in ""to <em>design</em>"". The <strong>tree</strong> grain <em>design</em> was too expensive for the <strong>third class</strong> airline to use for the panelling. They just painted it."	Makes me think of Ikea. Everything is <em>wooden</em> and the<strong> design</strong> is really nice but the quality really is <em>third rate.</em>.	The third class seats on the train are very simply<strong> design</strong>ed. In fact, they're not<strong> design</strong>ed at all. They're just wooden stumps of trees.	<strong>DESIGN</strong> makes me think of 'intelligent<strong> design</strong>', the <em>third class</em> alternative to evolution for the hard-of-thinking. You'd have to have solid <em>wood</em> between your ears to believe it!		
肉		meat	"Let this doubling of one of the elements for ""<i>inside</i>"" yield the sense of ""<i>insides</i>"" to approach the key word, <b>meat</b>. The abbreviated form of this character gave us the primitive meaning of <i>flesh</i> or <i>part of the body</i> for the kanji 月."		6	1098	1022	27	ニク	しし	Here we are looking at an x-ray of a cannibal whose insides are full on people-meat.	A <em>person's</em> <em>inside</em> - fleshy, raw, pink,<strong> meat</strong>.	"To avoid confusion with the <em>flesh</em> primitive from <a href=""../v4/13.html"">month</a> (#13 月), I'm nicknaming this one: <em>soylent green</em>. It's easy to remember since ""Soylent green is people!""."	Inside a person is<strong> meat</strong>.	I like narafan's story that captures the primitives nicely, but I'm with Rakushun and fuaburisu - this is just a pictograph of a slab of<strong> meat</strong> (I picture a t-bone steak), and it gets reinforced since you constantly see it on menus.		
腐		rot	Municipality . . . meat.		14	1099	1023	27	フ	くさ.る、-くさ.る、くさ.れる、くさ.れ、くさ.らす、くさ.す	The <strong>rotting</strong> <em>meat</em> <em>adheres</em> to the <em>cave</em> walls.	Smaller <em>municipalities</em> are well known for filling their budgets with <em>pork (meat)</em>. Thats why they are also well known for being<strong> rot</strong>ten.	The <em>municipality</em> workers in their <em>cave</em> are too busy with bueraucracy and <em>adhering</em> to rules so they cannot regulate and measure the huge delivery of <em>meat</em> that was made days ago. So it just lies in the back of the cave to<strong> rot</strong> as more work piles up.	Resident Evil reference: The MUNICIPALITY of Raccoon City has been overrun by<strong> ROT</strong>TEN MEAT (zombies).	There's something<strong> rot</strong>ten in the municipality of Denmark.

CONGRATULATIONS YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE!!!! =).	Nice one Gorgon. I thought I would mention that the stroke order is non-standard here. With <em>soil</em> the vertical stroke comes first.	While working on an <em>assembly line</em> in a <em>cave</em>, there no benches on which to<strong> sit</strong>, so everyone just <strong>sits</strong> on the <em>ground</em>.	Tea break on the coal assembly line — Time to all<strong> sit</strong> in the dirt. (Coal mine is a cave of course :) You<strong> sit</strong> DOWN so the vertical downstroke of soil comes first! [—Thanks gorgon & wrightak!].

"(Using the primitives in the RTK1 addendum) The workers at the <em>assembly line</em> in the coal cave (<a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1024"">squat/sit</a> (#1024 座)) frequently claim to ""<strong>sprain</strong>"" their <em>fingers</em> because working within all the <em>dirt</em> around them is hard and they'd much rather stay at home."	I<strong> sprain</strong>ed in my <em>finger</em> doing a complicated mudra while <em>sitting in meditation</em>.	You might<strong> SPRAIN</strong> your FINGERS while SITTING IN MEDITATION if you suddenly put your hand out to catch yourself after falling asleep.	With your <em>fingers</em> you try to repair an <em>assembly</em> line that got broken after some <em>soil/dirt</em> got into it. But then the <em>assembly line</em> suddenly starts working.

It took them <em>10 years</em> (Bachelor's, Masters, PhD) to get there…. :-p.	When you<strong> graduate</strong>, you wear a hat and<strong> graduate</strong> in an assembly line while your parents sit on pins and needles because it will take ten years to pay off those loans.	In the distant future, universities will produce<strong> graduate</strong>s on <em>assembly lines</em>. As the kids move along on a conveyor belt they are injected with knowledge via a <em>needle</em> from below while overhead robotic arms place <em>square caps with tassels</em> on their heads. This way it only takes a few minutes to<strong> graduate</strong>.	The <em>couple</em> counted to <em>ten</em> before tossing their <em>top hats</em> at <strong>graduation</strong>.	Forget the heisig stuff for this one. To me it looks like a little stick figure in a graduation cap with happy eyes. Hes happy, I mean he is graduating after all.

匁		monme	This character obliges us once again to make use of a Japanese key word for want of an English equivalent. It refers to an old unit of weight, equal to about 3.75 grams. The word is only slightly more useful in modern Japanese than cubits and kites are in modern English. Its primitives, if you look closely, are: <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>arm</i>.		4	1104	1027	28		もんめ、め	"""Dude! What happened to your arm! It's all bound up!"" ""Yeah man, it's a bummer… with my arm like this I can only lift one<strong> monme</strong>!""."	"""Dude! What happened to your arm! It's all bound up!"" ""Yeah man, it's a bummer… with my arm like this I can only lift one<strong> monme</strong>!"" ""You'll never be able to use your dagger now!"" (adapted from ergerg)."	In Jamaica: Hey <strong>mon, may</strong> I have some (3.75 grams to be exact) uh dat leaf? I need it fo medical reasons. Look at my bound up arm!	Either Heisig or the person who put this on the list is an asshole. Most JP people have never seen it. Heisig admits is useless. I hope his arms get bound up by the police for carrying a<strong> monme</strong> of crack.	Very difficult to picture, however, a<strong> MONME</strong> is very light, only 3.75 grams. So, imagine your BOUND UP sore ARM. Now imagine the weight of the cloth that BOUND UP your ARM. Yep, you guessed it. It weighs one<strong> MONME</strong>.

"I get this confused with <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1792"">business/profession</a> (#1792 業). An<strong> occupation</strong> is something you can get after you leave the <em>schoolhouse</em> with a <em>backbone</em> of knowledge, but to get a profession you need to move on to higher education."	ATCHUNG!!! This keyword stands for <strong>Military<strong> occupation</strong></strong>, and not profession, as it could be (incorrectly) assumed from the primitives.

善		virtuous	<i>Sheep</i> . . . <i>horns</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>. Pay special attention to the writing of this character.		12	1112	1035	28	ゼン	よ.い、い.い、よ.く、よし.とする	"Imagine a priest's teaching: ""To achieve <strong>virtue</strong> one must first submit himself as a <em>sheep</em> to God's flock, rejecting the <em>horns</em> of Satan and resisting the <em>mouth</em> of Hell."	"To be<strong> virtuous</strong>, a good rule to follow is to put your <em>sheepishness</em> (discretion) over your <em>horns</em> (anger) before using your <em>mouth</em>. In other words, ""discretion is the better part of virtue""."	Sheep proves to be<strong> virtuous</strong> by bringing food to its hungry baby, the two little <em>horns</em> and open <em>mouth</em> that are waiting under it for food.	There once was a beautiful girl. So<strong> virtuous</strong> and chaste. One day, however, she got really <em>horny</em>. Unfortunately, the only living creature was a <em>sheep</em>.

Some people insist that the serving maids who bring in the<strong> dining tray</strong>s are especially <em>virtuous</em> and never let any man touch their <em>flesh</em>.	As VIRTUOUS cannibals, we serve FLESH on<strong> DINING TRAY</strong>S.

Vegetarians are <em>virtuous</em> because they never let any <em>meat</em> touch their<strong> dining tray</strong>. Note: also the counter for bowls (of rice) or pairs (of chopsticks); ーぜん.		
年		year	In an odd fashion, the kanji for <b>year</b> joins together the element for <i>horse</i>, on the top, and the right half of the element for <i>sunglasses</i>. Think of it as a <i>horse</i> wearing <i>sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out</i>. We will use this latter image again, so learn it now and save yourself the trouble later.		6	1114	1036	28	ネン	とし	A <em>horse</em> wears a pair of <em>sunglasses with one lens popped out</em> after a particularly raucous celebration to ring in the New<strong> Year</strong>.	"A <strong>horse</strong> wears a <strong>monocle</strong> for New<strong> Year</strong>s to appear dignified for the<strong> year</strong> of the horse. ――one lens = monocle, you will encounter this again in kanji like <a href=""../v4/1308.html"">descend</a> (#1308 降)."	Hint: A pirate horse?	The<strong> year</strong> of the <em>pirate horse</em>!!! Picture it on the zodiac calendar. A horse with an eye patch.	"NOTE: 舛 is actually a radical meaning dancing legs. Can't you see the legs twisted about a pole perhaps? I am uncertain why Heisig chose sunglasses.

夜		night	First of all, be sure not to confuse the connotations of <b>night</b> with those of <i>evening</i> (Frame 114) and <i>nightbreak</i> (Frame 30). Its elements: <i>top hat</i> . . . <i>person</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i> . . . <i>drop</i>.		8	1115	1037	28	ヤ	よ、よる	"Actually, the lower-right primitive isn't quite ""walking legs."" It's a little more like ""evening"" with an extra stroke across it (look up the stroke order). So, it helps me to see this kanji for<strong> night</strong> as: <em>evening</em> plus an extra stroke representing the tuxedo tails to match the <em>top hat</em> which my special <em>person</em> is wearing out on the town…"	Here we have <em>Mister T</em> sleepwalking, wearing a <em>top hat</em> as if he was the ambassador of the<strong> night</strong>, walking, and walking and walking on his tired <em>walking legs</em>, until he <em>drops</em> (back into his bed).	An elegant vampire. Going out in his<strong> night</strong> suit with a top hat, the creature looks like a person with long walking legs. The drop is the blood that the vampire seeks.	See this as an example of when the oldest profession in the world – prostitution – prefers to work. Even the wealthiest of gentleman in their <em>top hats</em> are ordinary <em>people</em>, and will not decline to deposit their <em>drops</em> between the <em>walking legs</em> of the streetwalkers out in the<strong> night</strong>.	Mr T was taking a stroll during the evening with his brand new top hat, and without even noticing, it turned from evening to<strong> night</strong> in a dash.		
液		fluid	Water . . . night.		11	1116	1038	28	エキ		A wet dream……..water<strong> fluid</strong> that comes out at night….	I imagined some kind of liquid (<em>water</em>) that was discovered on another planet. It solidifes during the day, and becomes<strong> fluid</strong> only at <em>night</em>, in the absence of light. The question is, could any lifeforms thrive in there ?	<em>water</em> at <em>night</em> => sexual<strong> fluid</strong>! エキ； 精液 せいえき　semen； 液晶 えきしょう　liquid crystal ( 画面 ).	Try not to drink too many<strong> FLUID</strong>S like WATER at NIGHT or you'll have to get up to pee.	Ninja's are<strong> fluid</strong> like <em>water</em> and they come out at <em>night</em>.

The <em>crowned sow</em> (we met her in <em>overpowering</em>) is standing atop her little mound of <em>earth</em> -<strong> hillock</strong> - the undisputed champeen of all the pigsty.	<em>Napoleon the Pig</em> (from Orwell's Animal Farm) crowns himself king of the farm standing on a little mound (hillock) of <em>earth</em>.	These <em>pigs</em> are searching for truffles in the<strong> hillock</strong>s.

幣		cash	Shredder . . . towel.		15	1118	1040	28	ヘイ	ぬさ	A counterfeiter is using a <em>shredder</em> to shred a <em>towel</em> in order to print up some<strong> cash</strong> (he needs some rag paper) .	"In order to create some <strong>cash</strong>, first you feed a <em>towel</em> through a <em>shredder</em> to get the raw materials. (""Paper"" money isn't plain paper; it's mostly linen.)."	(The <em>shredder</em> isn't a mechanical shredder but a little animal kept in servitude by the taskmaster. The <em>little</em> critter has a <em>little belt</em> around its neck which the <em>taskmaster</em> yanks when he has a document to shred).	<em>Shredder</em> from TMNT is the <em>taskmaster</em> who rules over the foot clan. He wears a <em>belt</em> and has <em>little</em> spikes both above it (on his head/arms) and below it (on his legs). Here, a hotel demands that <em>Shredder</em> pay them some<strong> cash</strong> after they found out that he shredded all of their <em>towels</em>!	The Shredder(from Teenage mutant Ninja Turtles) uses his towel as a whip and grabs your<strong> cash</strong> and disappears like all ninjas do…. (story for SHREDDER primitive: the droplets are the pieces of shredder paper flying around. The vertical line is the paper feeder. The belt is to squeeze and pack the shredded paper. The taskmaster is the person shredding illegal documents for fear of a lawsuit.).		
蔽		cover over	Flower . . . shredder.		16	1119	2358	28	ヘイ、ヘツ、フツ	おお.う、おお.い	You<strong> cover over</strong> the <em>shredder</em> with <em>flowers</em> when the FBI comes a-knockin'.	"<em>Shredder</em> is writing a anonymous ransom note to the police. ""Bring me one billion dollars or I'll destroy your city with my Foot Soldiers! Signed, <em>Shredder</em>."" …oops! This was supposed to be anonymous, but he signed his own name! He can't re-write it now, he spent all that time doing the letter in beautiful calligraphy. What to do? …Thinking fast, <em>Shredder</em> grabs a large <em>daisy</em> and some tape, and <strong>covers over</strong> his name, leaving only the ""-er."" Good thinking, <em>Shredder</em>!"	The <em>taskmaster</em> arranges <em>flowers</em> to<strong> cover over</strong> the <em>rags</em> she makes us clean with.	See why the FLOWERS keep on falling into the SHREDDER? You keep on forgetting to put the<strong> COVER OVER</strong> it. After you finished with it dont forget to put the<strong> COVER over</strong> it so that the FLOWERS wont fall into it again.	SHREDDER COVERED OVER himself with FLOWERS so that the TMNT would not find him.		
弊		abuse	Shredder . . . two hands.		15	1120	1041	28	ヘイ		You’ve heard of Edward Scissor hands? Well this is Medward Shredder Hands. Instead of nicely trimming your shrubs, he uses his TWO SHREDDER equipped HANDS to<strong> ABUSE</strong> your plants by shredding them into wood chips.	Mafioso abusing someone to get information. They use a shredder on both of his hands.	<em>Shredder</em> is <strong>abusing</strong> Bebop and Rocksteady by bitch-slapping them with <em>both his hands</em>.	Shoving someone's <em>hands</em> into a <em>shredder</em> surely counts as<strong> abuse</strong>.	This really refers to<strong> abuse</strong> in terms of bad habits. The taskmaster puts your two hands in the shredder when he catches you picking your nose again. That'll fix your bad habits!		
喚		yell	The <i>mouth</i> on the left is obvious. The rest is harder. Try this: <i>four St. Bernard dogs bound up</i> in a bunch. Together they should supply a clear enough portrait of a <b>yell</b>, provided you are careful to see all <i>four</i> of them.

I think of the sounds that would come from the mouths of the 4 dogs if they were bound up together. I'm imagining lots of yelping.	<strong>Yell</strong>? You mean, Old <strong>Yell</strong>er. Here, we see four <em>St Bernard dogs</em> all <strong>yell</strong>ing for a chance to play a part in Old <strong>Yell</strong>er. They're so loud that you have to <em>bound</em> them, and their <em>mouths</em>, up.	The musher<strong> yell</strong>s at the 4 dogs bound up to the dog sled to get them to run faster and cross the finish line first. (4 St Bernards bound up together makes a dog sled).	"<strong>Note:</strong> 奐 means ""clear; bright."" The keyword <a href=""../v4/20.html"">bright</a> (#20 明) is already used. However, among all the 3000 Kanjis presented by Heisig, the keyword <em>clear</em> alone is not used, so you might want to use it to refer to this radical. <strong>Story:</strong> Although I could not hear them, seeing their <em>mouth</em>es, it was <em>clear</em> to me that they are<strong> yell</strong>ing."	You have to<strong> yell</strong> really hard if you want the <em>four St. Bernard dogs</em> to pull the sled: they don't like being <em>bound up</em>.

I've seen this crazy thing with only <em>one mouth</em> that can<strong> dissolve</strong> up to <em>4 nails</em> and an <em>insect</em> at the same time. Sweet! (It's a venus flytrap, btw).

Giraffes, elephants, zebras, rhinos…	Don't confuse with revolve or axis! Think of<strong> rotation</strong> as a<strong> rotation</strong> of animals in the <em>zoo</em> - some are on display (in<strong> rotation</strong>), some are in cages in the back (out of<strong> rotation</strong>). The ones currently in<strong> rotation</strong> (on display) are advertised with a large <em>banner</em>.	I had trouble remember this with previous zoo-banner-rotation stories, so here is something a bit more vivid: The future of ZOO technology: There is a giant Ferris Wheel-type contraption with individual plastic cages, each with an animal that ROTATES every 10 minutes. It's built half-way into the ground, can you envision it? The lazy people who watch wouldn't know what animal was what without the colorful BANNERS that accompany each cage.

旅		trip	Let the last 4 strokes, which are also the concluding strokes to the character for <i>garment</i>, represent a <i>rag</i> as its primitive meaning.

A<strong> grant</strong> may seem like easy money, but then the kanji would be out of order. So you must justify the<strong> grant</strong> <em>money</em> first, then it will be <em>easy</em>.	MONEY that's EASY is a<strong> GRANT</strong>.

If you live in Japan, you are only too familiar with the helpful little man who assists you in getting out of every parking lot or parking garage, standing at the exit, waving his flag to make traffic<strong> yield</strong> to you.	The yellow flag at the exit indicates one should<strong> yield</strong> to oncoming traffic and pedestrians.	When you<strong> YIELD</strong> in a battle, you raise the FLAG of surrender then EXIT the battlefield.

Mark the holes where <em>rain water</em> can<strong> leak</strong> through with little <em>flags</em>.	When you want to take a<strong> LEAK</strong> in Japan, first you turn the lock on your stall so the little <em>FLAG</em> shows red, and then you push the button on the armrest of the fancy-schmancy toilet that makes the <em>RAIN</em> sounds, and only then can you finally be allowed to let some <em>WATER</em> out, yourself.

The image that keeps coming to me is of the giant mechanical<strong> printing</strong> presses. The <em>cloth</em>-based material is coming off the roll like a flag and then, after<strong> printing</strong>, gets cut into sheets by <em>saber</em>-like cutting tools.	You're short of paper, so you try<strong> printing</strong> on a towel. Your unhappy printer shows you a red flag but when you show it your sword it becomes very obedient and starts<strong> printing</strong>. Awful quality, but the printer did what it could…	Modern laser printers can print on flags and towels with saber-like precision.	"Before the invention of the<strong> printing</strong> press, there were many failures, such as the peeing press. Yep, having people <em>pee</em> onto <em>towels</em> that had letters cut into them with <em>sabers</em> just didn't work very well.. (note: I use ""pee"" for the ""flag"" primitive."		
尺		shaku	"The key word <b>shaku</b> has actually come into English in the word <i><b>shaku</b>hachi</i>, the ancient Japanese flute that measured ""one <b>shaku</b> and eight <i>sun</i>"" (the ""sun"" being about an inch in length).

Let the final sweeping stroke be like a tape measure added to the <i>flag</i>."	* As a primitive, this will mean the <i>shakuhachi</i> flute.	4	1151	1070	29	シャク		Slang for blowjob and that's priceless for stories…but also the character looks like the letter R which I think of as standing for RULER (12 inches) other meanings include: rule, measure, length.	"Since this is SLANG for BLOW JOB and since it looks like an ""R"", let's have the primitive be the R in BROW JOB. :)."	R-rated term for blowjob.	For the primitive meaning let the<strong> shaku</strong>hachi flute be the magic flute of yore. (Apparantly for a woman 'to play the<strong> shaku</strong>hachi' is a euphamism for oral sex, if this helps with the character).	Slang for blowjob… looks like a person with a giant mouth.

That's not ice…it's my last drops and I'm<strong> exhaust</strong>ed! ;).	"This old Japanese man totally<strong> exhaust</strong>ed himself giving a <em>winter</em>-time performance of <em>shakuhachi</em>. That <em>winter</em> was so cold, the <em>shakuhachi</em> was getting clogged with <em>ice</em> as the man was playing.

Meanings: to<strong> exhaust</strong>; to be<strong> exhaust</strong>ed; to use up completely; to use (exhaust) all one's strength (in the performance of one's duties)."	You can imagine how<strong> exhaust</strong>ing it would be to play a <em>shakuhachi</em> filled with <em>ice</em>. It would<strong> exhaust</strong> your supply of breath (and probably patience).

You all know that 'shakuhachi' is a slang word for blowjob, right? In this kanji you got a job as a TRANSLATOR for Japanese porno movies.

"Imagine some weird guy who only communicates via <em>shakuhachi</em>, so he always brings along a translator to<strong> translate</strong> his <em>shakuhachi</em> sounds into <em>words</em>. ""Excuse me, do you know where the library is?"" ""♫♪♫♫♪♫♪."" ""It's just down the street on the left.""."	A true story I always think of: My friend was working as an ALT in a slightly bad Japanese high school. One day, a girl approached him in the corridor and checked nobody was watching. Saying nothing, she pointed at his crotch and then gestured to her opened mouth, smiled and promptly ran off, leaving him horrified… <em>Shakuhachi</em> in any language needs no <em>words</em> to<strong> translate</strong> I guess…	Words R us- translating company.

In a Zelda game, you can warp to the <strong>daytime</strong> if you play your <em>shakuhachi</em> to bring about <em>nightbreak</em>… or your ocarina if you don't have a shakuhachi.	A<strong> daytime</strong> <em>blowjob</em>? Can't you at least wait until <em>nightbreak</em>?

A Japanese<strong> door</strong> has a noren, a <em>flag</em> hanging from a <em>rod</em>. (I give this primitive the meaning of a noren-covered<strong> door</strong>).	Their is only ONE FLAG on<strong> DOOR</strong>s in Japan. The Japanese FLAG of course!	If you are too poor to afford a<strong> door</strong>, you can just hang a <em>single flag</em> instead.

The<strong> shoulder</strong> is <em>part of the body</em> you use to push through the noren in a <em>doorway</em>. I was having trouble with positioning of the primitives until I tweaked shaydwyrm's story slightly. If you think of pushing through a noren, this makes sense as a pictograph. The noren hangs from above, and you push through it from below.	A part of the body I always seem to bump against the door.	See those pieces of <em>meat</em>, on either sides of the <em>door</em> frame ?

顧		look back	Employ . . . head.		21	1165	1084	29	コ	かえり.みる	I was EMPLOYED to give HEAD…when I<strong> look back</strong>, maybe that was not a wise career move.	The people we employ are always turning their heads to<strong> look back</strong>. They don't want to be caught playing solitare on company time.	It's sad to see the <em>turkeys</em><strong> look back</strong> one last time before entering the <em>door</em> of the slaughterhouse and losing their <em>heads</em>.	"Think ""Spirited Away"". Chihiro is told not to<strong> LOOK BACK</strong> at the magical bathhouse, else she will revert to the EMPLOY of the witch with an enormous HEAD."	Looking back, employing that turkey was our smartest move in ages. It became head of the company in no time!		
啓		disclose	Door . . . taskmaster . . . mouth.		11	1166	1085	29	ケイ	ひら.く、さと.す	Behind closed DOORS, the TASKMASTER tortures to get prisoners to open their MOUTHS and<strong> DISCLOSE</strong> information.	You signed a non-<strong>disclosure</strong> agreement with the <em>taskmaster</em> but you opened your mouth as soon as you got out the <em>door</em>!	It's best not to<strong> disclose</strong> what you were forced to do with your <em>mouth</em> behind closed <em>doors</em> for your <em>taskmaster</em>.	Before they go out of the <em>door</em>, the <em>taskmaster</em> makes everyone sign non-<strong>disclosure</strong> forms to keep on top of the possibility that they might open their <em>mouths</em>.	A closed <em>door</em> refuses to<strong> disclose</strong> (dis-close) whatever is happening behind, so someone asked the <em>taskmistress</em> to whip the <em>door</em>, and force it to reveal/disclose what is going on behind. The <em>door</em> gives up (who can resist the <em>taskmistress</em>, hehe) and<strong> disclose</strong>s the information by way of a <em>mouth</em> that appears, just like that (even in imaginary world, doors need a <em>mouth</em> to talk).		
示		show	Although the elements <i>two</i> and <i>little</i> are available for the using, it may be easier to remember this character as a picture of an altar. Something placed atop the altar is put on <b>show</b> for all to see.	* As a primitive, this kanji means <i>altar</i>. At the left, the abbreviated form that this element takes is made by chopping the <i>altar</i> in half and leaving only one dot behind to represent the right side. The new appearance of this primitive form, ネ, should be kept distinct from that for <i>cloak</i>, identical except for the one final short stroke.	5	1167	1086	30	ジ、シ	しめ.す	A boy made an <em>altar</em>, but he's afraid to<strong> show</strong> it to God because he thinks it's <em>two little</em>.	"""I'll<strong> SHOW</strong> you mine if you<strong> show</strong> me yours!"", she said. I did & she scoffed because it was <em>TWO LITTLE</em>."	I give this form a primitive of <em>EVIL ALTAR</em>. Imagine a black stone altar used for satanic rituals. I give the left radical form a primitive of <em>CHURCH ALTAR</em>. Imagine a beautiful cathedral altar.	Unrelated: Frankly, I found Chapter 30 BORING. (I guess I was spoiled with Mr. T.) To jazz up the excitement, this ENTIRE chapter is all about one very crazy religion that exists today (in your imagination). What are the specifics? That's for you to find out. The clues? The next 39 kanji. Just look at some of the keywords: Altar, oil, sleeve, collar, speakth, naked!!! Be sure to give altar it's own meaning inside the cult you're creating.	A picture of an altar. <em>Two small things</em> are placed on it to<strong> show</strong> them off (I imagine two watches covered in diamonds).		
礼		salutation	This key word refers to the polite bows and ceremonious forms of <b>salutation</b> so important in Japanese culture. Its elements: <i>altar</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i>.		5	1168	1087	30	レイ、ライ		"""Indy, my friend, you must be very careful! If you approach the <strong>altar</strong> and do not give the proper <em>salutation</em> a large <strong>fishhook</strong> will rip you away""."	You should <em>fish hook</em> (bend/bow) your body before an <em>altar</em> as a form of<strong> salutation</strong> to God/gods.	<strong>SALUTATION</strong> (a hand salute in this case) was given to the ALTAR by a veteran with a HOOK for his hand. Just keep that mental picture and you own this kanji.	This cult has a really dumb<strong> salutation</strong>. They form sort of a <em>'fishhook'</em> on their foreheads with their thumb and index finger. They do it whenever they come near the <em>altar</em>. They say it's 'L' for 'Luck', I say it's 'L' for 'Losers'.	Salute the church <em>altar</em> with a bow (bend yourself like a <em>fishhook</em>).		
祥		auspicious	Altar . . . sheep.		10	1169	1088	30	ショウ	さいわ.い、きざ.し、よ.い、つまび.らか	Bringing a <em>sheep</em> to sacrifice on the <em>altar</em> was a sign of an<strong> auspicious</strong> life. The poor could only afford a pigeon, the more<strong> auspicious</strong> an expensive <em>sheep</em> for an offering.	On this <strong>ewe-spicious</strong> occasion, you sacrifice a <em>sheep</em> at the <em>altar</em>. —— Sorry, but I really need more than generic altar sacrifices to connect keywords to stories. Sometimes an egregious pun is the only way.	"Once a year, the people pray for a sign from the gods. If the gods are pleased, they send down a <em>sheep</em> to the <em>altar</em>. The people see this as an<strong> auspicious</strong> gift; the wool and milk from this sheep is considered holy. But the gods think of it as a witty joke, since it's just a metaphor for the people following ancient rituals like blind sheep. Continued in <a href=""../v4/1291.html"">calamity</a> (#1291 禍)."	It's an<strong> auspicious</strong> sign when you go to the <em>altar</em> and the <em>sheep</em> is already beside it, ready to go.	"<strong>Auspicious</strong> (adj): contraction of ""Australia"" and ""delicious""; a sheep is placed on an ""australian altar"", or ""barbie"", on an<strong> auspicious</strong> occasion to celebrate."		
祝		celebrate	Altar . . . teenager.		9	1170	1089	30	シュク、シュウ	いわ.う	When Japanese people turn 20 they usually visit the <em>altar</em> at their local shrine and<strong> celebrate</strong> no longer being a <em>teenager</em>.	It's a Bar Mitzvah. At the <em>altar</em>, the <em>teenager</em> is singing in his awful, mid-puberty voice. We'll all<strong> celebrate</strong> when that part is over!	<em>Teenagers</em> <strong>celebrating</strong> at the church <em>altar</em>. (Maybe they just finished RTK).	This <em>teenager</em> is at the <em>altar</em>, about to<strong> celebrate</strong> the sacrament of Confirmation.	Coming of Age Day ( 成人の日 , seijin no hi) is a Japanese holiday held annually on the second Monday of January to<strong> celebrate</strong> those who have turned 20 years old. In this kanji we see someone going to the <em>altar</em> to<strong> celebrate</strong> no longer being a <em>teenager</em>.		
福		blessing	Altar . . . wealth.		13	1171	1090	30	フク		This recalls the selling of indulgences in the history of the Church (As an aside, Protestantism began as a protest of this practice). Basically, one gave <em>wealth</em> to the <em>altar</em> (i.e. priest) and received a <em>blessing</em>. If you prefer a Jewish version, think of the donation (<em>wealth</em>) that is expected when you're called to the ark (<em>altar</em> in the kanji) to give a<strong> blessing</strong> over the torah.	Put all your <em>wealth</em> on the church <em>altar</em> and receive one<strong> blessing</strong>. (You stand up out of your wheelchair or something.).	Wow, this is Scientology put into a kanji. In the Scientology faith the <em>wealthiest</em> members have the highest status in the Church. So basically, the <em>wealthiest</em> person that puts the most money on the <em>alter</em> receives the most<strong> blessing</strong>s….(not really, from what I've heard, the more money you give the better parking spot you get….).	When you pray at the <em>altar</em> be sure to count your <em>wealth </em> as a<strong> blessing</strong>.	This illustrates the idea of tithing… thankful for God's <strong>blessing</strong>s, you give back a tenth of the <em>wealth</em> He has given you at the <em>altar</em>.		
祉		welfare	Altar . . . footprint.		8	1172	1091	30	シ		And in front of every <em>altar</em>, she <em>stopped</em> to pray for the<strong> welfare</strong> of the others.	Religious Republicans regularly go to the <em>altar</em> to pray for a <em>stop</em> to<strong> welfare</strong>.	I pray at the <em>altar</em> everyday that they don't <em>stop</em> my<strong> welfare</strong> checks. (A quick mnemonic is better for this one).	Marxist belief: To improve general<strong> welfare</strong>, the influence of the <em>altar</em> must be <em>stop</em>ped. Maybe the Marxists had a point…. (Mnemonic:<strong> Welfare</strong> = <em>Stop</em> the <em>altar</em>) 福祉 (ふくし):<strong> welfare</strong>.	"I remember this one with a political idea … don't read if you're easily offended. Ironically, many of the people on<strong> Welfare</strong> in the USA are the super-religious type (the sort that regularly visit their respective <em>altars</em>) in the American South, and tend to all have that infamous <em>""Footprints""</em> poem (where God carries you across the beach) hanging in their living rooms. These people tend to vote conservatively (politicians that oppose federal<strong> welfare</strong>), and thus … against their own best interests."		
社		company	<i>Altar</i> . . . <i>soil</i>. The <b>company</b> referred to here is that of the modern business world.		7	1173	1092	30	シャ	やしろ	When you enter a Japanese<strong> company</strong> it's like you join a cult… your workdesk becomes your altar and you worship the very soil the office is built on.	Some Japanese <strong>companies</strong>, including Toyota, have a Shinto <em>shrine</em> on their <em>grounds</em> to bring luck and prosperity to the<strong> company</strong> and its employees.	If a<strong> company</strong> is built on <em>land</em> near the <em>altar</em>, it is believed that it will become successful.	The Japanese treat their<strong> company</strong> like a shrine and the<strong> company</strong> treat them like dirt.	An <em>altar</em> was bulldozed and filled with <em>soil</em> as the foundation for a new<strong> company</strong> building.		
視		inspection	Altar . . . see.		11	1174	1093	30	シ	み.る	"The beaurocracy in Japan is such that even altars need to be<strong> inspection</strong> approved. A little man with glasses comes once a year to give the <em>altar</em> a ""visual once over"" as he calls it (perhaps checking for unauthorised symbology?)."	"[inspection; regard as; see; look at] <strong>Inspection</strong>: you 示 <a href=""../v4/1086.html"">show</a> (#1086 示) and someone else 見 <a href=""../v4/57.html"">see</a> (#57 見)."	(Thanks to Ricardo) There's an<strong> inspection</strong> in the church. You <em>show</em> the altar, and the inspector <em>sees</em> if it's okay or not.	At the <em>altar</em>, god <em>looks</em> at you, in an<strong> inspection</strong> of your soul.	The stone cutter inspects the altars with his keen eyesight for details. The surface must be smooth as ice, not a blemish must be seen. Very well, let me see the next stone altar.		
奈		Nara	We choose the city of <b>Nara</b> as the key word in this case because this kanji, frequently used in proper names, appears in <b>Nara</b>; and also because of <b>Nara's</b> famed religious monuments, which help us with the primitives: <i>St. Bernard dog</i> . . . <i>altar</i>.		8	1175	1094	30	ナ、ナイ、ダイ	いかん、からなし	It's beautiful place, but the dark side of<strong> Nara</strong> is that they sacrifice <em>St. Bernards</em> on <em>evil altars</em> every night after the tourists leave!	<strong>Nara</strong> is just a <em>big</em> <em>show</em> for tourists.	There is a BIG ALTAR in<strong> NARA</strong>. (really! :-) ).	<strong>Nara</strong> is famous for its deers running freely everywhere. To avoid any accidents, Shepperd dogs are put on to the temple's altars to stop the deer from entering the temples.	Toudaiji Temple in<strong> Nara</strong> is one heck of a <em>big altar</em>.		
尉		military officer	Flag . . . altar . . . glue.		11	1176	1095	30	イ、ジョウ		Of course it had to be the<strong> military officer</strong>'s idea to <em>glue</em> a <em>national flag</em> to the <em>altar</em> he's stationed at.	Perhaps you have heard about Koizumis controversial visits at the Yasukuni war memorial shrine. It is the japanese flag waving above a small stone altar. A<strong> military officer</strong> keeps watch here night and day, to honor the dead war heroes, as if he is glued to the ground.	Only way I remember this is think of a<strong> MILITARY OFFICER</strong> standing next to a FLAG draped ALTAR (well, the coffin is by the altar) as if GLUED to it. Might hurt if you think that GLUED primitive looks like the<strong> MILITARY OFFICER</strong> is saluting the FLAG draped ALTAR, with a slight tear coming from the eye.	<strong>Military officer</strong>s glue their flags to the altars of the countries they've conquered.	The<strong> military officer</strong> is even patriotic when he watches tv. Whenever there's a <em>flag</em> on the <em>show</em>, he's just <em>glue</em>d to the set.		
慰		consolation	Military officer . . . heart.		15	1177	1096	30	イ	なぐさ.める、なぐさ.む	A <em>military officer</em> must offer<strong> consolation</strong> to the <em>hearts</em> of the families of his fallen men.	"This Kanji appears in the word 慰安婦 いあんふ, which was what the infamous WW II ""comfort women"" were called in Japanese. The story goes something like this: As a way of providing<strong> consolation</strong> to battle-weary, <em>heartsick military officers and soldiers</em>, the Japanese set up comfort stations (brothels) for their servicemen. (Just to be clear: this is not an endorsement of the practice, just a way to remember the Kanji.)."	The MILITARY OFFICER is given a Purple HEART by the army as<strong> consolation</strong> for the wounds he received in the line of duty.	"The <em>military officer</em> consoles the parents: ""Well, your son did not win the war. He died. But, as a<strong> consolation</strong> prize, you get his <em>heart</em>!"" TA-DAAA!! ""Thanks for playing, folks!"" (cue screaming)."	"""My time in the army was complete misery."" - ""Well if it's any<strong> consolation</strong> that bastard <em>military officer</em> had a <em>heart</em> attack.""."		
款		goodwill	Samurai . . . altar . . . yawning.		12	1178	1097	30	カン		Samuari, altar, yawn The samurai is on the altar, preaching about<strong> goodwill</strong>. The audience just yawns however, they want to see the man fight!	A <em>samurai</em>'s <em>show</em> of<strong> goodwill</strong> is never <em>lacking</em>.	For better remembering the placement of the eleements: The <em>samurai</em> kneels before the altar at his wedding ceremony, when some of the attendants lets out a big yawn. He is a kind man and for the day his <em>goodwill</em> benefits everyone. No beheadings.	<strong>Goodwill</strong> is something that <em>samurais</em> <em>show</em> and other warriors just <em>lack</em>.	<strong>Goodwill</strong> Hunting, the Japanese version. Will is played by Toshio Mifune, a former <em>SAMURAI</em> who dreams of attending MIT. However he <em>LACKS</em> confidence and instead works polishing <em>ALTARS</em> at a nearby temple.		
禁		prohibition	Grove . . . altar.		13	1179	1098	30	キン		"Similar to radical tyro's story. If you live in Japan, your main exposure to this kanji is probably ""no smoking"" signs. So I imagine the government enacting a<strong> prohibition</strong> of tobacco, and burning whole groves of tobacco plants on an altar (the altar of public health, or self-righteousness, if you will)."	"Hidden in a <em>grove</em> was a church with a secret <em>altar</em> that was stocked full of <strong>prohibited</strong> alcohol during the American<strong> prohibition</strong> period of 1920-1933. A local registered himself as a mininster of this <em>altar</em> so he could stock <strong>prohibited</strong> alcohol ""for sacremental purposes"" and share it with his <em>kin</em> (きん)."	Placing trees on this alter is prohibited.	When Chirstianity was prohibited and the christians were being chased in Japan they had to hide their altars under the groves.	During<strong> prohibition</strong>, people drank hidden in <em>groves</em> so that they wouldn't be <em>shown</em> drinking in public.		
襟		collar	Cloak . . . prohibition.		18	1180	1099	30	キン	えり	A<strong> collar</strong> is the part of your <em>cloak</em> that, if tightened too tight, will <em>prohibit</em> breathing.	<strong>Collar</strong>s are <em>prohibited</em> from wizarding <em>cloaks</em>. Blood purists say they're too muggle.	Dress code: all <em>cloaks</em> without<strong> collar</strong>s are <em>prohibited</em>.	In some future anti-Catholic dystopia, a <em>prohibition</em> against <strong>collars</strong> has been enacted, so Catholic priests often conceal them (or <em>cloak</em> them) underneath their <em>cloaks</em>. Imagine a cloaked Catholic priest walking down the street when he sees a police officer approaching him, and the priest nervously tightens his <em>cloak</em> to ensure his<strong> collar</strong> isn't seen.	"Popping the<strong> collar</strong> on any <em>cloak</em> is strictly <em>prohibited</em> because doing so will make you look like an enormous douchebag. <em>Fun fact</em>: the phrase ""pop [one's]<strong> collar</strong>"" is <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%8C%E8%A5%9F%E3%82%92%E7%AB%8B%E3%81%A6%E3%82%8B%E3%80%8D"">「襟を立てる」</a> in Japanese."		
宗		religion	House . . . altar.		8	1181	1100	30	シュウ、ソウ	むね	I never really did figure out what<strong> religion</strong> my host family was - all I knew was that they kept an <em>altar</em> in their <em>home</em>.	All the<strong> RELIGION</strong>S have their own temples, which are <strong>houses</strong> where they place their <strong>altars</strong>.	You can discover a japanese family<strong> religion</strong> by observing their <em>house altar</em>.	We have an altar in our HOUSE to SHOW our<strong> religion</strong>.	A <em>house</em> with an <em>altar</em>? Perhaps they practice a<strong> religion</strong>.		
崇		adore	Mountain . . . religion.		11	1182	1101	30	スウ	あが.める	In ancient Greece, it was the religion of the time to<strong> adore</strong> the gods who live on Mount Olympus.	I would<strong> adore</strong> the religious people if they just went and threw themselves off a mountain top.	Several kanji become their 'greater' version when you add 山 on top ( 風 becomes 嵐 , 石 becomes 岩 ). Thus, <em>religion</em> becomes <strong>adoration</strong>.	"The annoying woman from Los Angeles says ""oh I absolutely<strong> adore</strong> those cute little mountain religions, like tibetan buddhism, they shave their cute little heads and wear those bright pretty robes, so adorable.""."	I<strong> adore</strong> <em>mountains</em> over <em>religion</em>.		
祭		ritual	<i>Flesh</i> . . . <i>crotch</i> . . . <i>altar</i>. Note how the second element is cut short, giving a tent-like effect to the character.		11	1183	1102	30	サイ	まつ.る、まつ.り、まつり	A<strong> ritual</strong> such as a circumcision: a small piece of flesh from the crotch is left on the altar.	There are many famous penis <strong>matsuri</strong>s(festivals) in Japan. The<strong> ritual</strong>s of these festivals involve placing the <em>flesh</em> of the <em>crotch</em> on an <em>altar</em>.	まつり（ 祭り ）Ritual nude dances (nothing but flesh) involving lots of pelvic thrusts before the altars of ancient Japan. Now they're nothing but festivals, but back in the day they were<strong> ritual</strong>s. Most Japanese festivals have a circle dance, just imagine all the old people doing the except same dance but in the buff, wrinkly flesh flapping in the wind and all. Remembered. Unfortunately, perhaps forever.	This kanji is used for <strong>festivals</strong>. [Flesh from one leg … show] I think of those sexy high slit skirts, the ones that let you see the leg of its wearer.	The top part of this kanji I memorize as <em>circumcision</em>. - - - - - - - – - - - - - - - - - In an ancient<strong> ritual</strong>, people are <em>shown</em> how to <em>circumsize</em> their newborns.		
察		guess	"""<b>Guess</b>"" here has the sense of a measured conjecture. Its elements: <i>house</i> . . . <i>ritual</i>."		14	1184	1103	30	サツ		I have an informed<strong> guess</strong> about whose <em>house</em> the dark <em>rituals</em> are performet at.	Police ( 警察 ）drive around a street at night trying to<strong> guess</strong> whose house is having a matsuri indoors after complaints from the neighbours.	For our child's circumcision (the <em>ritual</em>) we invited a rabbi to our <em>house</em>. We didn't know it at the time, but he was blind, and he had to<strong> guess</strong> which little squishy thing was the baby's penis.	The POLICE had enough evidence, so they were able to make an informed<strong> GUESS</strong> as to which HOUSE the dark RITUALS were being performed in.	"In our <em>house</em> we have a <em>ritual</em>. When something happens someone says ""Guess what happened."" We ask for some sort of vague hint, but get ""no, go on,<strong> guess</strong>!"" Asking what sort of thing it's about, news, music, catastrophe, just gets ""no, you have to<strong> guess</strong>"". It takes quite a long time to find out what's happened. It's a very annoying ritual."		
擦		grate	Fingers . . . guess.		17	1185	1104	30	サツ	す.る、す.れる、-ず.れ、こす.る、こす.れる	If you mis-guess the cheese you'll<strong> grate</strong> your fingers on the cheese-grater (happens to me all the time).	Ouch! <em>Guess</em> how many <em>fingers</em> I just<strong> grate</strong>d in the<strong> grate</strong>r? (Edit: OR: Ouch! <em>Guess</em> what I just<strong> grate</strong>d in the<strong> grate</strong>r? – my <em>finger</em>!).	When you<strong> grate</strong> something you have to <em>guess</em> where your <em>fingers</em> are so you don't hurt yourself.	It was a cruel form of torture. He would<strong> grate</strong> cheese and by the smell make me guess what sort of cheese it was. If my guess was wrong, he would<strong> grate</strong> one of my fingers. Which is how I know how pretty much every cheese smells now, although I don't have many working fingers left.	"The meaning of this kanji is more like ""rub, scour, scratch, or scrape."" Story: Frustratedly trying to solve a math equation on the classroom chalkboard, the student made a sound that would really<strong> GRATE</strong> on everyone's nerves. She would<strong> GRATE</strong> her FINGERnails on the chalkboard as she GUESSED at the next step in solving the equation."		
由		wherefore	"The ""<b>wherefore</b>"" of this kanji explains the reason or origin of a thing. It does this graphically by depicting a seed in a <i>rice field</i> sending up a single sprout, which is the whole why and <b>wherefore</b> of the seed's falling in the earth and dying. (When the <i>flower</i> appears, you will recall from frame 249, we have a full <i>seedling</i>.)"	* As a primitive, in conformity to the explanation above, this kanji will be taken to mean <i>shoot</i> or <i>sprout</i>.	5	1186	1105	30	ユ、ユウ、ユイ	よし、よ.る	"""<strong>Wherefore</strong> art thou, <em>Sprouteo</em>?"" (Juliet has fallen in love with a brussel sprout) (OR: A brussel sprout has fallen from Juliet's dinner plate and rolled off)."	"""Cogito <strong>ergo</strong> sum.""<strong> Wherefore</strong> is a bad choice here for two reasons. For one, it's often mistranslated as ""where"" when in fact it's an urge to know a cause or reason; and two, because this kanji represents the reason, not the urge. [A thought <em>sprouts</em> from my <em>brain</em>. I think, <strong>therefore</strong> I am.]."	"Errata: Stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. The vertical stroke is #3. (story: dingomick)."	"""<strong>Wherefore</strong> art thou Romeo?"" says Juliet on her balcony as she plucks brussel sprouts instead of rose petals. (This takes on the primitive of the much more memorable <em>BRUSSEL SPROUT</em>)."	<strong>Wherefore</strong> art thou, Romeo. He's in the <em>rice field</em>. You can see his hair sticking up above the rice. New Primitive: Romeo.

In a rather surprising scientific breakthrough, genetically modified <em>Brussel sprouts</em> (which have become extremely absorbative), are thrown in the <em>water</em> to suck up<strong> oil</strong> spills.	<strong>oil</strong> is the most valuable <em>liquid</em> to <em>sprout</em> from the earth.

"Hahaha, the image of walking into a <em>house</em> and finding a sea of <em>brussel sprouts</em> floating<strong> mid-air</strong> is enough for me to remember. Maybe there's a magician in the kitchen shouting a reassuring ""Don't mind the <em>sprouts</em>!""."	This one doesn't help me very much but some of my mates found it helpful: Jack's beanstalk <em>sprouted</em> up, he climbed up it and found a <em>house</em> floating in<strong> mid-air</strong>.	With new <em>houses</em> <em>sprouting</em> up everwhere,<strong> mid-air</strong> collisions are becoming more common as airplanes have to avoid the new structures.

A Japanese man ordered some Brussel <em>sprouts</em> from Belgium.

The Germans manufactured so many <em>cars</em> during World War II that it was almost as if they were <em>sprouting</em> from the factories of the<strong> Axis</strong>.	Left side is the car, right side is a zoomed in picture of the car showing the detail of the axle/axis.	"George W. Bush placed a great deal of Middle Eastern countries in his ""<strong>Axis</strong> of Evil"" … perhaps because that region is the <em>sprouting origin</em> of what we have to put into our <em>cars</em> (let's bring back the electric car, eh?)."	James Bond has guns that <em>sprout</em> from the wheel <strong>axes</strong> of his <em>car</em>.		
甲		armor	This kanji reverses the element for <i>sprout</i>, giving the image of roots being sent down into the earth by a seed planted in the <i>rice field</i>. From there you must invent a connection to the keyword, <b>armor</b>.	"* The primitive meaning is <i>roots</i>. Important to that word is the image of ""pushing downwards,"" as <i>roots</i> do."	5	1194	1113	30	コウ、カン、カ	きのえ	"Funny.. this appeared to me as a pictograph of a samurai's<strong> armor</strong>. Then I looked up images of the samurai<strong> armor</strong> and it is not even remotely similar. Then I realised it looks in fact like the belly of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I somehow associated with the samurai<strong> armor</strong> because of the ""turtle samurai"" that appeared earlier. Fits me. The bit that pokes down is to protect the genitals, I guess."	It looks like a bird's eye view of a tank (modern<strong> armor</strong>).	Pictograph. Kendo visor with chin guard.	Armour weighs you down like you’re rooted to the ground.	Looks like an<strong> armor</strong>ed helmet. You have the part that protects the <em>brain</em> and a little line beneath that acts as a nose guard.		
押		push	<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>roots</i>. Compare and contrast with <i>pluck</i> (Frame 1187).		8	1195	1114	30	オウ	お.す、お.し-、お.っ-、お.さえる、おさ.える	<strong>Push</strong> the <em>roots</em> down, instead of plucking the seedling.	Use your <em>fingers</em> to make sure the <em>roots</em> of your plant are deep underground by <strong>pushing</strong> them down, down, down.	<strong>Push</strong> the button with your <em>finger</em> and get <em>root</em> beer!	"For those who liked the ""bird's eye view of the tank"" imagine a tank that has its tracks stuck in the sand. The big green machine is extremely hot from the desert sun as well as the heat its engine has created. With that picture in mind, this Kanji depicts what happens next when the soldiers get around the back of the tank and have to<strong> push</strong> it with their fingers because the surface is too hot for them to put their hands on."	You are wearing your cool new <em>Ninja Turtles Shell Armour</em> and you realize that there's a little button with a <em>finger</em> symbol on it, inviting you to<strong> push</strong> it. You<strong> push</strong> it, and the front wall of the shell <strong>push</strong>es out violently. You've learned a new attack - this isn't just a defense tool anymore, you can now run around and<strong> push</strong> people around for no reason! Cool!		
岬		headland	Like the <i>cape</i> (Frame 164) and the <i>promontory</i> (Frame 840), the <b>headland</b> refers to a jut of land. Its elements: <i>mountain</i> . . . <i>roots</i>.		8	1196	1115	30	コウ	みさき	A<strong> headland</strong> is a <em>mountain</em> that is firmly <em>rooted</em> despite being surrounded on 3 sides by water. (Just like your head is a mountain surrounded by air on 3 sides, a<strong> headland</strong>!).	<strong>Headland</strong>s are natural forts; in fact, once men build castles on them, they become <em>armoured mountains</em>. (Gibralter, for example, is basically an <em>armoured mountain</em>).	A <em>mountain</em> that has been <em>pushed</em> into the sea.	The<strong> headland</strong> is <em>mountain</em>ous terrain that provides a natural fortification (or <em>armour</em>) against sea-borne invasion. 岬 (みさき) : cape (on coast).	"Forget confusing the meanings (<strong>headland</strong>, <a href=""../v4/778.html"">promontory</a> (#778 崎), <a href=""../v4/153.html"">cape</a> (#153 埼)) they are synonyms, no way around that. Luckily, all three seem to be used in names most. I used: The<strong> headland</strong> or <strong>head</strong> of the <strong>land</strong> is obviously the part of the land that is placed highest, in the same way our head is highest on the body. <em>Mountains</em> are the <strong>head</strong>s of the <strong>land</strong>s they have planted their <em>roots</em> into."		
挿		insert	<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>thousand</i> . . . <i>roots</i>. Observe how the writing order does not follow the elements in order, because the final stroke is used for two different elements.		10	1197	1116	30	ソウ	さ.す、はさ.む	A rice farmer's delicate <em>fingers</em> have<strong> insert</strong>ed <em>1,000 rooted</em> seedlings into his field.	Imagine a crazy japanese hentai: multiple fingers and <em>thousand</em> of <em>root</em>-like tentacles are<strong> insert</strong>ing themselves in… well, I think you can fill the rest.	Before you <em>push</em> the button for the <em>ginseng root</em> tea, you must<strong> insert</strong> <em>1000</em> yen.	<em>Fingers</em>, the thief, is trying to get money using my ATM card. After <strong>insert</strong>ing it in the ATM, he tried <em>1000 times</em> to <em>push</em> the right buttons. And got my pin right number on the last try! Notice the long vertical stroke done last!	"Weird arcade machine this one. Instead of reading ""insert coin"", it reads ""<strong>insert</strong> <em>1,000 roots</em>"". I hope you can play until your <em>fingers</em> get sore, for that price!"		
申		speaketh	"The olde English is used here to indicate a humble form of the third person singular of the verb ""to speak."" It is written by a <i>tongue wagging in the mouth</i> with a <i>walking stick</i> rammed through it and coming out at both ends."	"* While this kanji has obvious affinities to the ""seed"" group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the <i>monkey</i> (the one who <i>speaketh</i> no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take <i>monkey</i> as its primitive meaning."	5	1198	1117	30	シン	もう.す、もう.し-、さる	"I imagine thomeone who can not pronounth the ""s"" and<strong> speaketh</strong> like thith becauth they have a <em>cane</em> in their <em>mouth</em>."

The way I keep it sorted out is that this one is used in ""moshi moshi"" when answering the phone, similar to the way an American would say ""hello, this is X <strong>speaking</strong>.""."	The <em>cross</em> in the <em>mouth</em> of the <em>Monkey</em> ensured it<strong> speaketh</strong> no evil.	A MONKEY can't<strong> SPEAKETH</strong> of anything if he has a WALKING STICK driven through his TOUNGE WAGGING IN HIS MOUTH.

神		gods	Altar . . . monkey.		9	1200	1119	30	シン、ジン	かみ、かん-、こう-	"The<strong> Gods</strong> are gathered around debating Zeus' latest purchase for Mount Olympus. A huge and extremely kitsch gilded altar in the shape of giant ""speak no evil"" monkey. Hera decides she will never let him go shopping alone again ."	Hinduism has many<strong> gods</strong>, not just one God. One of the most famous of these<strong> gods</strong> is Hanuman the <em>monkey</em>.

With its fingers, a monkey<strong> search</strong>es its crotch for bugs to eat.	"If you are familiar with the Monkey legends ( 西遊記 Journey to the West) there is a good image for this character: While <strong>search</strong>ing for the end of the universe, <em>monkey</em> reaches to his <em>crotch</em> and urinates on Buddha's <em>fingers</em>. (Update: new link <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYXFppaKLL4"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYXFppaKLL4</a>)."	Heard about the fourth wise <em>monkey</em>? Often overlooked after Hear, See and Speak no Evil, he's <strong>Seek</strong> no Evil. Picture the four famous monkeys at Nikko, the fourth covering his <em>crotch</em> with his <em>fingers</em>, showing he won't be <strong>searching</strong> for any evil deeds in that evil place.	"Watch this VIDEO and you will definitely never forget this kanji.

果		fruit	The final stage of the seed is reached when the plant has reached its full growth (the <i>tree</i>) and comes to fruition, producing <b>fruit</b> full of new seeds that can return to the earth and start the process all over again. The main thing to notice here is the element for <i>brains</i> at the top, which might prove more helpful than <i>rice field</i> for creating an image. The writing, however, follows the order of a <i>sun</i> with a <i>tree</i> whose trunk runs through the <i>sun</i>.		8	1202	1121	30	カ	は.たす、はた.す、-は.たす、は.てる、-は.てる、は.て	If only Eve had used her brains and not taken the forbidden<strong> fruit</strong> from the tree.

Enough said."	Just a pictogram of a cluster of<strong> fruit</strong> on a tree.	<strong>Fruit</strong> is like a productive <em>rice field</em> that grows on top of a <em>tree</em>. 悪因悪果 (sewing & reaping evil). 悪果 (bad results). 無花果果 (fig). 因果 (cause & effect). 規模効果 (economies of scale).	Instead of <em>brains</em> use <em>rice field</em> and we see a bunch of <em>fruit</em> trees growing about the perimeter of a <em>rice field</em>.		
菓		confectionary	Flowers . . . fruits.		11	1203	1122	30	カ		This candy is made in the shape of a <em>flower</em>, each petal with the taste of a different <em>fruit</em>.	Candy is coloured like flowers and flavoured like fruit.	I think of Willy Wonka's factory where the flowers all bear <strong>candy</strong> fruits.	Willy Wonka, the<strong> confectionary</strong> wizard, is probably the only man with the <em>brains</em> to develop a <em>tree</em> whose <em>flowers</em> are all <strong>candy</strong>. 菓子 かし pastry; 菓子 みずがし fruit.	In Japan, <strong>candy</strong> can be flavored like <em>fruit</em> or <em>flowers</em> (e.g. rose-flavored gum).		
課		chapter	Words . . . fruit.		15	1204	1123	30	カ		After I finish each<strong> chapter</strong> of RTK, I eat a piece of <em>fruit</em> to celebrate all the new <em>words</em> I've learned. (Thanks Misha!).	"<em>Words</em> signify the written words in a book. The <em>fruit</em> represents something whole, complete. A<strong> chapter</strong> in a book often offers a complete idea, setting, or account. It's good to disambiguate the keyword from <a href=""../v4/82.html"">paragraph</a> (#82 項). To reinforce the kanji, imagine eating a fruit at the end of each<strong> chapter</strong> of Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" to reward yourself. (If you ate a fruit at the end of each paragraph, you'd very quickly run out of fruit)."	The <em>words</em> of each<strong> chapter</strong> bear a different <em>fruit</em>.	The first<strong> chapter</strong> of the Bible are <em>words</em> telling the story of <em>Adam and Eve</em> and how they ate the forbidden <em>fruit</em>.	"Here we think of the<strong> CHAPTER</strong> of the bible, namely<strong> CHAPTER</strong> three where you hear the lord SAY ""Who has eaten of the forbidden FRUIT?"" Goes well with the Naked frame that talks of the other forbidden FRUIT."		
裸		naked	Cloak . . . fruit.		13	1205	1124	30	ラ	はだか	Here we have Adam and Eve eating of the forbidden fruit and realizing they were<strong> naked</strong>, and so clothing themselves in a cloak.	Hey honey, I'm <strong>naked</strong> underneath this <em>cloak</em>. I've got some nice <em>melons</em> and a fresh <em>peach</em> waiting for you. Don't you want to taste my forbidden <em>fruits</em>…?	Eve was<strong> naked</strong> until she ate of the <em>fruit</em> and put a <em>cloak</em> on.	A cloak hides the fruit-bearing parts of one's<strong> naked</strong> body.	"The <em>cloak</em> slipped to her side to reveal her<strong> naked</strong> <em>fruit</em> (don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/498.html"">undress</a> (#498 脱))."		
斤		ax	This character represents a picture of an <b>ax</b>, the two vertical lines being the handle and the horizontal strokes of the blade. Note the writing order carefully.		4	1206	1125	31	キン	おの	Errata: stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. Top stroke is first.

析		chop	Tree . . . ax.		8	1207	1126	31	セキ		We<strong> chop</strong> down <em>trees</em> with <em>axes</em> to <strong>analyze</strong> their rings.	Wood + axe =<strong> chop</strong>? how much more simple can it get?	How much <em>wood</em> would a <em>wood</em>chopper<strong> chop</strong> if a <em>woodchopper</em> would<strong> chop</strong> <em>wood</em>? (Don't forget to imagine the <em>ax</em>).	"This more accurately means ""take apart"" or ""analyse"", so I guess, once you<strong> chop</strong> down the tree with an axe, you can analyse its structure."	To<strong> chop</strong> the TREE– use an AXE.		
所		place	Door . . . ax.		8	1208	1127	31	ショ	ところ、-ところ、どころ、とこ	You outsiders better learn your<strong> place</strong>! An <em>axe</em> stuck in the <em>door</em> when you get home is a pretty good indicator that this might not be the best<strong> place</strong> for you.	A <strong>place</strong> for everything and everything in its <strong>place</strong>. To the right of the <em>door</em> is the standard <strong>place</strong> for the <em>axe</em>.	When you come over to my<strong> place</strong>, you leave your <em>axe</em> at the <em>door</em>!	"Platz - The ""Shining"" (Jack Nicholson hacks the <em>door</em> with an <em>ax</em>) is not a nice<strong> place</strong> to be."	Heeeeeeere's Johnny! Jack Nicholson breaks down a <em>door</em> with his <em>ax</em> in order to get to his wife's hiding<strong> place</strong>.		
祈		pray	Altar . . . ax.		8	1209	1128	31	キ	いの.る	Religious freedom has not always been respected throughout history, and nobody knew how to force religion on an indigenous people like the Spanish missionaries. They posted conquistadors at either side of the <em>altars</em> at the local missions, and if anybody refused to<strong> pray</strong>, they would get the <em>axe</em>.	A warrior<strong> pray</strong>s for victory before the battle. He kneels at the <em>altar</em>, his battle <em>axe</em> at the ready.	When you come to the <em>altar</em> to<strong> pray</strong>, you need to leave your <em>axe</em> to one side. Biblical quote, settle your differences with someone before coming before your god.	At the altar ax da Lord and<strong> pray</strong> to help ya! Hallelujah!	D&D: the religious dwarf<strong> pray</strong> at the <em>altar</em>, with his trusty <em>axe</em> at his side.		
近		near	<i>Ax</i> . . . <i>road</i>. Be careful not to confuse with <i>draw near</i> (Frame 204) or <i>bystander</i> (Frame 1090).		7	1210	1129	31	キン、コン	ちか.い	The end is<strong> near</strong>. The <em>axe</em>-murderer is waiting for you on the <em>road</em>…	An absurd image, but working for me: two points A and B are separated by a long <em>road</em>. To make A and B<strong> near</strong>, take an <em>ax</em>, cut a big chunk of road, and the work is done.	Hint: Short- cut.	An <em>axe</em> left in the middle of the <em>road</em>!

"When I think of ""<strong> near</strong> "", I always think of that absurd muppet sketch with Grover running back and forth to demonstrate ""<strong> near</strong> "" and ""far"". So, I see grover on the <em>road</em> somewhere and I shout to him and ask him if he can show me ""<strong> near</strong> "". He runs up to me and shouts ""<strong> Near</strong> !""Then I kill him with my <em>axe</em> and sling him over my shoulder.

Contestants are given a sheet of paper and are told to<strong> fold</strong> it into a complex origami shape. If they're not done in 60 seconds, a huge axe descends from the ceiling and chops their work in half. Contestants know to recoil their hands from the falling axe, but some have been so absorbed in<strong> fold</strong>ing, they ignore the buzzer and get their fingers chopped off.	<strong>Fold</strong> some origami into the shape of an axe with your fingers. It's even as sharp, so watch out for paper cuts!	To hold an <em>axe</em>, you need to<strong> fold</strong> your <em>fingers</em> around the handle.	Japanese<strong> fold</strong> with their <em>fingers,</em> but the creases they make are as sharp as an <em>axe</em>.	I' m so strong, I can<strong> fold</strong> the axe with my fingers (works well for me, just imagine it clearly).		
哲		philosophy	Fold . . . mouth.		10	1212	1131	31	テツ	さとい、あき.らか、し.る、さば.く	A two-hour lesson of<strong> philosophy</strong> in high school. All the students, bored to death, are <em>folding</em> sheets of paper into planes, love notes or whatever, while the <em>mouth</em> of the teacher is talking about Platon, Kierkegaard and many other notorious philosophers.	I fold my mouth, therefore I am.	All the<strong> philosophy</strong> that comes out of my <em>mouth</em> I learned from those Chinese fortune cookies with the <em>folded</em> paper inside. 'Confucius say…', et cetera. Come to think of it, the cookie itself looks like a weirdly <em>folded mouth</em>.	This friend of mine once unknowingly popped the whole fortune cookie into his <em>mouth</em>. Then using his <em>fingers</em> he retrieved a <em>folded</em> piece of paper. And it was the only time some<strong> philosophy</strong> came out of his <em>mouth</em>.	Here's a philosophical question: Can you <em>fold</em> a <em>hole</em>?		
逝		departed	"The connotation is of a ""dearly <b>departed</b>"" who has passed away. The elements: <i>fold</i> . . . <i>road</i>."		10	1213	1132	31	セイ	ゆ.く、い.く	One of the dearest of Japan's dearly<strong> departed</strong> is Sasaki Sadako, who developed Leukemia after the bombing of Hiroshima, and became famous for <em>folding</em> more than a thousand paper cranes, never giving up hope. To this day, people in Hiroshima still <em>fold</em> origami cranes in her memory. For this character, let us imagine a parade in her honor, the entire <em>road</em> lined with <em>folded</em> cranes.	The BIG ONE hits Tokyo. You see a news report of the recently<strong> departed</strong> victims who died when the <em>roads</em> <em>folded</em> (from the earthquake).	The<strong> departed</strong> are those who have crossed that <em>fold</em> you cannot see past in the <em>road</em> we all walk.	In the film The<strong> Departed</strong> a guy falls out of the window and ends up <em>folded</em> double on the <em>road</em> below.	Picture the funeral procession of a great head of state (i.e. JFK) a dearly<strong> departed</strong> loved one to a nation. See his coffin drapped with the <em>folded</em> American flag as it is moved through the <em>roads</em> and streets of our nation's Capitol.		
誓		vow	Fold . . . words.		14	1214	1133	31	セイ	ちか.う	"This Japanese couple wrote the<strong> vow</strong>s that they had made to each other onto a piece of paper and then <em>folded it into an origami</em>, and put it somewhere in their appartment. To everybody else it is an <em>origami</em>, but to them it is also a symbol of their<strong> vow</strong>s. – ""the <em>folded words</em> are<strong> vow</strong>s"". Note : in this story and a few others I use the image of an <em>origami</em> for the primitive ""<em>fold</em>""."	A Japanese wedding tradition is to present each other with <em>origami cranes</em> with their <strong>vows</strong> <em>written</em> on the BOTTOM.	"Sadako Sasaki<strong> vow</strong>ed to <em>fold</em> 1000 paper cranes and kept her <em>word</em>. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Sasaki"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Sasaki</a>)."	"If you're a sci-fi/fantasy reader –> The Aes Sedai of Robert Jordan's ""The Wheel of Time"" series were famously forced to take three<strong> vow</strong>s, one of which was to never lie. This was next to pointless, however, as the old broads easily got around it by being so skilled at <em>folding</em> their <em>words</em> that while they never TECHNICALLY lied … the absolute truth that they spoke was still highly deceptive."	After cutting himself badly, <em>Socrates</em><strong> vow</strong>ed never to <em>fold</em> origami again.		
斬		chop off	Car . . . ax.		11	1215	2092	31	ザン、サン、セン、ゼン	き.る	I wanted a convertible so I <strong>chopped off</strong> the top of my <em>car</em> with an <em>axe</em>.	"A ""chop shop"" is a place where stolen <em>cars</em> are taken, and parts <strong>chopped off</strong> with an <em>axe</em>, to be sold."	Picture a death-mobile car with rotating axes on the hood that drives by and chops off people's heads. [beheading is another common meaning].	"Seen before in ""Steadily"" and ""Temporarily"". Both stories talked about taking an AXE to a CAR. Here, either take the horror movie approach where a driver in a CAR had his head CHOPPED OFF by a maniac with an AXE, or take the<strong> CHOP OFF</strong> shop approach where a guy is cutting up a CAR with an AXE."	In movies <em>cars</em> often have their tops <strong>chopped off</strong> as if with an <em>axe</em>.		
暫		temporarily	Chop off . . . days.		15	1216	1134	31	ザン	しばら.く	Your car has been savagely (see steadily) attacked by an ax. It will be some days before your car is fixed. So you are<strong> temporarily</strong> without car.	Today is Car Axe Day. The day where you can<strong> temporarily</strong> (today only) attack cars using an axe without punishment.	"The top kanji is <a href=""../v4/2092.html"">chop off</a> (#2092 斬)."	Axe murderer hiding in a car<strong> temporarily</strong> for a few days after killing someone.	"[<a href=""../v4/2092.html"">chop off</a> (#2092 斬) … day] During daylight saving time, we <strong>temporarily</strong> <em>chop off</em> the <em>day</em> by taking an hour out of it, which we will return back in six months."		
漸		steadily	Water . . . chop off.		14	1217	1135	31	ゼン	やや	I imagine firemen working<strong> steadily</strong> to rescue a man from a crashed <em>car</em>. First, they spray it with <em>water</em>; then, they use an <em>axe</em> to break through the window.	Water + Car + Axe: The<strong> steadily</strong> rising water was filling the car, but the firefighters took their axe and broke the window, getting me out.	<em>Dripping water</em> on your <em>car</em><strong> steadily</strong> builds up rust. Over time, it's just as damaging as taking an <em>ax</em> to it.	"Driving<strong> steadily</strong> down the road in the <em>wet</em> in a <a href=""../v4/2092.html"">chop off</a> (#2092 斬) convertible. Singing in the rain."	The attempt to fix the <em>car</em>'s radiator with an <em>axe</em> did not go well. There was a steady drip drip drip of <em>water</em>.		
断		severance	Fishhook . . . rice . . . ax.		11	1218	1136	31	ダン	た.つ、ことわ.る、さだ.める	[Based on fuaburisu's] A man puts some <em>rice</em> on a <em>fishhook</em> as bait, but catches a fish so strong, he needs to take out his <em>axe</em> and <strong>sever</strong> the line lest he be dragged into the depths.	When you get the ax at work, use your<strong> severance</strong> pay to buy fishhooks and rice. At least that way you can eat sushi.	The <em>axe man</em> is fishing at a nearby river, using a <em>rice-ball on a hook</em> as bait. He catches some real big fish, which is pulling so hard on the line that <em>axe man</em> has to <strong>sever</strong> the line or let go of his pricey fishing rod. And at the same time there is the idea of<strong> severance</strong> in <em>axe man</em> having to let go of his big catch.	Your manager brings you into his office and offers you three<strong> severance</strong> packages. You can take the <em>hook</em> (become a fisherman), take the <em>rice</em> (become a farmer), or take the <em>axe</em> (become a lumberjack). Picture the items laid out on his desk like the shopkeepers in Zelda.	After he got <em>hooked</em> on <em>rice</em> wine the Japanese salaryman got the <em>axe</em> at work. Now all he has to live on is serverance pay.

"[seems to mean ""substance"" in the sense of essential nature or core quality, most common usage might be 質問 , shitsumon (inquiry)] a pair of scientists are smashing away at a mysterious <strong>shell</strong> with <strong>axes</strong>, pounding it into powder so they can feed it into their analysis machine and discover exactly what<strong> substance</strong> it's made up of."	This guy dealing in illegal<strong> substance</strong>s makes a lot of <em>shells</em> (money), but he's always equipped with his <em>dual-axe</em> … it's a dangerous job.	The newest illegal<strong> substance</strong> on the streets is Shellinium. It's made of <em>shells</em> hacked to bits with <em>axes</em>.

It freaks out customers, so it doesn't make it to the shops.	My pawn shop<strong> reject</strong>s any axe with even a drop of blood.

昨		yesterday	Day . . . saw.		9	1222	1140	31	サク		One can use a simple word play to remember this character - the <em>day</em> that I <em>saw</em> before today was<strong> yesterday</strong>.	Yester-DAY, all my troubles seemed SAW far away…	Today I see.<strong> Yesterday</strong> I saw.	My coworker has an excessive way of updating his daily calendar. Instead of throwing<strong> yesterday</strong>'s page into the trash, he'll pulverize it with a chainsaw he keeps under his desk.	<strong>Yesterday</strong>: a <em>day</em> that has been <em>sawed</em> off from time and can never be lived again.		
詐		lie	The <b>lie</b> in this character refers to falsehoods and fibs. Its elements: <i>words</i> . . . <i>saw</i>.		12	1223	1141	31	サ	いつわ.る	Pinnochio gets frustrated that every time he utters a <em>word</em> of a<strong> lie</strong>, his nose grows and he has to get the <em>saw</em> out again.	Her<strong> lie</strong>s are words that cut not like a knife, no not cleanly, but savagely like a saw.	Hint: I think of<strong> lie</strong>s as <em>serrated words</em> for some reason.	This really has the connotation of fraud rather than<strong> lie</strong> but the Pinnochio story works too well.	His words were false; I saw right through his<strong> lie</strong>.

録		record	<i>Metal</i> . . . <i>broom</i> . . . <i>rice</i>. Note how the final stroke of the <i>broom</i> is extended slightly when an element below is attached directly to it.		16	1226	1144	31	ロク		A monk won a <em>gold metal</em> for breaking the current<strong> record</strong> for most <em>swept rice</em> in one minute.	This character is about a <strong>record</strong>ing for a music box. The tines of the mechanism are like a <em>metal</em> <em>broom</em> and the little pins on the cylinder are like <em>metal</em> <em>grains of rice</em>.	Historians have discovered an ancient<strong> record</strong> about Buddhist monastic life<strong> record</strong>ed in <em>gold</em> plates.

They tried to sweep away the evidence, but some of it stuck. (Note: katakana エロ <em>ero</em> in the middle of this kanji is the Japanese word for erotica.).	"As a verb this means, this means ""to ask; to enquire; to search; to look for; to look into; to investigate;"". Imagine the police inquiring in an in-depth investigation. They are interrogating a suspect. But the suspect has a <em>crafty mouth</em> and is very sly. He/she also knows when to keep their mouth shut(<em>glued</em>) at the right moments to avoid self-incrimination. As a final measure, the police torture the suspect by tickling him/her with a broom while they<strong> inquire</strong>."	"You are new in Japan and you<strong> inquire</strong> about a new job. Lucky for you, there is one. You're now the guy with the <em>broom</em> who sweeps the <em>エロ (ero)</em> ""studio"" after they're done.

The cleaning lady found some <em>エロ ero</em> pictures <em>glued</em> together while sweeping the floor and started to<strong> inquire</strong> everyone around about it.

急		hurry	Bound up . . . broom . . . heart.		9	1229	1146	31	キュウ	いそ.ぐ、いそ.ぎ	She was always <em>bound</em> to a <em>broom</em>, her <em>heart</em> pounding in a<strong> hurry</strong> to finish before she was punished for being slow.	In a<strong> hurry</strong> to tidy up before guests arrive, you're feverishly sweeping with a bunch of <strong>brooms</strong> <strong>bound</strong> together, your <strong>heart</strong> pounding.

穏		calm	Wheat . . . vulture . . . broom . . . heart.		16	1230	1147	31	オン	おだ.やか	This whole kanji is a picture of <strong>calm</strong>ness. The <em>wheat</em> has been harvested and even the <em>vultures</em> sit<strong> calm</strong>ly watching the humans <em>sweep</em> and clean-up after the harvest is over. <em>Hearts</em> are peaceful and<strong> calm</strong> at this time of the year. Even the days are<strong> calm</strong> without storm.	The farmer is<strong> calm</strong> knowing that his <em>wheat</em> fields are protected from <em>vultures</em> by his <em>strawman</em> with a <em>heart</em> (all the better to do the job properly).	A<strong> Calm</strong> day: the <em>vulture</em> is flying above the <em>wheat</em> fields, where there's a a scarecrow made with a <em>broom</em> with an <em>heart</em> painted on the shirt (like oz scarecrow).	The farmer lying in the middle of the wheat field is so<strong> calm</strong> the vultures think he is dead and keep trying to get at his heart.

I assign <em>broomhouse</em> meaning to whole primitive. – <em>Mr. T</em> locks in a <em>broomhouse</em> anyone who <strong>encroaches</strong> upon his position of leadership."	Here we see the sex starved Marine SENTRY about to<strong> ENCROACH</strong> upon the French MAID (broom, crown, and a nice crotch?). Makes for an easy mental picture.		
浸		immersed	Water . . . broom . . . crown . . . crotch.		10	1232	1149	31	シン	ひた.す、ひた.る	The French maid draws a bath for her amorous master, but slips and falls in - getting<strong> immersed</strong>. (thanks to Nukemarine for the French maid image!).	<strong><em><em>YOU MUST BE 18 YEARS AND OVER TO SEE THIS </em></em></strong> You load SEXY.FRENCH.MAIDS.XViD.avi and you see a French maid,<strong> immersed</strong> in sperm.

Often in a <em>broomhouse</em> you also have <em>water</em> so that your broom can be<strong> immersed</strong> before the cleaning.		
寝		lie down	Do not confuse this key word with either the element for <i>reclining</i> or the character for <i>prostrated</i> (Frame 1035). Its primitive elements are: <i>house</i> . . . <i>turtle</i> . . . <i>broom</i> . . . <i>crown</i> . . . <i>crotch</i>.		13	1233	1150	31	シン	ね.る、ね.かす、い.ぬ、みたまや、や.める	After work, the <em>French maid</em> goes <em>home</em> and lies down with a <em>turtle</em>.

The <em>French maid</em> I hired cleans my <em>house</em> as slowly as a <em>turtle</em>, but I keep her on, because I love to 'lie down' with her…	While the <em>maid</em> in our <em>house</em> was <strong>lying down</strong>, I touched her <em>crotch</em>, but there was half a <em>turtle shell</em> covering it. Nice foresight girl!	For this kanji,<strong> LIE DOWN</strong> in your HOUSE and imagine a MAID (broom, crown and crotch should make an easy picture). In her HOUSE, she gets lax and<strong> LIE DOWN</strong>, with her feet propped on a TURTLE table. Maid works great in the previous two kanji's, did it not?		
婦		lady	Woman . . . broom . . . apron.		11	1234	1151	31	フ	よめ	In high society, a<strong> lady</strong> is a <em>woman</em> who never touches a <em>broom</em> or an <em>apron</em>.	The<strong> LADY</strong> of the house is nothing more than a WOMAN who's a HOUSEWIFE (BROOM and APRON anyone?).	Im a laaaaidy! (little britain) - heres the old fashioned woman with her apron on beating a man up with a broom because he made an ungentleman like advancement on her.	The French maid is the ideal<strong> lady</strong> – here's a <em>woman</em> that comes to your house dressed in an <em>apron</em> and carrying a <em>broom</em>. To enforce the position of the primitives, make this a particularly kinky maid that is wearing just the <em>apron</em> below her waist, and using the <em>broom</em> to cover her breasts.	The <em>French maid</em> modestly covers her crotch with a <em>towel</em> when she enters the <em>women</em>s' bath. As dirty as she may be in her private life, in public she is a perfect<strong> lady</strong>.		
掃		sweep	Fingers . . . broom . . . apron.		11	1235	1152	31	ソウ、シュ	は.く	Whether I<strong> SWEEP</strong> something away with my FINGERS or my BROOM, I should always wear my APRON.

当		hit	Little . . . broom.		6	1236	1153	31	トウ	あ.たる、あ.たり、あ.てる、あ.て、まさ.に、まさ.にべし	Some mothers use a <em>small broom</em> to<strong> hit</strong> their children when they misbehave.	[hit; right; appropriate; himself] If you're old enough, this is a pictograph of an Atari joystick (which, BTW, got its name from this word/kanji). You can also think of how an Atari joystick is like a <em>small</em> <em>broom</em> with which you can <strong>hit</strong> and sweep off the enemies from the screen…	"Here is a weird carnival game where you hold a <em>broom</em> like a javelin and throw it, trying to<strong> hit</strong> the center of a very <em>small</em> target. The target is so <em>small</em>, in fact, that if someone does manage to<strong> hit</strong> it, the operator turns in surprise and says, ""Whoa, really?!

彙		glossary	The top primitive of this character is actually an old form of <i>broom</i>. The remaining elements are: <i>crown</i> . . . <i>fruit</i>.		13	1237	2997	31	イ	はりねずみ	"I was having <em>mutual difficulties</em> in my relationship. She was always the one wearing the <em>crown</em> and I was the one picking the <em>fruit</em>. In order to fix the problem I checked the<strong> glossary</strong> for ""<em>mutual difficulties</em>"" but found nothing. I guess we're going to have to <em>mutually end</em> our relationship."	"When I went to <em>Headless Mutual</em>, the bank for tough London gangsters, I was given a pamphlet that said ""If you try'a rip us off, we'll give you the rough end of a pineapple."" I didn't quite understand this phrase, but it was important that I knew my legal obligations, so I consulted my <strong>Glossary</strong> of British Thieves' Argot. The result: ""'give one the rough end of a pineapple': lit. insert the <em>crown</em> of the <em>fruit</em> into the recipient's anus. Metaphorically used to mean 'to exact vengeance'. Oh, I see now."	"People who read the<strong> glossary</strong> are <em>mutually exclusive</em> (exclude the top line of <a href=""../v4/757.html"">mutually</a> (#757 互) ) from those who eat <em>crowned fruit</em> イ はりねずみ same kind 語彙 ."	"I was reading a recipe book but had trouble figuring out what a ""pineapple"" was. Thanks to the <em>one-way assisting</em><strong> glossary</strong> at the end, I learnt that a pineapple was a <em>crowned fruit</em>."	We had no idea what a <em>crowned fruit</em> was so we <em>mutually</em> checked the<strong> glossary</strong>. Well, I say mutually, but really I did all the work.		
争		contend	Bound up . . . rake.		6	1238	1154	31	ソウ	あらそ.う、いか.でか	This can be seen as a Retarius, a roman gladiator. The Retiarius always fought with a net to <em>bound up</em> his opponents, and with a <em>trident</em>, which was able to pierce enemies after tying them. They were terrific <strong>contenders</strong>, so they were only paired with gladiators specially equipped to fight them.	A boxing ring is <em>bound up</em> by the ropes. The<strong> contend</strong>er is cheating and using a <em>rake</em>.	In an episode of the Simpsons, Sideshow Bob is trying to kill Bart, but on the way has to<strong> contend</strong> with a pile of <em>rakes</em> which keep him <em>bound up</em> for some time.	The peasants revolt: if you do weird things to them in your castle, you may have to<strong> contend</strong> with a mob ready to <em>bind you up</em> and beat you to death with <em>rakes</em>.	One of the<strong> contend</strong>ers in Street Fighter 2 is<em>Vega</em> who has <em>rakes bound</em> to his hands.		
浄		clean	Water . . . contend.		9	1239	1155	31	ジョウ、セイ	きよ.める、きよ.い	Bottled water marketers contend to make their version of tap water sound the<strong> clean</strong>est.	The <em>water</em> <em>contends</em> against the dirt in the ultimate battle for <strong>cleaninless</strong>.	Separate the primitives. <strong>Cleaning</strong> the garden involves <em>watering</em> the lawn and <em>binding</em> up all the leaves with a <em>rake</em>.	I wanna see a<strong> clean</strong> fight. Pour <em>water</em> on the <em>contenders</em> to make them<strong> clean</strong>. (silly I know).	"<em>Gladiators</em> (see my story for <a href=""../v4/1154.html"">contend</a> (#1154 争)) often bathed in <em>water</em> or <em>oil</em> before a battle, so that their opponents would have a hard time trying to grab them. As a result, they looked very <strong>clean</strong> and shiny!"		
事		matter	This key word here refers to abstract <b>matters</b>. The elements are: <i>one</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>rake</i>. Note how the <i>rake</i> handle reaches out the top and bottom of the character.		8	1240	1156	31	ジ、ズ	こと、つか.う、つか.える	Just <em>one</em> word about this<strong> matter</strong> from your <em>mouth</em> and you will find this <em>rake</em> across it.	I had to take <em>one</em> day off from work due to 'personal<strong> matter</strong>s' after stepping on a <em>rake</em> and having the handle snap up and smack me across the <em>mouth</em>. I certainly wasn't going to tell anyone about it.	This is a pictograph of someone stepping on a rake, and the handle coming up to hit them in the face…no laughing<strong> matter</strong>.	This IS a laughing<strong> matter</strong>: <em>One mouth</em> getting smacked after someone steps on a <em>rake</em> - classic slapstick comedy!	Just one word from your mouth about this<strong> matter</strong> and I'll stab you with a fucking trident.		
唐		T'ang	The key word here refers of course to the <b>T'ang</b> Dynasty in China (and not to the name of the drink astronauts take with them into outer space, though this could be useful for the next frame). Its elements: <i>cave</i> . . . <i>rake</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>.		10	1241	1157	31	トウ	から	"Two archeologists are in a <em>cave</em> looking at Chinese artifacts from various eras. One picks up a <em>rake</em> and says, ""What about this – T'ang, do you think?"" The second puts the <em>rake</em> in his <em>mouth</em> and answers, ""Yes, it does <strong>tang</strong> a bit""."	Screw it, this character refers to the drink. The powdery orange substance is actually found on the floor of tropical <em>caves</em>, where trained aboriginal peoples use wooden <em>rakes</em> to rake the Tang into a pile before putting a bit of it in their <em>mouths</em> to see if it's tasty or not.	(Based on matticus) The <strong>Tang</strong> juice was created in China in the <strong>T'ANG</strong> dinasty. The T'ANG emperor discovered that certain <strong>cave</strong>s walls had a very sweet smell, so he <strong>raked</strong> the walls of one of them and put the <strong>rake</strong> into his <strong>mouth</strong>. This way he discovered that tasty powder that nowadays is known as TANG juice.	Archaeologists found an ancient RAKE from the T'ang dynasty at the MOUTH of the CAVE.	I imagine that people from the T'ang dinasty looked a bit like cartoony asians, with teeth so prominent that looked like <em>rakes</em> on their <em>mouth</em>. They felt ridiculous about that, so they usually hid on <em>caves</em>, wishing for a dinasty with better depictions.		
糖		sugar	Rice . . . T'ang.		16	1242	1158	31	トウ		<strong>Sugar</strong> made from rice has a tangy flavour.	The <em>T'ang</em> are the ones who began using<strong> sugar</strong> in China–of course, the first thing they tried it on was <em>rice</em>.	The ultimate<strong> sugar</strong>y breakfast is a <em>rice krispy treat</em> and a big glass of <em>Tang</em>.	This is what my research yielded on the origin of the kanji: The traditional form of<strong> sugar</strong> in China was maltose, which is a form a<strong> sugar</strong> made from malt (= dried <em>grains</em>). It was still used in the late Han and throughout the Tang period, though during the Tang<strong> sugar</strong> cane substituted <em>grains</em> as the primary source of<strong> sugar</strong>.	<em>Condi Rice</em> wakes up every morning and spoons about three cups of<strong> sugar</strong> into her <em>Tang</em>. Why? Well, she's got to have something to hype her up about facing the American public day after day. Picture her waking up and shaking until she gets her daily<strong> sugar</strong> ration…then things go overboard and she starts to pipe<strong> sugar</strong>-loaded <em>Tang</em> straight into her veins..		
康		sane	Cave . . . sieve.		11	1243	1159	31	コウ		A psychiatric hospital is located in a CAVE. To determine, which patients are<strong> sane</strong> and can be released, they are given a SIEVE and asked to empty a bathtub (the<strong> sane</strong> ones take out the plug and get the water out with <strong>ease</strong>).	People on the <em>cave</em> age became more<strong> sane</strong> after they started using <em>sieves</em> to avoid eating harmful things with their grains. (This kanji is almost exclusively used to write 健康 , health).	Ever since I meditated in the <em>cave</em> and realised that wearing a <em>sieve</em> on my head would stop the C.I.A controlling my thoughts, I've been completely<strong> SANE</strong>.	Japanese doctors recommend you retreat to a <em>cave</em> every week to <em>sieve</em> rice through a <em>rake</em>. It will keep you <strong>sane</strong>, sound, healthy, and wholesome.	A<strong> sane</strong> person in a polluted CAVE will use a SIEVE to breath.		
逮		apprehend	Think of <b>apprehending</b> criminals. The elements are: <i>sieve</i> . . . <i>road</i>.		11	1244	1160	31	タイ		Think police roadblocks. They act like road sieves, letting good people through but<strong> apprehend</strong>ing criminals.	"In Space Balls, they were combing the desert in order to<strong> apprehend</strong> Lone Star. Picture Dark Helmet saying ""Combing the desert failed, we must now sieve the road!""."	The police have a new way of<strong> apprehend</strong>ing criminals; a big <em>sieve</em> in the <em>road</em>. Innocent people pass over, but people with a guilty conscience fall through.	"Corrupt cops <strong>""apprehend""</strong> a suspect by shooting him in the middle of the <em>road</em>, shooting him until he's so full of holes he's leaking like a <em>sieve</em>. No wonder the general population is so <strong>apprehensive</strong> when the police roam the streets: they don't want to be shot up like a <em>sieve</em> on the <em>road</em>. —— Avoid confusing <a href=""../v4/654.html"">arrest</a> (#654 拘) and <a href=""../v4/1160.html"">apprehend</a> (#1160 逮)."

伊		Italy	"Used chiefly in proper names, and given the sound ""i,"" this kanji can be remembered as an abbreviation of <b>Italy</b>, for which it is still used today in Japan. Its primitives: <i>person</i> . . . <i>mop</i>."		6	1245	1161	31	イ	かれ	"The ""boot"" of<strong> Italy</strong> has gotten Europe all muddy. Who else could mop it up but <em>Mr T</em>?"	Here I have <em>Mister T</em> cleaning up with a <em>mop</em>, a real mess of spaghetti, in front of the Piza (in<strong> Italy</strong>).	The radical on the right looks to me like a <em>fork</em> holding a <em>spaghetti</em>. In <strong>Italia</strong> is pretty common to see <em>people</em> eating spaghetti.	Mr. T is so excited to be<strong> Italy</strong>! Wow!! He gets off the plane and sees what must be an Italian delicacy! Spaghetti on a stick! look at those huuuuuge noodles! T is chowing down. Meanwhile, the airport janitor is wondering why <em>Mr. T</em> is eating his <em>mop</em>…	<em>Luke Skywalker</em> in<strong> Italy</strong>, <em>mop</em>-in-hand working as a cleaner for a pizza restaurant. Sometimes, when nobody is around, he pretends the <em>mop</em> is a lightsaber, reliving his glory days.		
君		old boy	The somewhat highbrow British term of address is chosen hereto represent the kanji for a form of address used towards one's juniors. It is composed of: <i>mop</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>.		7	1246	1162	31	クン	きみ、-ぎみ	"There's a tendency in Japan to make the younger members (kouhai) clean up after the older members (senpai) of a group, which results in a lot of grumbling and whining. ""Well<strong> old boy</strong>,"" a senpai might say, ""If you did as much work with the <em>mop</em> as you do with your <em>mouth,</em> you would have been done an hour ago""."	The Beatles, english<strong> old boy</strong>s, had hairs like <em>mop</em> and a good singing <em>mouth</em>.	君 [kimi] is said by the<strong> old boy</strong> to the younger boy, never the other way around as it would be an insult.	"For this character I think of the Korean movie ""<strong>oldboy</strong>"", in which the protagonist has hair like a <em>mop</em> and a <em>mouth</em> that screams in agony.

耐		-proof	"The key word is a suffix used to indicate ""safe from"" or ""protected against,"" as in the words rust<b>proof</b>, water<b>proof</b>, and fire<b>proof</b>.

But unfortunately it is not idiot-proof–and I glued it to myself.	I spent $100 recently on this excellent rust-proof, water-proof, fire-proof comb. But two days after having bought it, I left it in my back pocket and sat down, snapping this expensive comb in half! I glued it back together, but now every time I try to comb through my thick hair, it just breaks apart again. I guess my comb is also glue-proof.	<em>Glue</em> your hair together and it will be <em>comb</em><strong>-proof</strong>.	"Urushi is one of the hardest lacquers(and glues) known to man.

The primitives: <i>rain</i> . . . <i>comb</i>."		14	1249	1165	31	ジュ		Supply and<strong> demand</strong> is a simple concept: when it <em>rains</em>, the<strong> demand</strong> for <em>combs</em> goes up to deal with wet hair.	If it's raining combs, then the<strong> demand</strong> for them sure does drop.	If it <em>rains</em>, the<strong> demand</strong> for <em>combs</em> will rise. However, if it <em>rains combs</em>, the<strong> demand</strong> for <em>combs</em> will fall. It's all about supply and<strong> demand</strong>. (A combination of radical tyro's and FuduMyo's stories).	It's <em>raining</em> <em>combs</em>?? I<strong> demand</strong> an explanation for this shit.	A smart salesman will know which kind of <em>weather</em> will cause frizzy hair, with the subsequent increase in the<strong> demand</strong> for <em>combs</em>.

It probably wouldn't seem so heroic if you saw him ten minutes earlier, when a crew of stylists was carefully <em>combing</em> his hair so it would fall perfectly.	"When you <em>stand</em> a <em>comb</em> on its<strong> edge</strong>, it looks like the <a href=""../v4/768.html"">mountain</a> (#768 山) kanji."

But no, I feel quite <strong>full</strong> now.	"I hate going on dates where a girl says ""I'll have a <em>salad</em> and a <em>water</em>"" and then insists that they <em>both</em> make her<strong> full</strong>!"	Just imagine you and your closest Japanese class rival having a contest to see who can get<strong> full</strong> marks ( 満点 ）in a test, the winner is given <em>Flowers</em>, the looser is drenched with ice cold <em>water</em>, now imagine you <em>both</em> get<strong> full</strong> marks and so <em>both</em> of you get drenched and flowered.	In spring, the <em>water</em> of Kyoto's waterways is<strong> full</strong> of cherry blossom <em>flowers</em>, right up to the banks on <em>both</em> sides.		
画		brush-stroke	In forming an image for the key word, it is helpful to know that this kanji is used for artistic representations (like a completed painting), and as a counter for the number of <b>brush-strokes</b> in a character (as, for instance, in Indexes II and III at the end of this book). Its elements are: <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>sprout</i> . . . <i>shovel</i>.		8	1254	1170	31	ガ、カク、エ、カイ	えが.く、かく.する、かぎ.る、はかりごと、はか.る	You decide one day to paint a kanji on your ceiling. Unfortunately, you don’t have a brush, so, being innovative, you use a sprout. Knowing it could be messy, you search for a drop-cloth, but can’t find one. Instead, you put a shovel down on the floor to catch any drips resulting from the BRUSH-STROKEs.	To paint a kanji in your <em>ceiling</em> with only natural materials, you use a <em>sprout</em> as a <strong>brush</strong> and <em>shovel</em> some dirt to use as paint for your <strong>strokes</strong>. [modified from johnskb's].	Start with just <em>one</em> stroke. Soon more will <em>sprout</em>, and then you end up with a whole <em>shovel</em>full!	The first kanji I learnt was just <em>one</em><strong> brush stroke</strong>, but then my knowledge <em>sprouted</em> and I knew a <em>shovel</em>ful.	"New age artist. The canvas is on the <em>ceiling</em>. The floor is covered with bean <em>sprouts</em>. The artist takes a <em>shovel</em> and makes a sweeping motion on the ground, sending a stream of sprouts flying up to the ceiling and sticking to the canvas in strange patterns. ""This is radical calligraphy,"" he says, panting for breath, ""and the act of shoveling is my new-age equivalent of the classical<strong> brush stroke</strong>.""."

曲		bend	Picture yourself grabbing hold of the two strokes poking out the top of the kanji and wrenching them apart, thus giving the sense of <b>bend</b>. If you think of them as deriving from the element for <i>brains</i> beneath (of course, the middle stroke has been reduplicated and pulled out to where it can be grabbed hold of), you can associate the key word with <b>bending</b> someone's mind to your own point of view.		6	1256	1172	31	キョク	ま.がる、ま.げる	"It looks like the mouth of <em>Bender the robot</em>, from Matt Groening's animated series ""Futurama"". Thus, I use the character <em>Bender the robot</em> as a primitive."	"Also means ""melody"". Think of it as a pictogram of a guitar where you have to <strong>bend</strong> the strings to make a <strong>melody</strong>."	When <em>two sprouts sprout</em> at the same place they don't have enough space and have to<strong> bend</strong> in different directions to grow…	"Hannibal Lecter exposes his victim's <em>brains</em> and inserts two <em>walking sticks</em>, using them to<strong> bend</strong> the victim to his will.

You have to<strong> bend</strong> the strings to produce a <em>melody</em>.		
曹		cadet	This character is written in the order of its elements: <i>one</i> . . . <i>bend</i> . . . <i>sun</i>.		11	1257	1173	31	ソウ、ゾウ	つかさ、ともがら、へや	A space<strong> cadet</strong> eager to make one bend around the sun. (a dangerous maneuver).	<em>Bender</em> lasted just <em>one day</em> in the space<strong> cadet</strong>s.	Japanese<strong> cadet</strong>s have to constantly do <em>one</em> thing–<em>bend</em> OVER all <em>day</em>, bowing to their superiors.	"Hint : As a primitive I use the image of Bender the robot from the animated series ""Futurama"" (by the same creator as ""The Simpsons""). Here Bender is a<strong> cadet</strong> at the army, and the sergeant who is blinded by the sun reflected on Bender's metallic body, keeps saying ""this<strong> cadet</strong> is <em>one</em> -insert random expletive- <em>bend</em>er of the <em>sun</em>!"" (meaning Bender bends the sun's rays)."	"This is from back in <em>Bender</em>'s early days, when he was a promising young space<strong> cadet</strong> at the evil empire academy. He had one task - blow up <em>one</em> <em>sun</em>. <em>One</em>. <em>Sun</em>. That they had set up for him beforehand. Well, he ended up blowing up the entire solar system his outfit was stationed in. When he got called in for a meeting, the commander said: ""Cadet <em>Bender</em>, you were asked to blow up <em>one</em> <em>sun</em>. At this rate, you'll never be more than a<strong> cadet</strong>"". <em>Bender</em>: ""Screw this, I'm outta here""."

"<em>Bender the cadet</em> (see frame 1172) has an ""encounter of the third kind"" on the <em>road</em>. Reference to Steven Spielberg's 1977 movie ""Close<strong> Encounter</strong>s of the Third Kind"". Also a reference to popular stories of people reportedly chased by UFO's while driving on the road."	"Close<strong> encounter</strong>s of the third kind. You<strong> encounter</strong> a space <em>cadet</em> on the <em>road</em>. (tweaked version of radical tyro's story. Having ""alien"" in the story made me want to use 玄 in place of 曹 )."	"You<strong> encounter</strong> cadets on the road as they march ""hut 2-3-4"" (frame 1173)."	While traveling the Milky <em>road-way</em>, <em>Bender the space cadet</em> had an alien <em>encounter</em>. However, he's used to them by now, so it wasn't really a big deal.

The space <em>cadet</em> is in training,<strong> rowing</strong> in the <em>water</em> (see it splash).	A space <em>cadet</em> has crashed on an unknown planet. Fortunately he crashed in <em>water</em> so he's unharmed, but now he has to do some<strong> rowing</strong> to get out of the <em>water</em>.	"When the <em>cadets</em> are ordered into the <em>water</em>, it can only mean one thing -<strong> rowing</strong>.

"A true (?) story about Captain Cook and sauerkraut. Cook was convinced that sauerkraut would prevent the disease scurvy among his sailors, but his problem was getting his sailors to eat the stuff. He tricked the low-ranking <em>cadets</em> into eating sauerkraut by storing it in <em>wood</em><strong> vat</strong>s labeled ""for officers' use only"". The <em>cadets</em> thus believed that they were being unfairly denied access to the officers-only<strong> vat</strong>s, so they secretly stole and ate the sauerkraut - which was exactly what Cook wanted them to do."	Space <em>cadets</em> are decompressed in <em>wooden</em><strong> vat</strong>s when they return to Earth.	Cadets have to bathe in wooden<strong> vat</strong>s.		
斗		Big Dipper	The <b>Big Dipper</b> here is of course the constellation of Ursa Major, of which this kanji is a sort of pictographic representation.	"* Since we already have a primitive element for a ""dipper"" - namely, the <i>ladle</i> - we shall let this one stand for a <i>measuring cup</i>. By the way, it would make a rather large one, since the kanji is also used for a measure of about 18 liters!"	4	1261	1177	31	ト、トウ		"Since the meaning of ""big dipper"" is rather specific and the sense of measurement seems to be a more common usage, I concentrate on the primative meaning of <strong>measuring cup</strong>. This is a pictograph, with the first two strokes representing the measuring ticks on the side of the cup."	Is it just me, or do all of these traditional kanji pictographs look like they were drawn by a retarded bunny rabbit?	I looked out my window frame and saw two shooting stars slashing through the<strong> big dipper</strong>. Primitive: Big Gulp cup from 7-11.	This does not look like the<strong> big dipper</strong> or 18 liters of anything in any way, shape, or form.	The<strong> Big Dipper</strong> is a celestial measuring cup.		
料		fee	Measuring cup . . . rice.		10	1262	1178	31	リョウ		When buying <em>rice</em>, the<strong> fee</strong> is calculated by the cup. Naturally we don't just use any cup; it has to be a proper <em>measuring cup</em>.	Samurai(s) once received their<strong> fee</strong> in the form of <em>rice</em> that had been carefully weighed in a <em>measuring cup</em> beforehand.	Ancient Japan mobile promises no monthly<strong> fee</strong>s for long distance but I hate the fact that they don't take credit cards. I'm tired of mailing them a <em>measuring cup</em> full of <em>rice</em> every month.	Hidden <strong>fees</strong> are everywhere nowadays. Just the other day, I bought some rice, and they charged me for using the <em>measuring cup</em>!	This kanji is used in 料理 (cooking). Imagine a <strong>cooking</strong> recipe: Telling you how many <em>cups of rice</em> (measuring cups, of course) you need, and what the <strong>fee</strong> at the supermarket is.		
科		department	Think here of the faculty or <b>department</b> you entered in university, using the elements: <i>measuring cup</i> . . . <i>wheat</i>.		9	1263	1179	31	カ		University<strong> department</strong>s study things like <em>wheat</em> (agriculture) and the <em>big dipper</em> (physics/astronomy), and exact <em>measuring cups</em> (engineering).

The science<strong> department</strong>s at universities are trying to grow one wheat plant that can fill a whole measuring cup. (genetic engineering).	"An alphabetical list of the university's<strong> department</strong>s reads ""Agriculture (<em>wheat</em>), Astronomy (<em>Big Dipper</em>)…."" and so on."	The<strong> Department</strong> of <em>Wheat</em> Measurement has heard some strange things about <em>Cap 'n Crunch Cereal</em> recently - namely, that the amount of <em>wheat</em> in <em>Cap 'n Crunch Cereal</em> may not be as high as is claimed on the box. So here they are at the factory with a huge <em>garbage pail-sized measuring cup</em>, putting the appropriate amount of <em>wheat</em> into each box.

"I'll confuse this with <a href=""../v4/990.html"">use</a> (#990 使), so build a distinction right from the start. For me, ""utilize"" has an artificial, business-speak connotation; you only<strong> utilize</strong> ""utilize"" when you're trying to puff up what you're saying and sound important. So: ""BioTools Inc introduces the FG2000 screwdriver, <strong>utilizing</strong> the our latest <em>Flesh</em>Grip(tm) technology!"" I'm seeing this as a picture of a stubby screwdriver with a handle made of <em>flesh</em>, a short <em>shaft</em>, and prongs to hold a screw in place until you drive it."	When your flesh is weak you must<strong> utilize</strong> a walking stick.	We have to<strong> utilize</strong> different tools for different jobs.

But now I've settled in, got myself a few handy things like a <em>rake</em> and a <em>screwdriver</em>, and made myself more<strong> comfortable</strong>."	To make your cave more<strong> comfortable</strong>, you'll need to do some work with a rake and screwdriver. Clean it up. Fix a few things.	"Commonplace seems like a better keyword for this, though it's easier to confuse with others like ""usual"" and ""mediocre"". In this case, commonplace refers to something ordinary and non-exceptional. I picture a commonplace caveman's cave, with very ordinary, non-fancy, cave drawings he did with a screwdriver because he couldn't afford a writing brush. You have to visualize him etching the drawings with the screwdriver."	(Thanks rtkrtk) To live a<strong> comfortable</strong> life, the Flintstones need only a cave for living, a rake for cleaning and a screwdriver for fixing.

[I didn't write this… the original author deleted it… but it's my favourite story on the whole site.].	"This is the kanji for ""mukashi"". Often used for ""once upon a time"" or ""long time ago"". I will take this kanji to mean ""really fucking long time ago""……A really fucking long time ago, I use to eat <em>salad</em> every <em>day</em> and was very slim…..those days are long gone and I'm now fat as a pig…"	<strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a ruler called <em>ceaser</em> (shiza sarada).

惜		pity	"<i>State of mind</i> . . . <i>once upon a time</i>. The sense of the key word is that of a lost opportunity or bad turn of affairs, as in the phrase ""What a <b>pity</b>!"""		11	1271	1187	32	セキ	お.しい、お.しむ	What a<strong> pity</strong>! My <em>state of mind</em> when i think of the opportunities I missed from <em>once upon a time</em>.	"""I<strong> pity</strong> da foo who <strong>borrowed</strong> my place in this kanji! (Watch out <em>Data</em>!)."	"<em>Data</em> says ""What a <strong>pity</strong>"" when he hears that <em>once upon a time</em> there were no robots."	A state of mind when you regret things done once upon a time.	"""Pity?

"""<em>Once upon a time</em>…"" Oh hell, you're just too old for this. You close your fairy tale book and set it aside, pushing it away with your <em>fingers</em>."	To<strong> set aside</strong> in the sense of giving it up. We<strong> set aside</strong> childish things, namely, those ONCE UPON A TIME stories we grew up with– though those stories' faeries and Disney tinkerbells come up to us, we brush them away with our FINGERS, once after another, but they keep coming, not wanting to be<strong> set aside</strong>– so we flick them away!	Once upon a time, I<strong> set aside</strong> my fingers and began using chopsticks. The rest is history…..no more sticky fingers.	<em>Long ago</em> our ancestors<strong> set aside</strong> the use of fingers and began to use cutlery.		
散		scatter	Salad . . . flesh . . taskmaster.		12	1273	1189	32	サン	ち.る、ち.らす、-ち.らす、ち.らかす、ち.らかる、ばら	The <strong>taskmaster</strong> is dissatisfied with the meal she's served, and<strong> scatter</strong>s the <strong>salad</strong> & <strong>meat</strong> across the floor for the servants to clean up.	When his <em>salad</em> had <em>meat</em> in it, the vegetarian <em>taskmaster</em> blew his top and <strong>scattered</strong> it all over the restaurant floor.	"Perhaps you've heard of Nyotaimori or Nantaimori (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyotaimori"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyotaimori</a>) in which sushi is ate from the flesh of a naked person, the story comes easily.<strong> Scatter</strong> <em>salad</em> over the <em>flesh</em> of the <em>taskmaster</em> in preperation for some nantaimori :)."	"As we all know, <em>Hitler</em> was a vegetarian. So when he was enjoying his <em>salad</em> and found a bit of <em>flesh</em> <strong>scatter</strong>ed in it, he flipped out and <strong>scatter</strong>ed it all over the floor. After hearing it was the chef's special creation, a ""<em>Flesh</em><strong> Scatter</strong> <em>Salad</em>"", he goes on a rampage and startskilling people. Imagine him walking into a room, with people screaming, ""Oh no! It's <em>Hitler</em>!<strong> Scatter</strong>!<strong> Scatter</strong>!!""."	So… what's in the salad? Just some lettuce, the taskmaster answers, oh, and some human flesh. Everybody<strong> scatter</strong>s from the dinner table.		
廿		twenty	The two <i>tens</i> joined at the bottom by a short line is actually the old character for <b>twenty</b>, which we might as well learn since we need its primitive form. It is written the same as <i>salad</i>, except for the shorter final stroke.		4	1274	1190	32	ジュウ、ニュウ	にじゅう	A <em>generation</em> is 30, one stroke less is<strong> twenty</strong>.	"<em>Ten</em> plus <em>ten</em> is<strong> twenty</strong> (see <a href=""../v4/28.html"">generation</a> (#28 世))."	"十 <a href=""../v4/10.html"">ten</a> (#10 十)、廿 <a href=""../v4/1190.html"">twenty</a> (#1190 廿)、世 <a href=""../v4/28.html"">generation</a> (#28 世)."

I'll give you this<strong> twenty</strong> if you'll give me two tens. I just really got to break this<strong> twenty</strong>.		
庶		commoner	Caverns . . . oven fire.		11	1275	1191	32	ショ		<strong>Commoner</strong>s have to huddle in <em>caverns around a campfire</em>, while higher class people get heating and central air conditioning in a hotel.	If you are so poor that you are a<strong> commoner</strong>, you will have to live twenty<strong> commoner</strong>s to a cavern, with only one fire for everyone to share.	"PRIMITIVE: <em>Cave</em> + <em>twenty</em> = <strong>Finnish sauna</strong> (instead of Heisig's ""caverns"", which I'd confuse with ""cave""). This primitive meaning works well for all kanji it occurs in; I've posted stories for all of them. STORY: Wealthy people have a <em>sauna</em> in their house, but<strong> commoner</strong>s have to use their <em>oven fire</em> to warm themselves."	I draw upon The Two Towers again. Imagine the scene where the people of rohan seeks refuge in the cavernous fortress of Helms Cleft. The nobility and warriors stand ground at the bulwark, where as the<strong> commoner</strong> stay behind in the huge caverns of 20 little fireplaces.	Tamaki is fantasizing about Haruhi again (Ouran Host Club), thinking of her<strong> commoner</strong> lifestyle, eating<strong> commoner</strong> food–in this particular fantasy, she's in a <em>cave</em> with <em>twenty</em> raggedy<strong> commoner</strong> family members (must have borrowed some siblings from Yamada Taro Monogatari) trying to huddle around a <em>fire</em>, cooking some sort of<strong> commoner</strong> food.		
遮		intercept	Commoner . . . road.		14	1276	1192	32	シャ	さえぎ.る	The <em>commoners</em> are revolting! We must <strong>intercept</strong> them on the <em>road</em> before they reach the castle!	If don't want your secret message to be<strong> intercept</strong>ed, make sure your deliveryman is dressed as a <em>commoner</em> while traveling on the <em>road</em>.	Robin Hood was a <strong>commoner</strong>, but he still would routinely <em>intercept</em> the Sherriff of Nottingham on the road.	"This keyword is dangerously similar to <a href=""../v4/1160.html"">apprehend</a> (#1160 逮). The idea of a ""road-block<strong> intercept</strong>ing"" people can't be used twice, so here's an alternative: The children from the local village (merely <em>commoners</em>) walked up to the overpass of the nearby <em>highway</em> and <strong>intercepted</strong> the communications of passing truckers using their little CB radio."	In Lord of the Rings, the COMMONERS are<strong> INTERCEPT</strong>ED on the ROAD to Helms Deep. Think of the scene where they attacked by the goblins.		
席		seat	Caverns . . . towel.		10	1277	1193	32	セキ	むしろ	Remember those poor commoners huddled in groups of 20 in a cave? The only thing they had for a<strong> seat</strong> was some old toweling (while their lords could recline on luxurious couches).	"PRIMITIVE: <em>Cave</em> + <em>twenty</em> = <strong>Finnish sauna</strong> (instead of Heisig's ""caverns"", which I'd confuse with ""cave""). STORY: You don't directly sit on the wooden<strong> seat</strong> in the <em>sauna</em> – rather, you put a <em>towel</em> underneath."	You're tired from walking the tour at this <em>cavern</em> and there's no benches to sit down on, so you take a <em>towel</em> and sling it up into a hammock-like<strong> seat</strong> using the stalagmites. (Big no-no).	"You're in an onsen <em>cavern</em>, peeping at the pretty young girls wearing only a <em>towel</em>… when suddenly Chris Hansen appears. ""Please take a<strong> seat</strong>""."	If you want to take a<strong> seat</strong> in the <em>caverns</em>, they're often pretty damp - best to lay down a <em>towel</em> first before getting a wet ass.		
度		degrees	This key word refers to a gradation of measurement, not to academic diplomas. Its primitives: <i>caverns</i> . . . <i>crotch</i>.		9	1278	1194	32	ド、ト、タク	たび、-た.い	The <em>cavern refugees</em> are so poor that they can't afford thermometers. So, the menfolk expose their <em>crotches</em> inside the cavern, and approximate the temperature in<strong> degrees</strong> from how shrivelled everything looks downstairs…	The cave is twenty<strong> degrees</strong> cooler than the outdoors. Twenty male crotches experience shrinkage.	"PRIMITIVE: <em>Cave</em> + <em>twenty</em> = <strong>Finnish sauna</strong> (instead of Heisig's ""caverns"", which I'd confuse with ""cave""). STORY: When it gets 95<strong> degrees</strong> Celsius (or 200<strong> degrees</strong> Fahrenheit) in the <em>sauna</em>, you start feeling the heat in your <em>crotch</em>."	You might want to pick a seat in the <em>cavern</em> a little closer to the cooking fire, though. Otherwise, the second you sit down on the cold rocks, the temperature of your <em>crotch</em> will drop about fifty<strong> degrees</strong>!	(Continuing story from previous kanji - thanks matticus) One of the commoners has no towel. As soon as he sits down on the cold rocks of the <em>caverns</em>, the temperature of his <em>crotch</em> drops about fifty<strong> degrees</strong>!		
渡		transit	Water . . . degrees.		12	1279	1195	32	ト	わた.る、-わた.る、わた.す	This particular form of<strong> transit</strong> is a ferry (one of the actual meanings of this character). Naturally it can only cross the <em>water</em> if it's not frozen, so the temperature must be above 0 <em>degrees</em>.	The<strong> transit</strong> system in Tokyo is one of the best in the wrold, but why is it that when it is 35 degrees outside, it is about 2 degrees on the train? Or when it is 2 degrees outside, it is 35 degrees inside the train. This degree of difference means I am always sweating then getting the chills! I think I caught a fever!	Hint: This is most commonly used in わたる, meaning to cross (a river etc) - most of the other readings are fairly obscure. I guess Heisig didn't use that because of the earlier 'crossing' kanji, but there we go. Story: the Dwarves who live in the Arctic caverns develop a<strong> transit</strong> system (perhaps of husky drawn carts) on the frozen <em>water</em> when its -20 <em>degrees</em> so they can cross to the other caverns.	This kanji becomes a snap when you think of a surveyor's instrument called a<strong> transit</strong>! The<strong> transit</strong> has a small, curved <em>liquid</em> tube (with an air bubble) and a scale marked in <em>degrees</em> so you can tell if something is level or not.	<em>Water</em> may change several <em>degrees</em> during<strong> transit</strong>.		
奔		bustle	The hustle and <b>bustle</b> of this character is depicted by a <i>St. Bernard dog</i> and a <i>haystack</i>.		8	1280	1196	32	ホン	はし.る	Hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> = a big <em>St. Bernard dog</em> frisking about in a <em>haystack</em>, knocking it down and spreading the hay about, after the field hands just stacked it up.	A<strong> bustle</strong> is also the name for the big wire-framed skirts that women used to wear. Here's a <em>St. Bernard dog</em> jammed ass-first into the top of a <em>haystack</em>, looking like some kind of proper Victorian-era lady as he struggles to get out.	(note: easier way to remember haystack - it's just as difficult to find a needle in a haystack, even if you use two hands) Farmers hustling and bustling to move big haystacks.	In the hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> of NYC, you suddenly find this humongous <em>haystack</em> and a giant <em>St. Bernard</em> sitting on top of it, howling Christmas songs. Nobody even stops to look….only in NYC.	"- I had trouble using the haystack primitive without ""money"" as in the following frames, so I've separated the elements out to make sure I don't put ""money"" into this kanji. Whenever you come across any<strong> BUSTLE</strong>, there's a simple solution for getting through. Get your St Bernard and prick him with a needle - he'll cut right through the<strong> BUSTLE</strong>. You just have to hold onto him with two hands!"		
噴		erupt	Mouth . . . haystack . . . clams.		15	1281	1197	32	フン	ふ.く	History of Pompei: An unexpect<strong> erupt</strong>ion and from the <em>mouths</em> of the volcano come lava that threatens the farmers collecting <em>haystacks</em> in the fields and the fisherman catching <em>shells</em> on the coast.	A bit nasty (but makes the whole thing much easier to remember) is to take the right side and call it a <em>bearded clam.</em> For<strong> erupt</strong>, you can make your own story about the <em>mouth/opening</em> on the left.	Well, the local farmers stuffed the <em>mouth</em> of the dangerous volcano with <em>haystacks</em>, thinking that would prevent<strong> erupt</strong>ions. Even more stupid was one tourist who threw some sea food (<em>shellfish</em>) into the <em>mouth</em> of the volcano. This caused an instant<strong> erupt</strong>ion of unprecedented magnitude!	After eating some particularly bad <em>clams</em> at a dodgy seafood restaurant, you<strong> erupt</strong> and release them back out through your <em>mouth</em>. You cover up the mess with a <em>haystack</em>.	For <em>30 clams</em>, a prostitute will let you<strong> erupt</strong> in her <em>mouth</em>…..LOL…		
墳		tomb	<i>Soil</i> . . . <i>haystack</i> . . . <i>clams</i>. In order not to confuse this kanji with that for a <i>grave</i> (Frame 246), something like the image of an Egyptian <b>tomb</b> should be adopted, with all its special connotations.		15	1282	1198	32	フン		After the eruption all is a<strong> tomb</strong>. The soil has covered the remains of the farmers gathering <em>haystacks</em> and of the fisherman collecting <em>shells</em>.	Using <em>soil</em> and <em>hay</em> to make bricks, the Egyptians built the pyramids to <strong>entomb</strong> the Pharaohs along with all of their <em>money</em>.	Depending on how much money you have, you can be buried in the hay, in the dirt, or in a<strong> tomb</strong>.	An Egyptian<strong> tomb</strong> is soil molded in the shape of a giant haystack, with all the money of the pharoah burried underneith.	I think I'm gonna puke. That <em>bearded clam</em> has so much dirt in it that it looks like a<strong> tomb</strong> rather than a womb.		
憤		aroused	State of mind . . . haystack . . . clams.		15	1283	1199	32	フン	いきどお.る	"Note: this word in Japanese has the idea of ""indignant"". So<strong> aroused</strong> here refers to being<strong> aroused</strong> because of anger over some unjust or wrong act, unfairness etc. It doesn't seem to carry a meaning associated with arousal in the sense of sex or pleasure. So, my story: think of the angry <em>state of mind</em><strong> aroused</strong> at finding all your <em>clams</em> buried under your <em>haystack</em> stolen, gone!"	<em>Data</em> was <strong>aroused/indignant</strong> when he saw what the volcano had done to the farmers building their <em>haystacks</em> and the fishermen collecting their <em>shells</em> . The tragedy of it all <strong>aroused</strong> him so much he didn't even notice he was feeling emotion.	<strong>Aroused</strong>: the state of mind men are in <em>before</em> their eruption…	Oh boy, does <em>bearded clam</em> ever work for this kanji! I get into an<strong> aroused</strong> state just thinking about it.	After <em>Data</em> got his emotion chip, his anger was<strong> aroused</strong> when he realized he wasn't getting any of that <em>bearded clam</em>.		
焼		bake	<i>Hearth</i> . . . <i>straw man</i>. Take care to distinguish this kanji from <i>cook</i> (Frame 507) and <i>burn</i> (Frame 549) when you compose your story.		12	1284	1200	32	ショウ	や.く、や.き、や.き-、-や.き、や.ける	"Ah, there's no better way to<strong> bake</strong> a pizza than an oven fueled by a <em>burning strawman</em>. And if you listen carefully, there are stifled strawman screams coming from the kitchen.

To the <em>fire</em> goes the <em>straw man</em>, thinking to<strong> bake</strong> a cake on it, but…	The best yakisoba / yakiimo / yakizakana / yakitori / yakiniku / takoyaki / taiyaki / shogayaki / sukiyaki / okonomiyaki / dorayaki / teriyaki / teppanyaki is made by burning a strawman.	I see the <em>strawman</em> as <em>The Wicker Man</em> (which incidentally I would recommend to all!). Without wanting to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it, let's just say that if you have seen the movie, this one is easy!	The straw man burning festival. Burning man music festival. I suppose a lot of people have lighters and matches there so they can get<strong> bake</strong>d, eh?		
暁		daybreak	Sun . . . straw man.		12	1285	1201	32	ギョウ、キョウ	あかつき、さと.る	The <em>sun</em> rising beside a <em>straw man</em> in a corn field is a classic cartoon depiction of<strong> daybreak</strong>.	The first person to see the <em>sun</em> at<strong> daybreak</strong> is of course the <em>straw man</em> who stands outside all <em>day</em>.	<strong>Daybreak</strong> comes and at the touch of the <em>sun</em> all the vampires instantly become <em>straw men</em>!	"<a href=""../v4/30.html"">nightbreak</a> (#30 旦) was yoake 夜明け = or when the night brights up -<strong> daybreak</strong> is a akatsuki (the kun reading of this character), coming from akatoki =明時 which is the exact moment at which the SUN can give life to the STRAWMAN (it used to mean the period of time when it's still dark - before dawn) <a href=""../v4/2448.html"">dawn</a> (#2448 曙) is usually reserved for the figurative sense of beginning of a new era. to keep them separated i'm sorting them chronologically as : 暁 (4 a.m)/曙(5:12:04)/旦(6 a.m)."	I'd like to see a<strong> daybreak</strong> more often but I'm never up that early. So instead, I get my <em>Voodoo Doll</em> and leave it outside facing east. So it sees the <em>sun</em> rise up for me, whilst I'm still sound asleep. (Hey, if it can transfer pain to me, it can transfer beautiful sights like this!).		
半		half	Although the writing order is different, one can remember the appearance of this character by seeing it as a <i>little needle</i> - the kind used for splitting hairs in <b>half</b>. (Again, according to rule, <i>little</i> takes a stroke beneath it in order to be placed over an element that has no horizontal line at the top.)		5	1286	1202	32	ハン	なか.ば	"Imagine karate chopping the number three in<strong> half</strong> with a WALKING STICK and pausing the picture just as the first ""board"" breaks."	I think of this as a pictograph, there are three boards to cut, the first one is already in<strong> half</strong> and there are still two more to go.	What is 1 divided by 2? ONE (vertical stroke) divided by TWO (horizontal strokes) equals one-<strong> HALF</strong>. The ANIMAL-HORNS are your prize for solving this complex math problem.	I karate chopped the first one in<strong> half</strong> but for the next two I needed a walking stick.			
伴		consort	Person . . . half.		7	1287	1203	32	ハン、バン	ともな.う	"The <em>person</em> who is your<strong> consort</strong> is most commonly ""your other <em>half</em>""."	<em>Mr. T</em> wants to splits himself in <em>half</em> so he can be his own<strong> CONSORT</strong>.	MR T's<strong> CONSORT</strong> is only HALF the size that he is (she's Japanese after all).	<em>Mr. T</em> will never take a <strong>consort</strong>. Marriage or nothing! No <em>half</em>-way measures for <em>Mr. T</em>!	The Asari<strong> consort</strong> from Mass Effect looked <em>half human</em>.		
畔		paddy ridge	<i>Rice field</i> . . . <i>half</i>. The key word here refers to the <b>ridges</b> that rise up between the sections of a rice <b>paddy</b>.		10	1288	1204	32	ハン	あぜ、くろ、ほとり	A<strong> PADDY-RIDGE</strong> divides the RICE FIELD in HALF.	Better keyword: waterside (as in lakeside, etc.) words: 河畔 (riverside) 湖畔 (lakeside), 池畔 (by a pond), etc. New keyword captures most common meaning, and avoids confusion with 畦 , which means ONLY<strong> paddy-ridge</strong>. story: A rice field is divided in half, half is field half is water. If you stand at the halfway mark, you are at the waterside.	Think about a large <em>rice field</em> as a big square. Then you draw a line down the middle, <em>halving</em> it into two. Then you draw a line across the middle, <em>halving</em> it again into four… These halvings are <strong>paddy-ridges</strong> that separate the rice field into separate sections. I dunno the reason why, but that's how it's done.	"<a href=""Http://www.fotosearch.com/bigcomp.asp?path=UPC/UPC004/pss32184.jpg"">Http://www.fotosearch.com/bigcomp.asp?path=UPC/UPC004/pss32184.jpg</a> a paddy ridge divides the rice fileds in halves."	If you keep dividing the <em>rice paddy</em> in <em>half</em>, and in <em>half</em> again, and again, you'll get more and more <strong>paddy-ridges</strong>.		
判		judgment	<i>Half</i> . . . <i>saber</i>. You might recall the famous <b>judgment</b> of King Solomon, who offered to slice a baby in two with a <i>saber</i> to give <i>half</i> to each of the mothers who claimed it as her own.		7	1289	1205	32	ハン、バン	わか.る	In the bible, King Solomon's<strong> JUDGMENT</strong> was admired not by saying to cut the baby in HALF with the SWORD, but that it revealed who the true mother was.	It takes good judgement to cut things in exactly half with a saber.	See book. Solomon made his<strong> judgment</strong> and decided to cut a baby in half with his saber. Good thing he found the real mom before that happened!	Heisig's story is perfect.	"Judge Judy: "" You cut the couch in <em>half</em> with your <em>saber</em>. It doesn't matter if you did it by accident because you tripped with a <em>saber</em> in your hand. What were you doing carrying a <em>saber</em> anyway!<strong> Judgment</strong> for the plaintiff in the amount of 1000 dollars""."		
拳		fist	<i>Quarter</i> . . . <i>hand</i>. Be careful to keep this key word distinct from the primitive element of the same meaning we met back in Frame 741.		10	1290	2917	32	ケン、ゲン	こぶし	1) I hold a roll of <em>quarters</em> in my <em>hand</em> when I make a<strong> fist</strong>. 2) I hold a <em>quarter</em> in my <em>hand</em> as I prepare to play the Iron<strong> Fist</strong> Tournament: 鉄拳 （てっけん） at the arcade.	Quarter, hand: If you have a roll of <em>quarters</em> in your <em>hand</em>, your<strong> fist</strong> will deliver a much more effective punch.	及 <strong> fist</strong>* His<strong> fist</strong> is a QUARTER the size of his open HAND.	A<strong> fist</strong> is a <em>hand</em> that offers no <em>quarter</em>.	Your <em>hand</em> may only be a <em>quarter</em> of its usual size with the fingers spread out when you make a<strong> fist</strong> but it looks a lot tougher.		
券		ticket	Quarter . . . dagger.		8	1291	1206	32	ケン		Entering the movie, the dude asks for your <strong>ticket</strong>, so he can tear it in half. He looks at you funny when you hand him a<strong> ticket</strong> already torn in half. He quietly tears the stub into <em>quarter</em>s after you show him your <em>dagger</em> with a smile.	In Japan, the JR railway ju-hachi-kippu seasonal discount<strong> ticket</strong> can be cut into <em>quarters</em> with a <em>dagger</em> and shared with your friends. (its actually sort-of true).	Typically, about one <em>quarter</em> of a<strong> ticket</strong> with be separated by a perforated edge which the<strong> ticket</strong> guy will tear off when you are at the gate. However, this kanji was made waaay before perforated edges were invented. It used to be that the guy would cut off a <em>quarter</em> of your<strong> ticket</strong> with a <em>dagger</em>.	"Fact #1: A QUARTER of all<strong> TICKET</strong>S are obtained with DAGGERS."	While a quarter may not buy you a<strong> ticket</strong>, a dagger will; if you know what I mean.		
巻		scroll	<i>Quarter</i> . . . <i>snake</i>.

"As a prank, a guy sits with his butt <em>flesh</em> on the<strong> facsimile</strong> machine, inserts a <em>quarter</em>, and tries to fax it to his boss. However the<strong> facsimile</strong> machine has pattern recognition technology and instead of an image of his <em>flesh</em>, it just transmits the <em>word</em> ""asshole"". Don't forget it's flesh, not words, on the left side; the flesh image gets transformed into words."	When you send a<strong> facsimile</strong> to the <em>moon</em> it costs a <em>quarter</em> per <em>word</em>.	What used to take a <em>month</em> to re-scribe only a <em>quarter</em> of the <em>words</em>, the modern technology of a <strong>Xerox</strong> or even <strong>mimeograph</strong> or<strong> facsimile</strong> reproduces them them in moments.	It really is a quite acceptable <strong>fax</strong>. It's just in the <em>moon</em> light, you can only read a <em>quarter</em> of the <em>words</em>.		
片		one-sided	This kanji is based on the pictograph of a tree with some branches going upwards and others hanging down, split right down the middle. When that picture's right side is isolated, it becomes the kanji for <b>one-sided</b>, in the sense of only one part of a whole.		4	1297	1212	32	ヘン	かた-、かた	Fuaburisu's pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife is a<strong> one-sided</strong> version of the story. Others say he was giving her the finger.	Taking the keyword in the sense of only one part of a whole, I see this as a pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife (I couldn't see any trees or branches in there).	A<strong> one-sided</strong> romance–he proposes and she says no. (Thanks to fuaburisu).	If you look at this image from <strong>one side</strong>, it looks like the <strong>top hat</strong> is floating over a <strong>chair</strong>.	"There is also other side (left-side) of the tree, which is the kanji - 爿(radical no. 90, which has the meaning of ""piece of wood"" and was earlier used in <a href=""../v4/239.html"">status quo</a> (#239 状), <a href=""../v4/321.html"">robust</a> (#321 壮), <a href=""../v4/731.html"">leader</a> (#731 将), but then was simplified to ""half-turtle"" element). Now put them together - 爿片 - and you can see a tree."		
版		printing block	"Although this character also carries the sense of an ""edition"" of a publication, the elements, <i>one-sided</i> and <i>anti-</i>, more readily suggest its other meaning of a <b>printing block</b>."		8	1298	1213	32	ハン		Before the advent of printers in Japan, typewriters couldn't be built as they were in the west due to how many kanji there are. Lots of small<strong> printing block</strong>s had to be used instead. <em>One side</em> of the<strong> printing block</strong> would have a mirrored (<em>anti</em>) image of the kanji. This is true.	Nazi propaganda. Picture the <strong>printing blocks</strong> producing very <em>one-sided</em> (Aryan), <em>anti</em>-Jewish propaganda spreading posters to hang around town.	<strong>Printing block</strong> has a <em>one-sided</em> <em>anti-image</em> of what's being printed.	"<strong>Printing block</strong>s are one-sided and have ""anti-image"" of the page carved into them (the background-colored areas are engraved, not the text)."	Picture teams of monks copying scriptures… before the advent of<strong> printing block</strong>s, documents were copied by hand. The copyists were able to get away with making slight omissions & changes when they didn't agree with the source documents, resulting in <strong>one-sided</strong> versions of the original text. The invention of the<strong> printing block</strong> ensured all copies would be identical to the original; thus it is <strong>anti-one-sided</strong>.		
之		of	This character is now used chiefly in proper names, and is best learned as the character closest to the hiragana え, though in fact it has no relation to it.	* In order to give this kanji a more concrete meaning when it is used as a primitive element, think of it as referring to <i>building blocks</i> with the hiragana written on them, much the same as the A-B-C blocks you played with as a child.	3	1299	1214	32	シ	の、これ、おいて、ゆく、この	<strong>Of</strong> all the kanji, this is the only one 之 orro can write.	The Z<strong> of</strong> Zorro (and yes he has a hat).	"""Hey Zorro, would you sign my chest?"" ""Why<strong> of</strong> course!"" Long story short: he didn't use a pen…"	The mark <strong>of</strong> 之 orro!	My kanji dictionaries state that this is an alternate kanji for これ (<strong>this one</strong>) ( 此れ being the other form). It looks like a very small <em>person</em> 人 who lifts a <em>hat</em> with his <em>arm</em>. I like to think<strong> of</strong> him as a <em>gardener</em> with a Panama Hat, but it could also be the almighty Zorro!		
乏		destitution	Drop of . . . building blocks.		4	1300	1215	32	ボウ	とぼ.しい、とも.しい	Just one <em>drop</em> (of alcohol) and he starts walking in <em>zig-zags</em> – no wonder <em>Zorro</em>'s living in<strong> destitution</strong>. (Note: As a primitive let 之 be <em>Zorro</em> or <em>Zig-Zag</em>: it's pictographic).	Children in complete<strong> destitution</strong> have no hope of ever getting toys to play with, so when they find even a tiny <em>drop</em> of a <em>building block</em> they are overjoyed.	The people living in<strong> destitution</strong> POOR. Zorro gives them every drop he has: drops of sweat while fighting, drops of blood when he is cut down,… even the senorita gets some drops.	<em>Zorro</em> helps prostitutes living in<strong> destitution</strong>. He gives them money, in return they allow him to cover them in <em>drops of Zorro</em>. What a philanthropist! (thanks filip!).	"This is bad story, but whatever, it works, I was having real trouble with this kanji: On those Sunday morning World Vision shows you see African children living in total<strong> destitution</strong>, often wearing some wacky T-shirt that was popular in the West back in the 80's or something. Now see one little <strong>destitute</strong> child wearing a T-shirt that reads ""A Drop of Zorro."" A <em>Drop of Zorro</em>? What the hell? I don't remember that movie!"		
芝		turf	Flowers . . . building blocks.		6	1301	1216	32	シ	しば	"Zorro, with a flower between his teeth for the ladies, defends his<strong> turf</strong> against evildoers. ""This is my<strong> turf</strong>! And this…is for the lady.""."	Artificial<strong> turf</strong> made easy: <em>flowers</em> stuck on top of <em>building blocks</em> that you can place anywhere.	ZORRO tried to plant FLOWERS but found his lawn was made of astro-TURF.	You know that when you see a flower bed in the shape of a Z that you're on Zorro's<strong> turf</strong>.	Ever seen<strong> turf</strong> rolled out like carpet on a new block? Here a roll of<strong> turf</strong> is unfurled and inside of it was <em>Zorro</em> with a <em>flower</em> in his mouth. Some people are just that smooth…		
不		negative	You may play with the primitives of this kanji as you wish (<i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>person</i> . . . <i>a drop of</i>), <i>but</i> you will probably find that its simplicity, and its frequency, make it easy to remember just as it is.		4	1302	1217	32	フ、ブ		"[Smithsonian] Scene: <em>Mr. T</em> hanging from the <em>ceiling</em> being tortured. He is asked if he is going to talk. Spitting (a <em>drop</em> of saliva) in the torturer's face, he says ""Negative""."	<em>One below</em> zero is a<strong> negative</strong> number.	If just ONE PERSON has a DROP of NEGATIVITY it can make everyone<strong> NEGATIVE</strong>.	A minus sign with an arrow pointing up at it, indicating that this is the symbol that means<strong> negative</strong>.	Anything smaller than 1 is<strong> negative</strong>.

Negative mouths<strong> negate</strong> everything.	"I get this mixed up with <a href=""../v4/1217.html"">negative</a> (#1217 不). The difference here is that someone <strong>ate</strong> the <em>negative</em> to<strong> negate</strong> it."	"Tip: this is much better learned as ""SAY NO"", negation coming out of a mouth, easy to remember if you have kids."	"Hint: This is the old kanji writing of the word ""<strong>いいえ</strong>"" (no), which is a negative word coming out of your mouth.

杯		cupfuls	Tree . . . negative.		8	1304	1219	32	ハイ	さかずき	The maple <strong>tree</strong> is very <strong>negative</strong> about it, but the farmer still collects <em>cupfuls</em> of maple syrup from it.

"The kanji for いっぱい is <a href=""midori://search?text=%E4%B8%80%E6%9D%AF%EF%BC%8E"">一杯．</a> One cup is great, two cups still good, but if you have so many<strong> cupfuls</strong> that you pass out under a <em>tree</em>, the situation has turned <em>negative</em>."	A wooden cup is a piece of <em>wood</em> with <em>negative</em> space waiting to be filled by the <em>cupfuls</em>.	If you want the <em>tree</em> to show <em>negative</em> growth, you should use a few <strong>cupsful</strong> of poison every day.		
矢		dart	"When shot high into the <i>heavens</i>, the <b>dart</b> gets so small it looks like a mere <i>drop</i>. Although this character could as well mean ""arrow,"" it has no connection with the primitive of that meaning. Hence the new key word."		5	1305	1220	33	シ	や	Zeus ran out of lightning bolts and has to drop<strong> dart</strong>s from the heavens.	Do not mistake with LOSE 失 .	I lost 845 失 the tip to my<strong> dart</strong> 矢 .	<strong>Dart</strong>s are like <em>drops</em> falling from <em>heaven</em>. I see massive falling<strong> dart</strong>s from a scene in Babylon 5. I think they were either Shadow weapons or weapons used to attack the Shadows…	The 11th and not so well-known plague of Egypt:<strong> Dart</strong>s falling like <em>drops</em> from <em>heaven</em>. Imagine a<strong> dart</strong>board over the map of Egypt, with Cairo in the centre, and the angels of heaven playing a round of<strong> dart</strong>. But be sure to also see it from the Egyptians perspective: the drops.		
矯		rectify	<i>Dart</i> . . . <i>angel</i>.

族		tribe	Banner . . . dart.		11	1307	1222	33	ゾク		"With a <em>banner</em> declaring ""Keep Out!"" and blow <em>darts</em> to back it up, the Amazon<strong> tribe</strong> is not that friendly."	Once<strong> tribe</strong>s shot <em>darts</em> under their war <em>banners</em>, now they are putting <em>banner</em> ads on the internet for betting on <em>dart</em>-games at their casinos :(.	<strong>TRIBE</strong>S in Japan either have BANNERS (samurai) or poisoned DARTS (ninja).	Hint: This most commonly occurs in 家族 (かぞく, <strong>family</strong>), and <strong>family</strong> is not taken, so I'm renaming this kanji to <strong>family</strong>. Story (thanks Hawkeye123): When I'm playing <em>darts</em> at home, I put a <em>banner</em> on the door so my <strong>family</strong> doesn't enter my room and get stung by a <em>dart</em>.	An Amamzonian<strong> TRIBE</strong> puts a BANNER outside their village that reads: we have DARTS!!

智		wisdom	Know . . . sun.		12	1309	1224	33	チ		<strong>Wisdom</strong> is knowing everything OVER the sun (fools assume everything UNDER).	<em>Knowing</em> more each <em>day</em>, brings<strong> wisdom</strong>.	<strong>Wisdom</strong> is the <em>knowledge</em> gained by the passing of <em>days</em>.	"<strong>Wisdom</strong> is a kind of <em>knowledge</em> that ""enlightens"" and brings warmth to others, just like the <em>sun</em> does."

Your <em>fingers</em> slip when someone's <em>elbow</em><strong> shove</strong>s you, causing you to drop the <em>dart</em> you were about to throw. But as you can see, their elbow is very small, so you decide they're too weak to<strong> shove</strong> back.	You're scared to do your introduction ( 挨拶 ）, so a giant FINGER appears to<strong> shove</strong> you in front of the class. You land on your ELBOW, and the class shoots DARTS at you for falling.	(+astridtops) In the crowded bar, someone<strong> shove</strong>s an <em>elbow</em> into you just as you are about to throw your <em>dart</em>. The <em>dart</em> slips from your <em>fingers</em>. You are just about to curse at the person when you realize that she is your Japanese teacher. You bow and greet [ 挨拶 (あいさつ): greeting, salutation] her instead. 挨拶回り (あいさつまわり): New Year courtesy calls 挨拶状 (あいさつじょう): greeting card.	I <strong>shoved</strong> him with my <em>fingers</em>. Then he <strong>shoved</strong> me with his <em>elbow</em>. Then I threw <em>darts</em> at him. Then he killed me :-(.		
矛		halberd	The <b>halberd's</b> battle-ax head and long shaft are depicted here. Take care with the number and order of the strokes.		5	1311	1225	33	ム、ボウ	ほこ	マオ Zedong always carried a<strong> halberd</strong>.	Make the<strong> halberd</strong> a heroic warrior (perhaps of scandinavian origin) who weilds this polearm - the most effective, brutal and vicious one - with great skill. He can use it to hook, pierce and chop (the three strokes).	Mao (マオ) gets his head chopped off by a<strong> halberd</strong>.	<strong>Halberd</strong>: A weapon of the 15th and 16th centuries having an axlike <em>blade</em> and a steel <em>spike</em> mounted on the end of a long <em>shaft</em>. <strong>Pictograph:</strong> Take a moment to see its different parts. The upper マ is the <em>blade</em>, the horizontal line belongs to the <em>shaft</em>, and finally the lower vertical line is the <em>spike</em>.	It looks a lot like child. Picture a powerful warrior cutting a child's head off with a<strong> halberd</strong>. You can see the head removed from the body and the slashing<strong> halberd</strong>.		
柔		tender	Halberd . . . tree.		9	1312	1226	33	ジュウ、ニュウ	やわ.らか、やわ.らかい、やわ、やわ.ら	[tender; weakness; gentleness; softness] Love me <strong>tender</strong>, Love me perfect, Never cheat on me. Or I'll impale you on my <em>Halberd</em>, And hang ya atop a <em>tree</em>…	Use a <em>halberd</em> to<strong> tender</strong>ize a <em>tree</em>: <em>halberds</em> can chop, poke, and slash, so it's all good!	I like my steak<strong> tender</strong>. That's why I impale it with a <em>halberd</em> and smash it against a tree to<strong> tender</strong>ize it.	"The poor warrior wanted to eat a<strong> tender</strong> steak but all he could find was a slab of <em>wood</em>. He chops at and beats at the <em>wood</em> with his <em>halberd</em> until it becomes<strong> tender</strong> so that he can imagine eating a<strong> tender</strong> steak. Primitive placement: remember the halberd is on top pounding down on the wood below. Careful: <a href=""../v4/993.html"">tenderness</a> (#993 優)."	Seeing all the children he orphaned, the now<strong> tender</strong> knight hung his <em>halberd</em> up on a <em>tree</em>, permanently.		
務		task	Halberd . . . taskmaster . . . muscle.		11	1313	1227	33	ム	つと.める	It is with the <em>halberd</em> he holds that the <em>taskmaster</em> exerts his <em>power</em> over those actually performing the<strong> task</strong>.	"So many video games have a ""boss"" stage you must pass in order to advance to the next level. Here, your<strong> task</strong> is to use your <em>halberd</em> to beat the <em>taskmaster</em> with the huge, bulging <em>muscles</em>."	The most <em>powerful<strong> task</strong>master</em> knows how to multi-<strong>task</strong>. Here he's given himself the impossible<strong> task</strong> of <em>halberd</em> sparring with one arm, and <em>muscle</em> building with the other - and he's succeeding!	A first RPG<strong> task</strong>–not even a full quest, just a<strong> task</strong> some random dude gives you (you always have to start off with some stupid weapon and go kill some other random dude, for no reason). Here, take this <em>halberd</em> I happen to have lying around. Now go kill the <em>taskmaster</em> and his hired-<em>muscle</em> UNDERling.	Your<strong> task</strong> is: take the <em>halberd</em> from the huge <em>taskmaster</em> with all the bulging <em>muscles</em>.		
霧		fog	Weather/rain . . . task.		19	1314	1228	33	ム、ボウ、ブ	きり	This<strong> fog</strong> is the perfect <em>weather</em> for us to perform our <em>task</em> undetected.	<strong>FOG</strong> is easy to associate with the RAIN primitive. So think of<strong> FOG</strong> as a type of RAIN that is slow at the TASK of getting the place wet.	<em>Rain</em>'s <em>task</em> is to get rid of the <strong>fog</strong>.	In Persona 4, your <em>task</em> is to rescue people before <em>rain</em> falls and the<strong> fog</strong> sets in.	Rain + Task:<strong> Fog</strong> makes driving in the <em>rain</em> a hazardous <em>task</em>.		
班		squad	Spear . . . two balls.		10	1315	1229	33	ハン		"Am I the only one who took this as penis and balls? In order to be in the man-squad, naturally you need to have two balls with your ""spear"" in the middle there."	Here we have two kings trying out for the cheer-leading<strong> squad</strong>. A spear on the floor separates their dancing areas.	King Leonidas from the movie 300 throws his spear at Xerxes (the Persian king) trying to kill him as his<strong> squad</strong> of spartins make their last stand.	If you have a SPEAR and TWO BALLS you have no business being on a cheerleading<strong> SQUAD</strong>.	A long<strong> SQUAD</strong> of men carrying SPEARS keep the two rival KINGS separated, so that they won't fight.		
帰		homecoming	<i>Spear</i> . . . <i>broom</i> . . . <i>apron</i>. The character for <i>lady</i> (Frame 1234) shares the same right side as this character, which does not bode for a very happy <b>homecoming</b>.		10	1316	1230	33	キ	かえ.る、かえ.す、おく.る、とつ.ぐ	A female warrior returns home from battle. Her husband takes away her <em>spear</em> to symbolize the end of fighting and gives her a <em>broom</em> and an <em>apron</em>. “Boy, this is some kind of <strong>HOMECOMING</strong>,” thinks the veteran. (Adapted from johnskb).	Our high school theme was tradition. They gave the<strong> homecoming</strong> king a <em>spear</em> and the<strong> homecoming</strong> queen a <em>broom</em> and <em>apron</em>.	"Well, the boss man warrior upon his<strong> homecoming</strong> has set aside his spear. Remember the <a href=""../v4/1151.html"">lady</a> (#1151 婦) (who put aside her broom and apron)? I wonder what they're doing now?"	A veteran returns home from battle. The village chief takes away his SPEAR to symbolize the end of fighting and gives him a BROOM and an APRON to begin his new career as a hotel maid. “Boy, this is some kind of<strong> HOMECOMING</strong>,” thinks the veteran.	At the<strong> homecoming</strong>, the man drops his spear, while the women drops her broom and removes her apron. Cherishing the moment that they are reunited.		
弓		bow	This character pictures the bent wooden <b>bow</b>. Later we will learn how to make the <i>bowstring</i> that goes with it (Frame 1490). If you stretch this character out and see the indentation on the left as its handle, the pictography should be clearer.		3	1317	1231	33	キュウ	ゆみ	My personification for this primative is Legolas from the Lord of the Rings: a master at the<strong> bow</strong>. I suppose robin hood etc would work too.	I have a<strong> BOW</strong> made from a SNAKE that I BOUND UP. He sure wasn't happy!

引		pull	Bow . . . walking stick.		4	1318	1232	33	イン	ひ.く、ひ.き、ひ.き-、-び.き、ひ.ける	Put a <em>walking stick</em> in the <em>bow</em> and<strong> pull</strong> it back, ready to fire at the geezer.	This is actually a bow and an arrow. (Real origin of this kanji).<strong> Pull</strong> and release to fire!	Legolas catches Frodo<strong> pull</strong>ing on his <em>walking stick</em>. I'll let you decide what that means exactly.	If you<strong> pull</strong> at the ends of a <em>bow</em> long enough, you'll deform it to make a decent <em>walking stick</em>. This was a tactic used by injured archers to escape battle.	This is the story of Odysseus’ great <em>bow</em>, here we see it as the <em>bow</em> both strung(as <em>bow</em>) and unstrung(as <em>walking stick</em>). The challenge was given by Odysseus' wife (Penelope) to see who had strength enough to<strong> pull</strong> the bow and string it.		
弔		condolences	<i>A bow</i> . . . wrapped around a <i>walking stick</i>.		4	1319	1233	33	チョウ	とむら.う、とぶら.う	Perhaps a pictograph of a soldier's weapons–his sword and bow-placed ceremonially over his body before burial, while people offer their<strong> condolences</strong>.	"Send your<strong> condolences</strong> to the old geezer whom you shot the <em>walking stick</em> into with your <em>bow</em>. (see <a href=""../v4/1232.html"">pull</a> (#1232 引))."	"Don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/985.html"">reparation</a> (#985 償), <a href=""../v4/476.html"">compensation</a> (#476 賠).<strong> Condolences</strong> aren't monetary or physical; it's just a letter. ""Dear wife, your bungling soldier husband tried to string his <em>bow</em> with his <em>walking stick</em>, which of course failed. He was promptly killed by enemy fire. Our<strong> condolences</strong>.""."	"A dead soldier's <em>bow</em> and <em>walking staff</em> unceremoniously delivered to his widow with a note: ""Our<strong> condolences</strong>"". That's it. Heartless. At least ""consolation"" has some ""heart"". [In case you used a soldier's death in both stories]."	The enemy archer kills your friend. Then, seeing how upset you are, he mocks you by offering his<strong> condolences</strong> by using his <em>bow</em> and <em>walking stick</em> like a violin to play a sad song.		
弘		vast	Bow . . . elbow.		5	1320	1234	33	コウ、グ	ひろ.い	If you pull the bow back with your elbow, you can shoot a<strong> vast</strong> distance.	The valley was so<strong> vast</strong> that if you yelled <em>elbow!</em> you could hear it echo <em>bow, bow, bow</em>.	This land is so<strong> vast</strong>, I have plenty of elbow room to pull on and shoot my bow.	<em>Legolas</em> pulls back his <em>elbow</em> so he can fire a<strong> vast</strong> distance. I think of the part of 'The Two Towers' when they are chasing the orcs who have captured Merry and Pippen. They were covering a<strong> vast</strong> area.	In ancient times, feudal lords agreed on a method to fairly distribute land. Each lord would stand on the top of a different hill and shoot an arrow by pulling back on the <em>bow</em> at exactly the length from hand to <em>elbow</em>. The arrow's distance would serve as the radius of his new<strong> vast</strong> territory.		
強		strong	<i>Vast</i> . . . <i>insect</i>. Note how the <i>elbow</i> of <i>vast</i> is shrunken and elevated to make room for the <i>insect</i> beneath.		11	1321	1235	33	キョウ、ゴウ	つよ.い、つよ.まる、つよ.める、し.いる、こわ.い	An insect who can fly vast distances is<strong> strong</strong>.	The <em>vast</em> majority of <em>insect</em>s are pretty<strong> strong</strong>; ants can carry 10x their weight!	There was once a legendary archer, who was known for being incredibly<strong> strong</strong>. In reality he was very weak but had a powerful <em>insect friend</em> who tugged on his <em>elbow</em> while pulling on his <em>bow</em> and arrow.	Legolas is so <strong>strong</strong> that he can even shoot down <em>vast</em> numbers of tiny <em>insects</em> at <em>vast</em> distances with ease.	When using a <em>bow</em>, you need a<strong> strong</strong> arm, and a steady <em>elbow</em> to hit an <em>insect</em>.		
弥		more and more	Bow . . . reclining . . . little.		8	1322	2241	33	ミ、ビ	いや、や、あまねし、いよいよ、とおい、ひさし、ひさ.しい、わた.る	If I <em>recline</em> back, I can pull my <em>bow</em> open a <em>little</em><strong> more and more</strong>.	<strong>More and more</strong> <em>bows</em> were made to kill people, until they were <em>laid down</em> for better <em>small</em>er guns.	The <em>bow</em> dug<strong> more and more</strong> into the <em>small</em> of his back as he <em>reclined</em> on it. Will someone please tell the idiot to get up?	<em>Little</em> Clark Kent, who was found <em>reclining</em> in his spaceship as a baby, grew<strong> more and more</strong> stronger over the years, and found he could fly as fast as an arrow shot by a <em>bow</em>.	<strong>More and more</strong> archers shoot their <em>bow</em>s while <em>reclining</em> a <em>little</em>. It's a very popular stance.		
弱		weak	<i>Two bows</i> . . with <i>ice</i> on them.		10	1323	1236	33	ジャク	よわ.い、よわ.る、よわ.まる、よわ.める	Two<strong> weak</strong> archers agree on a duel to the death. They constantly shoot at each other but never manage to hit their target. But what they lack in skill they make up in determination, and they keep shooting for hours, and days, and months, until it's wintertime and their <em>bows</em> are coated in <em>ice</em>.	BOWS with ICE on them are brittle and<strong> WEAK</strong>.	I'm missing this Kanji too much, so here's another take: Look at the two BOWS and you'll see it looks like FEATHERS at the base of the BOWS. So, imagine two indian children who are still too<strong> WEAK</strong> to pull a real bow, so their parents make two BOWS from two long FEATHERS. Now the<strong> WEAK</strong> children can pretend they have real BOWS. Two FEATHER BOWS.	<em>Two bows</em> with <em>ice</em> on them are still<strong> weak</strong>er than one bow without.	These two archers are so <strong>weak</strong> it's just as if their <em>bows</em> were shooting <em>feathers</em>.		
溺		drowning	"<i>Water</i> . . . <i>weak</i>. Do not confuse the meaning of this key word with ""Drown"" (Frame 763), which is closer to ""founder."""		13	1324	2308	33	デキ、ジョウ、ニョウ	いばり、おぼ.れる	Weak people placed in the water start<strong> drowning</strong>.

When his daughter used a lot of <em>water</em> for her shower, the father could practically see the <em>dollar signs</em>, so he was <strong>seething</strong> with anger.	This kanji is more closely related to water and emotions boiling.

The<strong> No.</strong>1 currency may at one time have been the dollar, but since the economic slowdown the <em>weak dollar</em> has been overtaken by currencies from <em>bamboo</em> growing countries. (Thanks to Johnnyltn for the idea.) Using the alternate writing of the dollar primitive as weak dollar.	<em>Bamboo</em> <em>bling</em> is the newest Asian Rapper,<strong> No.</strong> 1 on the charts right now.	The pole vaulter wants to be<strong> No.</strong> 1, so designs a <em>bamboo</em> pole with <em>dollar signs</em> painted on it. (The shape of a pole signifies this is the 1-stroke $).	Even in the <em>bamboo</em> forests of Southeast Asia, the <em>US Dollar</em> is the<strong> No.</strong> 1 currency in demand. (well, it is true of Cambodia at least).

I think of the<strong> COPY</strong> of the CROWN that was BESTOWED upon David after he slew Goliath with ONE SLING.		
身		somebody	The key word <b>somebody</b> was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the <i>nose</i> (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for <i>oneself</i>). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of <b>somebody</b> with a prominent paunch.		7	1337	1248	34	シン	み	"<strong>Somebody</strong> was just looking for you.

老		old man	"First, do not confuse this character with <i>venerable old man</i> (Frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an <b>old man</b> begins with an abbreviation of the character for <i>somebody</i>, the <i>nose</i> having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the <i>soil</i> drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when ""dust to dust"" begins to take on a personal meaning; the diagonal <i>walking stick</i> for getting around; and the <i>spoon</i> for being spoon-fed."	* As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted so that they can be replaced with other elements.	6	1340	1251	34	ロウ	お.いる、ふ.ける	An<strong> old man</strong>, wondering what it's like in a grave, <em>sits</em> in a freshly dug plot. When a gravekeeper mistakes him for dead and begins burying him with <em>soil</em>, the<strong> old man</strong> saves himself by flailing his <em>walking stick</em> in the air.	The <em>dirty</em><strong> old man</strong> had a <em>stroke</em> so now he must be <em>spoon</em> fed.	<strong>Old man</strong> sits in the dirt, having a stroke.	"An<strong> OLD MAN</strong> in a Japanese nursing home must follow the rules: <em>no</em> <em>spoon</em>ing the nurses or <em>soil</em>ing pants. (The slash is like a katakana ""no"" : ノ)."	Old men soil themselves, have diagonal walking sticks, and must be spoon fed.

For the radical on the right, I suggest using <em>zipper</em> instead of <em>scissors</em> (chosen by Heisig merely because it slighty looks like one), as I found it made this batch a walk in the park.

A <em>pack of wild dogs</em>, waiting in a very<strong> cramped</strong> waiting room, to get their hair cut by <em>Edward Scissors Hands</em>, who is very popular.	It's far too <em>cramped</em> on the train. You see that there is a guy with a <em>pack of wild dogs</em>, held only by a ribbon. You saunter up to him, and as the train doors open, you casually snip the ribbon with your <em>scissors</em>. Sensing that they are free, the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> spring into action and chase everyone on the car out, including their owner.

She's a bit of a musical maestro herself AND she has an amazing butt, so all the bases are covered. Plus the radical looks like a 'B'! So this kanji is a pictograph of me <strong>chasing</strong> gorgeous <em>Beyonce</em> down the <em>road</em>. Mmm, Beyonce! (drool). 追う おう run after, drive out; 追い付く おいつく overtake, catch up (with); 追放 ついほう banishment, exile; 追加 ついか supplement, addition.	I use Bond for the Maestro (the primitive also resembles B).

The maestro hangs the towel from the ceiling.

I like to recall<strong> commander</strong> in conjuntion with <em>expert.</em> Both are <em>maestros</em> with <em>towels</em> – however, there is no upper limit (no <em>ceiling</em>) to what a<strong> commander</strong> can achieve in comparison to a mere expert.	The greatest of them all;<strong> Commander</strong> James Bond, 007. Here he is the <em>maestro</em> of undressing women, removing the <em>towel</em> from some bond girl. Of course the towel symbolises her last vestige of resistance.	Here we see <em>James Bond</em> as the ultimate<strong> Commander</strong>.

Our world of today, <em>cars</em> <em>mingling</em> on busy streets, is in stark<strong> contrast</strong> to the one of yesteryear, where it was people who would <em>mingle</em> on the streets.	So Darth Vader tried to mingle with the earthlings, wearing his top hat. People were willing to forget his suit, but the Deathstar parked next to the other cars.

Tip : best avoid the generic image of a human<strong> leg</strong>, and use that of a <em>wooden<strong> leg</strong></em>. As a primitive, the image of a pirate can easily stand for the <em>wooden<strong> leg</strong></em>. As for this kanji, I think James Heisig provided a story, which worked well enough for me.	I'm gonna mend your mouth with my 3rd<strong> leg</strong> ;).	I picture Seamus, the peg-<strong>leg</strong> sailor from Family Guy.

My ex-girlfriend suffered a car accident and had her leg amputated. Ever since the accident, she's been completely irrational. I had to break up with her, so I drove out a few states away and called her from a public phone. Naturally she flipped out, and out of nowhere came this <em>gigantic wooden leg</em> aimed straight at the telephone booth.

A girl with a wooden leg always wanted to play<strong> hop</strong>scotch with the other girls, but every time she tried to<strong> hop</strong> she'd lose her balance and injure another girl. That's why the other girls make fun of her and see her presence as a portent to injury.	Captain Ahab's <em>peg leg</em> is so sensitive to Moby Dick's presence that when Ahab starts<strong> hop</strong>ping around the deck, it <em>portends</em> trouble.	Don't<strong> hop</strong>!

REF: <a href=""../v4/576.html"">weekday</a> (#576 曜) , <a href=""../v4/577.html"">laundry</a> (#577 濯), <em>leap</em> (FRAME 1285), <a href=""../v4/2272.html"">outstanding</a> (#2272 擢), <a href=""../v4/2534.html"">twinkle</a> (#2534 燿), <a href=""../v4/2880.html"">shimmering</a> (#2880 耀). Story: I<strong> leap</strong> out of bed so fast that my <em>wooden leg</em> gets left behind in the <em>futon</em>."	The <em>turkey</em> with a <em>peg leg</em> is trying to<strong> leap</strong> across the canyon. He flaps his wings wildly and <em>feathers </em> fly but he doesn't make it.	I've always imagined a<strong> leap</strong> involving one leg instead of two, which would be a jump. Using your only good <em>leg</em> for propulsion, not the <em>pegleg</em>, you try to<strong> leap</strong> over the canyon. Even with the aid of <em>feathers</em>, you fly like a <em>turkey</em> and fall like stone. This is very Roadrunneresque.		
践		tread	Wooden leg . . . parade float.		13	1380	1286	34	セン	ふ.む	The pirate with the <em>wooden leg</em> chased after the <em>parade float</em> and was run over by the next one, leaving<strong> tread</strong> marks all over him and his leg.	Pirates must<strong> tread</strong> carefully when walking on <em>parade floats</em>, so as not to break through the weak plaster with their <em>wooden legs</em>.	Did Jesus actually<strong> tread</strong> on water? or maybe his <em>wooden leg</em> just allowed him to <em>float</em>.	At our natsu-matsuri they fixed auto-powered moving <em>wooden leg</em>s to the <em>parade float</em>. It looked like a big festival insect and it was all great until it started going crazy and began to <strong>tread</strong> on all the little Japanese kids… I can still hear them screaming in terror.	"Note: I am playing on the meaning of the keyword in order to remember it through a more graphic image. Someone dressed like a pirate (<em>wooden leg</em>) comes down from the pirate-themed <em>float</em> (a vehicle in a carnival), to check the<strong> tread</strong> on the tyres. The actual keyword meaning is a verb (i.e. ""to trample"", ""to carry through"")."		
踏		step	The meaning of this character is virtually identical with that of the last frame. Be sure to come up with distinct connotations suggested by phrases in which each is commonly used. <i>Wooden leg</i> . . . <i>water</i> . . . <i>sun</i>.		15	1381	1287	34	トウ	ふ.む、ふ.まえる	You have to watch your<strong> step</strong> when moving your <em>leg</em> on a <em>watery day</em>.	"So, we've walked on the moon, but it's going to take a pirate with a <em>wooden leg</em>, with a huge supply of cooling <em>water</em> to land on the <em>sun</em> and take that ""one small<strong> step</strong> for a man""."	Use Floatingweed5's story, except, to remember the positioning of water and sun, picture the pirate pouring water into his mouth with a wagging tongue. How refreshing while doing his<strong> step</strong> aerobics.	The peg leg pirate, wanting to get fit, signs up for some<strong> step</strong> aerobic classes. Here is is clutching his bottle of water and<strong> step</strong>ping up and down from his<strong> step</strong> platform in the island sunshine.	"This is better remembered as ""step on"" or trample. I picture a puddle of water with the sun reflected in it (to get the water above sun positioning), then you<strong> step</strong> on the puddle with your foot to trample the image."		
踪		trail	<i>Wooden leg</i> . . . <i>religion</i>. The key word refers to a <b>trail</b> of footprints or tracks left behind.		13	1382	3019	34	ショウ、 ソウ	あと	Footprint: In the pirate(=leg) religion, footprints are important because they lead to treasure.	The <strong>trail</strong> of the <em>wooden leg religion</em> was very easy to follow, since all its followers have wooden legs.	<strong>Footprint</strong>: You can actually tell a pirates <em>religion</em> by the shape of their <strong>footprint</strong>. Catholic pirates have crucifix shaped peg legs, jewish ones have david's star, and muslim ones have crescent moon and star peg legs. PS Is anyone else finding all of the supplement keywords to be really poorly chosen?	Note: If you are using the 6th edition of RTK, the keywords (person…soil…compass…taskmaster) are completely wrong! The key words are <em>leg</em>…<em>religion</em>.	The disappearance 失踪 しっそう of the pirate, leaving nothing but footprints and a <em>wooden leg</em>, inspired a strange new <em>religion</em> about Bluebeard's resurrection and ascension.		
骨		skeleton	This kanji and primitive refers to the <i>part of the body</i> composed of the bones and their joints. The top part of the kanji, terminating in the element for <i>crown</i>, is a pictograph of a bone joint. I leave it to you to put the pieces together, so to speak.		10	1383	1288	34	コツ	ほね	Your body <em>meat</em> is attached to the <em>bone joints</em> of your<strong> skeleton</strong>.	The top box 口 is the skull and the brain 田 has shriveled to the size of marble (but following kanji convention it is depicted as a square) and rolled into the bottom right hand corner. With all the hair and flesh gone the crown has slipped down to the shoulders like a necklace. 月 represents the rest of the body of the<strong> skeleton</strong>. [Idea for position of crown thanks to n1williams].	The most awesome pictograph ever: It's a guy going through an x-ray examination. The crown primitive depicts a glowing power field that goes from the top of this head down to the floor, progressively revealing his <em>skeleton</em>. Now, it's at the position of his shoulders, so everything below it is still <em>flesh</em>.	Imagine a king who died on his throne and was never removed. Since his<strong> SKELETON</strong> has no hair, ears, etc, the CROWN has slipped down past several bone JOINTS and rests amid other PARTS OF his BODY.	Imagine a<strong> skeleton</strong> wearing a <em>crown</em> and with <em>flesh</em> on just its <em>bone joints</em>. What a strange<strong> skeleton</strong>…		
滑		slippery	Water . . . skeleton.		13	1384	1289	34	カツ、コツ	すべ.る、なめ.らか	"Don't give <em>water</em> to a <em>skeleton</em>. When he drinks it, it'll sluice right through his bones, forcing you to put one of those ""Caution -<strong> Slippery</strong> Floor"" signs up on the resultant puddle."	<strong>Slippery</strong> surfaces are very dangerous for skeletons, since their bone feet slip easily… a few drops of water, and zweep! A large mess of bones to pick up and reassemble!	"Caution: Skeletons in these waters indicate someone didn't abide by the ""slippery when wet"" sign."	<em>WET SKELETONS</em> are notoriously<strong> SLIPPERY</strong>.	Most<strong> slippery</strong> when wet signs show a picture of <em>water</em> to caution you. This one goes a little far by showing a <em>skeleton</em> laying in the middle of a pool of water.		
髄		marrow	Skeleton . . . possess . . . road.		19	1385	1290	34	ズイ		A <em>skeleton</em> is shuffling along the shoulder of the road, so you pull up next to him and ask where he is going. He says he's going to donate his<strong> marrow</strong> to the hospital because he got into some financial trouble and lost everything; his<strong> marrow</strong> is the only thing he still <em>possesses</em>.	Did you know there are road ways in skeleton? Yeah, they are cool, they possess<strong> marrow</strong>.	Why didn't the <em>skeleton</em> cross the <em>road</em>? Cause he didn't have (<em>possess</em>) any guts (or<strong> marrow</strong> for that matter…) RTK2:　ズイ 脳髄 のうずい(the brains)….	Pictograph: A skeleton walking along the sidewalk trips over breaking his arm and spills his only possession over the road, his precious<strong> marrow</strong>.	A<strong> marrow</strong> transplant is needed, the <em>skeleton</em> <em>possesses</em> the<strong> marrow</strong> needed to ensure a fast <em>road</em> to recovery.

Bit of a<strong> calamity</strong> at the wedding. The bride tripped and broke her <em>jawbone</em> on the <em>altar</em>. Funniest home vids here we come.	Well, for Jawbone I think of Samson and his JAWBONE of an ass. So, Samson caused great<strong> CALAMITY</strong> at the Philistine ALTAR when he attack the priesthood with that JAWBONE of an ass.

My teeth still tingle when I think of that!	Grampa is in the old age marathon, but after a half mile on the road he is wheezing so hard he coughs up his dentures (Jawbone). Geez Grampa, don't<strong> overdo</strong> it man!

阿		Africa	"This kanji, an abbreviation for <b>Africa</b>, is now used chiefly for its sound, ""a,"" not unlike the kanji for <i>Italy</i> and the sound ""i"" that we met earlier (Frame 1245).

The <em>pinnacle</em> of racism was that of the Nazis. They made the Jews wear a <em>badge</em> on their clothes to identify them. They <strong>hindered</strong> their every movement. Moreover the peace-loving Dutch all wore the <em>badges</em> so that the Jews would be unidentifiable. Effectively <strong>hindering</strong> the Nazi plot.

Getting to the PINNACLE of mount fuji is full of<strong> hinder</strong>ances and you don't even get a BADGE at the top.

隙		chink	<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>little</i> . . . <i>sun</i> . . . <i>little</i>.

Even standing atop the highest <em>pinnacle</em>, standing above even the <em>sun</em>, the <em>little</em> man was still just as <em>little</em> as when he was under the sun.	Man those <em>little</em> <strong>chinks</strong> can do anything! They were the first to build rockets, and by launching one off the top of the highest <em>pinnacle</em> in China, one <em>little</em><strong> chink</strong> was the first to ride <em>above the sun</em>, and see all the <em>little</em><strong> chink</strong>s below!	In a wall at <em>The Pinnacle</em>, there must be a<strong> chink</strong> in the wall because I see some <em>small</em> rays of <em>sun</em>light peepin' through, up there and down there.	Daedalus, a talented craftsman, attempted to escape from his exile, where he and his son Icarus were imprisoned.

"Make sure you've got the primitives and ordering down, so as to avoid confusion with 部 <a href=""../v4/1845.html"">section</a> (#1845 部) later on."	Hint: This is a very rarely used kanji and the only relatively common word that contain it is 陪審 「ばいしん」 (meaning jury, juryman). I recommend using one of these meanings as a keyword, since you are not going to see it anywhere else unless you intend to read historic novels. [Trivia: The other meaning of this kanji is something in the spirit of subordinate. Look it up on wwwjdic if you are curious.].	"When I see<strong> auxiliary</strong> I think of the ""AUX"" input on an amplifier. Imagine a PA system being used at a protest event outside the gates of <em>The Pinnacle</em>. The protester shouts into his PA system to get the attention of the decadent residents of The Pinnacle. The guardsman of The Pinnacle silences (<em>muzzle</em>s) the protester by unplugging his microphone from the<strong> auxiliary</strong> jack of his amplifier. (Similar scene in Forrest Gump)."		
陽		sunshine	"Different from the primitive for <i>sun</i> (which figures in the character) and the kanji for <i>ray</i> (Frame 125), the key word <b>sunshine</b> is meant to convey the meaning of the masculine principle in nature, or ""Yang."" (The dark is viewed mythically as the feminine principle; see frame 1718.) From there it comes to mean <i>sun</i> also. The elements are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>piggy bank</i>."		12	1397	1300	35	ヨウ	ひ	A kid is perched on a <em>pinnacle</em> with his <em>piggy bank</em>.

So here we have a tour bus arriving at the <em>acropolis</em>: Everyone <strong>descends</strong> from the bus, stretches their <em>walking legs</em> and puts on their <em>monocles</em>. (EDIT: fixed up primitives).	A Yakuza member<strong> descend</strong>ing down from the <em>pinnacle</em> with limping <em>walking legs</em> and a lens from his <em>sunglasses</em> missing. He tried to break into the resort but the security threw him out.		
階		story	The <b>story</b> of this character refers to floors in a building. The elements: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>all</i>.		12	1406	1309	35	カイ	きざはし	<em>All</em> buildings of <em>The Pinnacle</em> are multi-<strong>storey</strong>. They don't have much room, so they have to build up. It sucks when someone presses <em>all</em> the buttons on the elevator! You have to stop at each <strong>storey</strong>!	Some stupid kid has pushed <em>all</em> the buttons in the elevator. As it stops at <em>all</em><strong> storey</strong>s you reach a <em>pinnacle</em> of impatience. Finally you reach your<strong> storey</strong>, the last one, at the <em>pinnacle</em> of the building.	The <em>pinnacle</em> of a building is the sum of <em>all</em> the<strong> storey</strong>s.	The second<strong> storey</strong> of the acropolis is the Laundrymopolis, where the elite Greeks meet to compare the whiteness of their sheets.	You're taking the elevator up to the <em>pinnacle</em>, and someone presses <em>all</em> the buttons, making <em>everyone</em> wait while it stops at every<strong> storey</strong> (thanks dingomick).		
陛		highness	This key word indicates a title of address to royalty. Its elements: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>compare</i> . . . <i>ground</i>.		10	1407	1310	35	ヘイ		Your<strong> highness</strong> is the <em>pinnacle</em> of finesse <em>compared</em> to all of us commoners who are but like <em>dirt</em> on the <em>ground</em>.	His<strong> Highness</strong>, the main man at the Pinnacle, often compares those who live outside the city's walls to dirt.	One of the many talents of the<strong> highness</strong> of <em>The Pinnacle</em> is his astounding knowledge of <em>soils</em>. He can <em>compare</em> any two <em>soil</em> samples brought to him.	We search high (pinnacle) and low(ground), and nothing compares to your<strong> highness</strong>!	"""You're nothing but <em>dirt</em> when <em>compared</em> to me"" said His<strong> Highness</strong> of <em>The Pinnacle</em>."		
隣		neighboring	Pinnacle . . . rice . . . sunglasses.		16	1408	1311	35	リン	とな.る、となり	<em>America</em> thinks it is the <em>pinnacle</em> of the world, looking down on all<strong> neighboring</strong> countries through its mirrored, aviator <em>sunglasses</em>.	All the<strong> neighboring</strong> communities to the Pinnacle have a major problem. The kids at the Pinnacle have a habit of throwing down rice from the city walls in all directions, so people in<strong> neighboring</strong> communities are forced to wear sunglasses all the time in order to avoid getting rice in their eyes.	"Tip: <em>rice</em> + <em>sunglasses</em> : In RTK3 Heisig names this combination ""<em>shoeshine</em>"". It also appears in: <a href=""../v4/2051.html"">sympathize with</a> (#2051 憐), <a href=""../v4/2052.html"">phosphorus</a> (#2052 燐), <a href=""../v4/2053.html"">camelopard</a> (#2053 麟), <a href=""../v4/2054.html"">scaled</a> (#2054 鱗). Story: You visit the <em>Acropolis</em> and are amazed to see the guy from your<strong> neighboring</strong> house back home working there as a <em>shoeshiner</em>."	Tom Cruise (<em>American</em> with <em>sunglasses</em>) tried to get admitted to <em>The Pinnacle</em> but, with all the weird press, he was rejected and so now lives in a<strong> neighboring</strong> Scientology exclusive gated community.	<em>The Pinnacle</em>'s<strong> neighboring</strong> mount is a place where they grow rice. They wear <em>sunglasses</em> since it's the sun's glare is so strong there.		
隔		isolate	<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>human legs</i> . . . <i>spike</i>. You might want to compare the kanji for <i>dissolve</i> (Frame 1123).		13	1409	1312	35	カク	へだ.てる、へだ.たる	"<em>The Pinnacle</em>, to me, is a city that makes itself out to be perfect but is filled with dirty secrets that photographers are always trying to reveal (see <a href=""../v4/1044.html"">dissolve</a> (#1044 融) The city's councilmen have<strong> isolate</strong>d all professional photographers to make sure they don't photograph these ""dirty secrets"". (which are up to your imagination)."	The people of the <em>pinnacle</em><strong> isolate</strong> themselves, <em>dissolving</em> any outside friendships.	Sadly, since the Pinnacle is<strong> isolate</strong>d, they have no modern technology. Their only means of photography is an old camera. What's that? Forgot how old cameras work? Let me show you: Light is captured through the lens (one mouth), the photographer is in a giant hood, all you can see out of it are his human legs. He holds his flash controller(a spike) in hand.	Imagine the landscape photographer, like Ansel Adams,<strong> isolate</strong>d and alone at the pinancle taking pictures with his camera. (See zenkun's story for (FRAME 1044) dissolve).	"Do you remember the poor insect in <a href=""../v4/1044.html"">dissolve</a> (#1044 融)? Actually, it was not dissolved - it was beamed right into the <em>pinnacle</em> prison for committing the crime of disturbing a <em>photographer preparing for a snapshot</em> and now lives<strong> isolate</strong>d until the end of its three days long life… (note: 隔てる (へだてる) also means to <strong>disturb ones view</strong>)."		
隠		conceal	<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>vulture</i> . . . <i>broom</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. Compare the element sat the right to the kanji for <i>calm</i> (Frame 1230).		14	1410	1313	35	イン、オン	かく.す、かく.し、かく.れる、かか.す、よ.る	"The wheat farmer's <em>heart</em> is <a href=""../v4/1147.html"">calm</a> (#1147 穏) about the <em>eagle</em> not stealing his crops because of the <em>broom</em> scarecrow. But he still <strong>conceal</strong>s all his wheat at <em>The Pinnacle</em> in case anyone else trys to steal it."	Move the <em>broom with a vulture perched on top</em>, and you'll find the <strong>concealed</strong> entrance to the <em>heart</em> of <em>The Pinnacle</em>.	People of the <em>pinnacle</em> learned to<strong> conceal</strong> their nature with <em>calm</em> demeanors, though in their <em>hearts</em> they are <em>vultures</em> and <em>witches</em> (broom).	Kiki is back on her <em>broom</em>, she's being chased by <em>vultures</em> and she's trying to<strong> conceal</strong> herself. Her <em>heart</em> is still pounding, but instead of landing in a corn field, she decides to fly up to the pinnacle of the city.	Many treasures are <strong>concealed</strong> within the <em>acropolis</em>. Which is why it is guarded by <em>vultures perched on brooms</em>, ready to peck out your <em>heart</em> if you try to sneak in and steal them.		
堕		degenerate	Pinnacle . . . possess . . . ground.		12	1411	1314	35	ダ	お.ちる、くず.す、くず.れる	"Any attempt to <em>possess</em> the <em>pinnacle</em> will<strong> degenerate</strong> into a land (""<em>ground</em>"") war."	A<strong> degenerate</strong> doctor at <em>The Pinnacle</em> is doing illegal <strong>abortions</strong>. He's so sick he just throws the aborted fetuses onto the <em>ground</em> far below. And like a <em>possess demon</em>, he keeps some tied to his side on a belt as trophies.	<em>The Pinnacle</em> has <strong>degenerated</strong> into an group that just tries to <em>possess</em> as much <em>soil</em> as possible.	"The <em><strong>Pinnacle</strong></em> of the Roman Empire (as with many other empires since) <strong>degenerated</strong> as they just tried to <em><strong>possess</strong></em> more & more <em><strong>land</strong></em>. "" like . . . . . . duh!('<strong>ダ</strong>') "" // お.ちる / ダ duo4 타 (ta) 휴 (hyu)."	<em>The Pinnacle</em> <em>possess</em>es class and sophistication. By contrast, the land (<em>soil</em>) below is<strong> degenerate</strong>, and unrefined.		
陥		collapse	Pinnacle . . . bound up . . . olden times.		10	1412	1315	35	カン	おちい.る、おとしい.れる	<em>The Pinnacle</em> is actually <em>bound up</em> by supports from <em>olden times</em>. Eventually, they give out, and the whole thing starts to<strong> collapse</strong>.	<em>The Pinnacle</em> is supported by pilings which were <em>bound up</em> in <em>olden times</em>. One day when the bindings rot away, the whole thing will<strong> collapse</strong>. (tweaking dihutensoa's story to work a little better for me).	At the pinnacle of any society's development, being overly bound to rules from olden times leads to<strong> collapse</strong> (see Jared Diamond's<strong> Collapse</strong>).	The adventurers reached the <em>pinnacle</em>, and claimed the artefact which had been <em>bound up</em> since <em>olden times</em>: the <em>staff</em> of the <em>Sun</em> God. But as soon as they removed it, the place began to<strong> collapse</strong>! Will they make it out in time??	The<strong> collapse</strong> of the pinnacle society occurred after they were <em>bound up</em> in <em>olden times</em> beliefs and practices and thereby failed to progress.		
穴		hole	<i>House</i> . . . <i>eight</i>.	* As a primitive, this kanji uses an alternate form: the primitive for <i>eight</i> is replaced with that for <i>human legs</i>.	5	1413	1316	35	ケツ	あな	"A black<strong> hole</strong> is a ""House of Infinity"". Infinity is of course represented by a sideways ""8"", but here we have a Japanese ""8"" instead."	Billiards anyone? <em>House</em> rules here state that the first person to pot the <em>eight</em> ball into the <strong>hole</strong> wins the game.	What good is it to buy a house with 8<strong> hole</strong>s in the ceiling? (The kanji for 8 also looks like water flowing from the ceiling.).	"I think of people playing on a mini golf course. One player is frustrated because the ball got stuck into a <em>house</em> (a small building decoration), and ends up doing a ""hole-in-<em>eight</em>"" instead of a<strong> hole</strong>-in-one."	I came home one day to find that termites had <em>eight</em> my entire <em>house</em>… nothing but a<strong> hole</strong> left.		
空		empty	Hole . . . craft.		8	1414	1317	35	クウ	そら、あ.く、あ.き、あ.ける、から、す.く、す.かす、むな.しい	The <em>craft</em> of creating a <em>black hole</em> is in creating an <strong>emptiness</strong> which can attract things.	Hole-craft is the way of making<strong> empty</strong> spaces, like the sky.	The <em>craft</em> of making donut <em>holes</em>…..the middle of the donut is <em>empty</em>.	<em>Hole-craft</em> is the <em>craft</em> of making <em>holes</em> that are filled with <strong>emptiness</strong> or vacuum ( 真空 (しんくう): vacuum). Normal holes appear to be<strong> empty</strong>, but are actually filled with air ( 空気 (くうき): air). 空港 (くうこう): airport 航空機 (こうくうき): aircraft 空 (そら): sky 空 (から):<strong> empty</strong> 空手 (からて): karate.	HoleCraft, the new game from Blizzard, involves running around taking various items out of holes in the ground and bringing them back to your home base. The person with the most items after all the holes are<strong> empty</strong> wins. I'm already camping the game store for this release, can't wait. Been practicing by digging holes in my backyard, throwing various things in them and<strong> empty</strong>ing them as fast as I can.		
控		withdraw	Fingers . . . empty.		11	1415	1318	35	コウ	ひか.える、ひか.え	With my <em>fingers</em>, I punch in my bank code and<strong> withdraw</strong> some money from my account. And now it's <em>empty</em> again, as usual!	"If you find yourself in a fight with a karate master with no weapons or martial art skills, just your <em>empty fingers</em>, you should<strong> withdraw</strong> because 空手 (karate=""empty hand"") is more powerful than 控 (=""empty fingers"")."	<strong>WITHDRAW</strong> your FINGERS from the cookie jar if it is already EMPTY.	As in Aesop's fable: the monkey puts its hand in a jar to get a piece of fruit, but now it can't pull its hand out. It will have to empty its fingers before it can<strong> withdraw</strong> its hand.	"This is a bit of an odd keyword choice from Heisig. ""<strong>Withhold</strong>"" would work a lot better considering how this kanji is used. As in restrain/hold yourself back ( 控える ) or withhold/deduct taxes ( 控除 ) or withholding a spare/reserve copy ( 控え )."		
突		stab	Hole . . . St. Bernard dog.		8	1416	1319	35	トツ、カ	つ.く	When you<strong> stab</strong> something you often leave a big hole.	The police have recruited a special breed of <em>St. Bernard</em> that can lick the wounds of a<strong> stab</strong>bing victim. The bleeding will stop instantly, saving the victim's life. One quirky side-effect, however, is that this treatment leaves behind a rather large hole…	I<strong> stab</strong> your annoying <em>St. Bernard</em> and stare in shock at the giant black <em>hole</em> it leaves instead of a wound.	There's a hole in that Saint Bernard – somebody<strong> stab</strong>bed it.	A big<strong> stab</strong> leaves a <em>big hole</em>.		
究		research	Hole . . . baseball.		7	1417	1320	35	キュウ、ク	きわ.める	Most<strong> research</strong> scientists have 9 holes…..two nostrils, two ears, a mouth, and four eyes…… :-).	Scientiest are<strong> research</strong>ing , and have already found <em>nine</em> black <em>holes</em> !	The manager is doing<strong> research</strong> to find the <em>holes</em> in the opposing <em>baseball team</em>'s strategy.	When I saw this kanji I had the instant image of scientists throwing a <em>baseball</em> through a <em>hole</em> and noting the 'results'. I found that quite hilarious, but well, maybe it's just me.	<strong>Research</strong> has shown that <em>9 holes</em> of golf can help alleviate stress.		
窒		plug up	Hole . . . climax.		11	1418	1321	35	チツ		Sticking a<strong> plug up</strong> your hole will lead to stronger climaxes.	I'm pretty sure Heisig wrote the whole book just so he could make this joke.	Here we have a Hole and Climax to mean<strong> PLUG UP</strong>. This is so butt-f**king easy, pun intended. If you<strong> PLUG UP</strong> her Hole, she will Climax.	I just think its hilarious how many stories are getting reported for this character. Come on!! what else could it be! How better to remember it ? Prudes please get over yourselves. If someone has a good story, just because you are easily offended, doesn't mean someone else( the majority ) won't find it useful. planning to be missionaries in Japan with all your Kanji skillz ? If you find this offensive…hahahaha. You will get a shock when you see your first KONBINI magazine shelf.LMAO..i gotsreported.	My girlfriend <strong>plugs up</strong> her <strong>ちつ</strong>(vagina 膣) <em>hole</em> to <em>climax</em>! This Kanji's on-yomi is pronounced '<strong>ちつ</strong>' (チツ) // zhi4 질 (jil) 절 (jeol).		
窃		stealth	Hole . . . cut.		9	1419	1322	35	セツ	ぬす.む、ひそ.か	"This more commonly means ""steal"", like how a thief <em>cuts</em> a <em>hole</em> to steal the jewels."	The word<strong> STEALTH</strong> makes me instantly think of Solid Snake, who CUTS a HOLE in a cardboard box so he can peer out of it.	<strong>Stealth</strong> bombers <em>cut holes</em> through the enemy radar.	I picture a<strong> stealth</strong>y thief cutting a round hole in the glass window to quietly unlock it.	The new<strong> stealth</strong> bomber being developed by the US government is insane. Instead of flying under radar or disrupting it, it simply bypasses the whole thing. It <em>cuts</em> a <em>black hole</em> just above it with its nose, then disappears into it. Then it travels invisibly and instantly to its destination, then <em>cuts</em> another <em>black hole</em> into the sky and reappears. Only trouble is that they have to make sure not to enter or exit somewhere important - or they'll suck the whole place into the <em>black hole</em>.		
窟		cavern	Hole . . . yield.		13	1420	2615	35	クツ、コツ	いわや、いはや、あな	After Osama blew a <em>hole</em> in NY, the counterreaction forced him to <em>yield</em> and retreat into <strong>caverns</strong>.	"In ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the Milennium Falcon flies into a large <em>hole</em>, of what they think is a<strong> cavern</strong>, because they don't want to <em>yield</em> to the forces of the Empire. Turns out it's not a<strong> cavern</strong> at all, actually…"	The entrance to the<strong> cavern</strong> tavern is little more than a <em>hole</em> in the wall, but inside the place is such a maze of<strong> cavern</strong>s that they have to stick a <em>flag</em> over the <em>exit</em> or you'd never find your way out.	It seemed to be just a <em>hole</em>, but it did <em>yield</em> a wondrous<strong> cavern</strong> of stalactites and stalagmites.	Remember when they found Saddam Hussein in a hole and he finally yielded and exited holding a white flag? Wish they'd have found Osama in his<strong> cavern</strong> instead..		
窪		depression	<i>Hole</i> . . . <i>water</i> . . . <i>ivy</i>. The <b>depression</b> referred to here is a sunken place in the ground, rather than in one's spirits.		14	1421	1323	35	ワ、ア	くぼ.む、くぼ.み、くぼ.まる、くぼ	A<strong> depression</strong> is a hole in the ground. Water naturally collects there which provides moisture for vines to grow.	The<strong> depression</strong> in the ground become a trap: the <em>hole</em> was filled with <em>water</em> and covered with <em>ivy</em>.	The meaning of this character is an indentation in the ground, not emotional<strong> depression</strong>. It's best to avoid using the latter in your story because it will give you the wrong meaning (keep in mind the eventual goal is to read kanji and understand the actual meaning of them). This particular<strong> depression</strong> is a <em>hole</em> in the ground that collects water, and ivy is growing out of it.	(<strong>WARNING</strong>: Sexual content) Being the dirty girl that she is, I came upon <em>Paris Hilton</em> having sex in a<strong> depression</strong>, or <em>hole</em>, in the ground. At this point, however, she and her unfortunately partner were tangled up in some <em>ivy</em> and couldn't get out. So I filled it with <em>water</em> and watched them both drown.	This kanji reminds me of video games. There's a big <em>sink hole</em> in the ground that is now filled with <em>water</em> that you can swim in and <em>vines</em> growing all around that you can climb on.		
搾		squeeze	Fingers . . . hole . . . saw.		13	1422	1324	35	サク	しぼ.る	You have trouble squeezing your hand through the hole so you use a saw to enlarge it.	(Thanks DrJones) You<strong> squeeze</strong> the teats of the cow with your <em>fingers</em> but it's your first try and you don't have any milk come through the <em>holes</em>, so you take a <em>saw</em> and cut the teats to make bigger <em>holes</em>. Poor cow, this story<strong> squeeze</strong>s my heart.	Very simple visual image makes this an easy kanji to remember. Just picture that you<strong> SQUEEZE</strong> your FINGERS going through the HOLE in the handle of the SAW. You then<strong> SQUEEZE</strong> your FINGERS tight to use the SAW to cut a HOLE.	"To<strong> squeeze</strong> is to hold something <a href=""../v4/2614.html"">tight</a> (#2614 窄) in your <em>fingers</em>."	Oh no! You cut a <em>hole</em> in your <em>finger</em> with a <em>saw</em>!<strong> Squeeze</strong> your <em>finger</em> to stop the bleeding!!		
窯		kiln	Hole . . . sheep . . . oven fire.		15	1423	1325	35	ヨウ	かま	Be sure to put a <em>hole</em> in that ceramic <em>sheep</em> before you put it over the <em>fire</em>. Otherwise, it'll just explode in the<strong> kiln</strong>. (If you've never done ceramics before, it's important that the object have a hole in it, or this really will happen.).	You put the sheep in the hole of the<strong> kiln</strong> and turn on the flames.	True story: when I was a kid if there were lambs born in the winter we'd put them in a cardboard box and put them in the oven (on low!) to keep them warm. I guess this only really helps me out hehehe…	Oh Boy! A craft project indeed! Thru the <em>hole</em> in the top of the <strong>kiln</strong>, put in the <em>sheep</em> you sculpted from clay. Turn on the <em>fire</em> underneath and voila!	"I kept forgetting the <em>sheep</em> in smithsonian's story, so just imagine the sound effects: ""Baaa…"" (bleating)/Baaam! (explosion)."		
窮		hard up	Hole . . . somebody . . . bow.		15	1424	1326	35	キュウ、キョウ	きわ.める、きわ.まる、きわ.まり、きわ.み	<strong>Hard up</strong> = nothing but your body, living in a hole, with just a bow to hunt for your food.	<strong>Somebody</strong> so <strong>hard up</strong> for cash, the volunteered to explore a <em>black hole</em> with nothing but a <em>bow</em>.	Ok, picture a HOLE (well, more a pit trap) that SOMEBODY (well, a hunter with a BOW) just fell in. He's dangling over the HOLE holding onto his BOW across it. SOMEBODY finds it's HARD to get UP out of the HOLE. That great visual image should grant mastery of this kanji.	"With the research to plug up a <em>black hole</em> going nowhere and funding slashed, (see <a href=""../v4/1320.html"">research</a> (#1320 究)), the team can not afford to launch any more probes due to the high cost of the fuel. <em>Somebody</em>, probably one of the<strong> hard up</strong> scientists desperately in need of more funding, tries using a <em>bow</em> to shoot a probe into the centre of the <em>block hole</em> – and funnily enough it succeeds!"	A girl is so<strong> hard up</strong> for cash she lets <em>somebody</em> use her <em>hole</em> with a <em>bow</em>, it's a fetish-thing I guess; makes the guy hard and up.		
探		grope	Fingers . . . paper punch . . . tree.		11	1425	1327	35	タン	さぐ.る、さが.す	A pictograph of a japanese schoolgirl getting<strong> grope</strong>d by perverts on the train. The <em>fingers</em> of course, a <em>crown</em> (her too short skirt) and her <em>legs</em> below (which to be honest are pretty thick like <em>tree</em> trunks).	"Note: ""<em>crown+human legs</em>"" appears 7 times in RTK. In 4 cases (nos. 323, 1327, 1328, 2920) <em>crown</em> is above <em>human legs</em>, and in the other 3 (1888, 2472, 2679) one leg passes through the crown. I call the 1st pattern ""<em>Miss World</em>"" (who is wearing a <em>crown</em> & has long <em>human legs</em>) and the 2nd ""<em>garter</em>"" (one <em>human leg</em> passes through the <em>crown</em> wearing it as a <em>garter</em>). Story: <em>Miss World</em> has climbed a <em>tree</em> to avoid the <em>finger</em> that was <strong>groping</strong> for her. ( 探 means ""grope for"", i.e. search)."	(based on gorgon's story) a pictograph of a japanese schoolgirl getting<strong> grope</strong>d by perverts on the train. The <em>fingers</em> of course, a <em>crown</em> (her too short skirt) and her <em>legs</em> below. It's her own fault for wearing such a short skirt and causing the perverts to get <em>wood</em>!	I don't know why, but this is a pictograph of someone groping about in the dark (with his fingers, obviously) for his beloved wooden paper punch.	"As esaulgd said, this kanji DOES NOT mean ""touch"" like <a href=""midori://search?text=%E8%A7%A6%E3%82%8B%E3%80%82"">触る。</a> Here is my story: Imagine a blind detective who must<strong> GROPE</strong> for answers in by reading old police reports. But because he is blind, he must use brail books, you know, the ones that have been PAPER PUNCHED on PAPER (wood). Naturally, he uses his FINGERS for this."		
深		deep	Water . . . paper punch . . . tree.		11	1426	1328	35	シン	ふか.い、-ぶか.い、ふか.まる、ふか.める、み-	"If the groper's <em>""tree""</em> goes up the girl's <em>miniskirt</em> too<strong> deep</strong>, he'll ejaculate <em>fluid</em>. (Sorry it's kinda coarse but it works.)."	Thrown in<strong> deep</strong> water, the Japanese School girl tries to reach a floating tree to save herself.	Made a hole with a paper punch in a tree, so<strong> deep</strong> that water started flowing out.	"<em>Miss World</em> (see Katsuo's note on <a href=""../v4/1327.html"">grope</a> (#1327 探)) is now hiding on a <em>tree</em> because now she is afraid of the<strong> deep</strong> <em>water</em> below."	The gardner finds <em>liquid</em> oozing from a<strong> deep</strong> <em>paper punched</em> hole in the <em>tree</em>.		
丘		hill	Since this supposedly pictographic representation of a hill looks like anything but, picture a row of <i>axes</i> driven into the ground up to their heads, and see if that doesn't present a more memorable image of <b>hill</b> - at least a riskier one sliding down!		5	1427	1329	35	キュウ	おか	Excalibur is the sword planted in a rock. Lesser known AXCAHILLBUR is the <em>axe</em> planted on top of a<strong> hill</strong>.	At Capitol<strong> Hill</strong> proposals get <em>axe</em>d on the <em>floor</em>.	This is Faeries<strong> Hill</strong> (the kingdom of faeries is said to live under the<strong> hill</strong>s, as in english myths) where a lumberjack mysteriously disappeared. At the top of the<strong> hill</strong> is an <em>axe</em> planted in the <em>floor</em>, left there by the faeries as a warning to anyone else who would be fool enough to go up the<strong> hill</strong> to gather wood.	I climbed to the top of a<strong> hill</strong> but didn't have a flag so I stuck my <em>axe</em> in the <em>ground</em> in order to mark my momentous ascent.	I like to c-<strong>hill</strong>-<em>ax</em> on the <em>floor</em>.		
岳		Point	Think of the key word as referring to proper names of mountains, but do not confuse with <i>mountain pass</i> (Frame 835). The elements are: <i>hill</i> . . . <i>mountain</i>.		8	1428	1330	35	ガク	たけ	A<strong> point</strong> is a extra little <em>hill</em> at the top of a <em>mountain</em>. We'll call it 'Fireman's<strong> Point</strong>'.	This actually means a high mountain. So, to cater to the keyword, it's surely obvious (ahem) that if something gets such a fine title as<strong> Point</strong>, it must be more magnificent than the average mountain. It's as if there was a hill on top of an average mountain, adding to its height.	"There's a movie called ""The Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain"". The story is that English cartographer says that the mountain near a Welsh village is actually a hill (too low for a mountain), but the locals decide to make it a mountain (by making it higher). Let's say that in the end the <em>hill</em> got the title<strong> Point</strong> to mark it as a <em>mountain</em>."	I chopped off the<strong> point</strong> of the <em>mountain</em> with my <em>axe</em>. Now it is just a hill.	At some<strong> point</strong>, a <em>hill</em> becomes a <em>mountain</em>.		
兵		soldier	Hill . . . animal legs.		7	1429	1331	35	ヘイ、ヒョウ	つわもの	Listen up<strong> soldier</strong>s! We're going to take that <em>hill</em>. You are no longer men with human legs. You are voracious animals, with <em>animal legs</em>! Got it? <em>Animal legs</em>! Now take that hill!	The <em>hill</em> is so steep that you almost have to have <em>animal legs</em> to walk on it. However, the <strong>soldiers</strong> have no problem because they've been trained to march there.	"Army ant <strong>soldiers</strong> climb up a <em>hill</em> with their mighty <em>animal</em> ""insect"" <em>legs</em> to battle the grasshoppers."	<strong>Soldier</strong>s specially designed for combat in the <strong>hill</strong>s have got their lower body replaced by that of a mountain goat.

糸		thread	Remember when your granny used to ask you to bend your arms at the <i>elbows</i> and hold them out so that she could use them like a rack to hold a skein of string or yarn (here <b>thread</b>) while she rolled it up into a <i>little</i> ball?

He's a very memorable character, and don't forget that he can shoot strings from both arms. What happens to the relative primitive when Spiderman comes along? If you can clearly picture his<strong> thread</strong>s winding, pulling, yanking, sticking to, filling, tying, and strangling objects, then you'll never confuse this primitive with another one.	Hate to be pedantic, but it's spelt <em>Spider-man</em>, not <em>Spiderman</em>. Stan Lee added the hyphen to differentiate him from <em>Superman</em>..		
織		weave	Thread . . . kazoo.		18	1432	1334	36	ショク、シキ	お.る、お.り、おり、-おり、-お.り	Spiderman<strong> weave</strong>s his way through the skyline while listening to his theme song on his ipod. It is played, of course, by kazoos.	Play the kazoo magically and the thread will<strong> weave</strong> itself.	<em>Spiderman</em>'s housemate insists on playing the <em>kazoo</em> every night, despite <em>Spiderman</em>'s protests. Eventually, <em>Spiderman</em> can't bear it anymore and<strong> weave</strong>s a tight web around his housemate's face to prevent him from playing the <em>kazoo</em>. 織布 (しょくふ): woven cloth, fabric 織物 (おりもの): fabric, textile.	When spider-man<strong> weave</strong>s threads, they sound like kazoos when they shoot out his arms. When you imagine it, it's quite funny.	<em>Spiderman</em><strong> weave</strong>s his <em>threads</em> using a <em>kazoo</em> as a shuttle.		
繕		darning	Thread . . . virtuous.		18	1433	1335	36	ゼン	つくろ.う	After a day being <em>virtuouos</em> and keeping the city safe, <em>Spiderman</em>'s outfit is in need of some repair. Luckily, as he can shoot out threads<strong> darning</strong> is very easy for him to do.	<strong>Darning</strong> is too obscure a word for me, I prefer to just think of it as repair. And obviously, repairing someones broken cloth things is a virtuous thing to do, and you need thread to do it.	<em>Spiderman</em> is of course <em>virtuous</em> and spends a lot of time<strong> darning</strong> his costume after battles so that his privates don't show.	"<strong>Darning</strong> socks instead of buying new ones shows the virtousness of the person - it exhibits the Japanese virtue of thrift (the Meiji emperor would refuse to buy new boots, constantly having them repaired. The Showa emperor would refuse to buy books he wanted because he ""couldn't afford them."")."	The <em>thread</em> is too <em>virtuous</em> for damning; it can only be used for<strong> darning</strong>.		
縮		shrink	Thread . . . inn.		17	1434	1336	36	シュク	ちぢ.む、ちぢ.まる、ちぢ.める、ちぢ.れる、ちぢ.らす	After spending the night at an <em>inn</em>, <em>spider man</em> discovered to his dismay that his costume had <strong>shrunk</strong> in the wash, and no longer fit!	Don't let the <strong>Inn</strong> wash your <strong>thread</strong>s, they will<strong> shrink</strong> them!	"<em>Spiderman</em> spends the night at a traditional Japanese <a href=""../v4/995.html"">inn</a> (#995 宿), to spend time with his friend <em>Mr T</em> snorting <em>cocaine under the ceiling</em>. Alas, that's not <em>cocaine</em>, it's one of those magic mushrooms from Alice in Wonderland. <em>Spiderman</em> and <em>Mr T</em> start to<strong> shrink</strong>."	To fit 100 people in one house you have to<strong> shrink</strong> until you're as thin as threads.	After spending the night at a cheap inn, spider man discovered to his dismay that his costume has been shrunk in the wash, and no longer fits! Perhaps now here will stop getting cheap Inn cleaning service. ;).		
繁		luxuriant	Cleverness . . . thread.		16	1435	1337	36	ハン	しげ.る、しげ.く	Important:<strong> Luxuriant</strong> does NOT mean luxurious, as the other stories indicate. Definition: abundant or lush in growth, as vegetation. When <em>Venom</em> realized he couldn't beat <em>Spider-Man</em> in a fair fight, he showed his <em>cleverness</em> by spraying venom all over Spider-Man's<strong> luxuriant</strong> garden.	<em>Venom</em> is covered in a<strong> luxuriant</strong> and surprisingly <em>clever</em> symbiotic suit, but it's also the <em>taskmaster</em> for his <em>every</em> evil act.	<em>Every taskmaster's threads</em> are<strong> luxuriant</strong>, made with only the best fabrics in all the brightest colours.	This kanji is 1337 ^^.	Key word is <em>luxuriant</em> (abundant or lush in growth, as vegetation; teeming). <em>Venom</em> uses his <em>cleverness</em> to create a<strong> luxuriant</strong> garden, teeming with<strong> luxuriant</strong> vegetation, in a bid to lure Mary Jane into his clutches. (Thanks esaulgd.).		
縦		vertical	Thread . . . accompany.		16	1436	1338	36	ジュウ	たて	When <em>Spider-man</em> does his amazing<strong> vertical</strong> wall climbing, a throng of photographers <em>accompanies</em> him to get a good shot of the action.	You may only <em>accompany</em> <em>spiderman</em> if you're able to climb buildings<strong> vertical</strong>ly.	True<strong> vertical</strong> can be found by hanging a plumb line - a thread accompanied by a weight.	When <em>Spider-Man</em> goes<strong> vertical</strong>, it's very hard to <em>accompany</em> him.	When you are facing a<strong> vertical</strong> climb, it is best to be <em>accompanied</em> by some good, strong <em>thread</em>.		
緻		fine	The key word should be taken to mean minute, detailed, or nuanced. Its primitive elements are: <i>thread</i> . . . <i>doth</i>.		16	1437	3020	36	チ	こまか.い	This kanji shows <em>Spiderman</em> giving a dress of the <strong>finest</strong> thread to his girlfriend. Of course, the real purpose of the gift is to get his girlfriend to <em>doth</em> him.	<strong>fine</strong>: If the <em>thread</em> <em>doth</em> fit through the eye of the needle, it is <strong>fine</strong> <em>thread</em> indeed.	"<strong>Fine</strong>. The new Goth <em>Spiderman doth</em> wear a costume made from black spider silk of the <strong>fine</strong>st weave. <a href=""midori://search?text=%E7%B7%BB%E5%AF%86%E3%83%BB%E3%81%A1%E3%81%BF%E3%81%A4"">緻密・ちみつ</a> close, minute, elaborate, intricate."	"When <em>Spiderman</em> does (<a href=""../v4/756.html"">doth</a> (#756 致)) <em>climax</em> he ejects only the <strong>fine</strong>st <em>thread</em> because his <em>taskmaster</em> (taskmistress) told him so."	<em>Spiderman doth climax</em> whenever the <strong>fine</strong> <em>dominatrix</em> Mary Jane tells him to.		
線		line	Thread . . . spring.		15	1438	1339	36	セン	すじ	This kanji is used for train <strong>lines</strong>. <em>Spiderman</em> does a hot <em>spring</em> tour of Japan using the train <strong>lines</strong>. You can see the Spidey costume hanging on the washing <strong>line</strong> as he enjoys the onsen.	Japan's train<strong> line</strong>s are like threads that spring from Tokyo station.	Spiderman casts a<strong> line</strong> in order to get across a very hot srping.	<em>Spiderman</em> usually just travels by web, but when he goes to visit the hot <em>spring</em>, he has to take several train<strong> line</strong>s instead, since there are no buildings to swing from. [He tried swinging from power<strong> line</strong>s once–big mistake].	On a vacation in Japan, SPIDER MAN waits in<strong> LINE</strong> to get in the hot SPRING.		
綻		come apart at the seams	Thread . . . determine.		14	1439	2670	36	タン	ほころ.びる	Even though his costume is <strong>coming apart at the seams</strong> as he chases the bad guys, <em>Spiderman</em> is still <em>determined</em> to catch them.	"<em>Spiderman</em> is so <em>determined</em> to catch criminals that he doesn't notice his costume is <strong>coming apart at the seams</strong>. The Daily Bugle will love this! ""Spider-pervert terrorizes city!""."	The quality of the <em>thread</em> will <em>determine</em> whether your clothing will <strong>come apart at the seams</strong>.	<em>Spiderman</em>'s costume has<strong> come apart at the seams</strong> and here he is, <em>mending</em> it in his <em>house</em>, <em>determined</em> to make it stronger than before.	"If you want a simpler keyword, ""rip"" works just fine as a replacement."		
締		tighten	Thread . . . sovereign.		15	1440	1340	36	テイ	し.まる、し.まり、し.める、-し.め、-じ.め	(astridtops) Spiderman managed to get behind the sovereign. (pick your favourite nowadays country ruler who isn't doing a good job). Spidey has<strong> tighten</strong>d a web around the sovereing's throat. As long as the sovereign says what spidey whispers, he will be fine. Sovereign yelping : ' we will draw are troops back! and we will spend more money on healthcare, schools and less on wars!' Spidey whispering: ' If you continue at this pace, you might be doing good things AND the people will like you.'.	The <em>sovereign</em> appears to be ruling, but in reality someone behind him (for instance his wife) has a <em>thread</em> around his throat, and if he dares to make a decision she doesn't like, she starts pulling the <em>thread</em> and<strong> tighten</strong>s it around his throat.	<em>The Sovereign</em> (a crazy comic book villain) has been caught by <em>Spiderman.</em> He's trying to get free so <em>Spiderman</em><strong> tighten</strong>s the web around him.	"<em>Spiderman</em><strong> tighten</strong>s a web around <em>Caesar</em>'s throat.. ""Et tu, Spiderman?""."	"The <em>sovereign</em> uses his <em>threads</em> of influence (""pulling the strings"") to<strong> tighten</strong> his grip on power."		
維		fiber	Thread . . . turkey.		14	1441	1341	36	イ		Hey, <em>Spidey</em>! Eat that <em>turkey</em> if you want, but make sure you eat some<strong> fiber</strong>s: you want spidey <em>threads</em>, don't ya?	If you want to increase your<strong> fiber</strong> intake, just leave on those <em>threads</em> that are used to sew up the stuffed <em>turkey</em> and eat them too.	"Feeling mischievous while shopping, Spiderman throws his web into the cavity of a <em>turkey</em>. He chuckles, ""That ought to raise the <em>turkey</em>'s<strong> FIBER</strong> content.""."	When <em>Spider-Man</em> first made his suit, he was so fixated on the textile aspect, on making sure all of the <strong>fibres</strong> were sturdy, he didn't realize till he finished that he'd made it with a <em>turkey</em> design on the chest instead of a spider. He felt like a real <em>turkey</em> then (that's the sort of campy insult he might use).	<em>Spiderman</em> needs more <strong>fibre</strong> so he eats <em>turkey</em> sandwiches on wholewheat bread.		
羅		gauze	Eye . . . fiber.		19	1442	1342	36	ラ	うすもの	Lots of girls in Japan wear<strong> gauze</strong> patches over one <em>eye</em> made of course white <em>fibers</em>. They think it is cute, and I must admit, I have come to think so too.	"Rocky won the match but left with a nasty <em>eye</em> injury, and needs some<strong> gauze</strong> for it. I use a modified version of the Rocky theme song to remember this one – ""the <em>eye</em> and the <em>fiber</em>""."	The <em>eyes</em> on Spiderman's mask are made of carbon <em>fibre</em><strong> gauze</strong>. Light, strong and see-through.	<strong>Gauze</strong> is a <em>net</em> of <em>fiber</em>.	"This is also used to mean ""web"" (e.g. in 網羅 ) and ""ordered"" (e.g. in 羅列 ). The web meaning is the basic one, and a web consists of fibers and the ""eyes"" (holes, 網の目 ; like ""eye"" of a needle) between them.<strong> Gauze</strong> is just a form of web. ""Ordered"" comes from the order inherent in the matrix formed by the holes. Think of ghastly eyes peeking at you from between the fibers (and fabric of space?) when you're not looking, and you won't look webs the same way ever again."		
練		practice	Thread . . . east.		14	1443	1343	36	レン	ね.る、ね.り	Spidey stays on the east side of the city to<strong> practice</strong>. The West Side is too dangerous.	[+ skinnyneo] <em>Spiderman</em> visits the <em>East</em> to<strong> practice</strong> his swinging skills. All those Asian cities with skyscrapers and low crime rates make it easy for him to<strong> practice</strong>.	You<strong> practice</strong> your Japanese skills in a discussion <em>thread</em> with lots of people from the Far <em>East</em> (since many of the people who are interested in studying Japanese are Asian).	After being defeated one too many times, Spiderman heads East to the Orient in order to<strong> practice</strong> various martial arts.	PRACTICING Japanese every day is the THREAD that binds me to the EAST.		
緒		thong	<i>Thread</i> . . . <i>puppet</i>. Although we usually think of a <b>thong</b> as coming at the end of a piece of string, this character's meaning allows for it to come at the beginning as well.		14	1444	1344	36	ショ、チョ	お、いとぐち	<em>Spiderman</em> has a secret fetish, he likes nothing better than to dress his <em>lovedoll</em> in a<strong> thong</strong>. Wierd, eh!	A<strong> thong</strong> is no more than a <em>thread</em> used by <em>someone</em> as underwear!	"Instead of puppet I like to think of ""someone"" as ninja (since it is the second kanji in ninja). A <strong>ninja</strong> must be able to steal a <strong>thread</strong> from a woman's<strong> thong</strong> without her noticing."	<em>Spidey</em> and a <em>Ninja</em> fight over a sexy<strong> thong</strong> they found, but then they realize that together ( 一緒 ) they could easily get another… ショ 一緒 いっしょ(together) チヨ 情緒 じょうちょ(heartstrings)….	Spiderman's girlfriend throws a<strong> thong</strong> she found in his bed at him. And who's is this then she asks, and Spiderman replies, uhh… someone's?		
続		continue	Thread . . . sell.		13	1445	1345	36	ゾク、ショク、コウ、キョウ	つづ.く、つづ.ける、つぐ.ない	Even though Peter Parker has become <em>Spiderman</em>, he<strong> continue</strong>s to sell pictures that he takes as a photographer.	"Here's how Spiderman comics sell: At the end of the comic they leave with with a cliffhanger and say ""to be<strong> continue</strong>d"". In fact, the japanese verb 続く is used in comics and tv shows to mean ""to be<strong> continue</strong>d"". They have adapted the model created by Spiderman to hook the readers so that they can sell more comics."	Spiderman's comics<strong> continue</strong> to sell after several decades. (Even the goofy samurai with his log-crown toys is selling spiderman).	Your thread had better sell if you want to<strong> continue</strong> to be a weaver!	If you attach <em>strings</em> to the things you <em>sell</em>, you will be able to<strong> continue</strong> making profit from them even after the fact.		
絵		picture	Thread . . . meeting.		12	1446	1346	36	カイ、エ		There's never a<strong> picture</strong> of Spiderman meeting Peter Parker… I wonder why?	"Peter Parker's editor tells him ""Next time you have a <em>meeting</em> with <em>spiderman</em> take a goddamn<strong> picture</strong>, you're a photographer after all""."	A<strong> picture</strong> is just a matter of the harmonious <em>meeting</em> of lines. The many <em>threads</em> of a brush <em>meet</em> together on paper, finally forming a <strong>painting</strong>.	By coercing fine, colorful <em>threads</em> to <em>meet</em> other threads in a needlepoint, it's entirely possible to create a very nice<strong> picture</strong>.	"A word of <strong>caution</strong>: This kanji's on-yomi is ""え”, and it's meaning is that of a <strong>picture</strong>, painting, drawing… However, it's not, strictly speaking, a photograph. The kanji for photograph is 写真 （しゃしん）「keyword 1: copy, 2: truth」. Try to remember this kanji without using the image of a photograph, to distinguish them further. The top two stories right now (by PacifistGod and joesan) sort of make you think of a photograph, so bear this in mind!"		
統		overall	Thread . . . allot.		12	1447	1347	36	トウ	す.べる、ほび.る	<em>Spidey</em> is <em>alloted</em> the biggest crime fighter jurisdiction in NYC because his<strong> OVERALL</strong> arrest record is the best.	According to Greek mythology, there's a <em>thread</em> <em>alloted</em> to everyone, and its length is the<strong> overall</strong> determinant of your fate.	SPIDERMAN was originally ALLOTTED some<strong> overall</strong>s by the Superheroes' Guild, but he rejected them in favor of his current outfit.	<strong>Overall</strong> I allot the Spiderman movies an average rating. Spiderman - Great, Spiderman 2 - Average, Spiderman 3 - ass.<strong> Overall</strong> they are average.	"[smithsonian(I have to nitpick your story, sorry)] According to Norse mythology, there's a <em>thread</em> <em>alloted</em> to everyone, and its length is the<strong> overall</strong> determinant of your fate. Info: The belief is that the 3 Norns (Goddesses) of the past, the present and the future, weave the thread of fate beneath Yggdrasil (the world tree) for every person, the pattern that results is the ""fabric"" of reality."		
絞		strangle	Thread . . . mingle.		12	1448	1348	36	コウ	しぼ.る、し.める、し.まる	Spiderman hates going to parties and having to mingle. He wants to<strong> strangle</strong> someone after just a little small talk.	Darth Vader, who was mingling among the crowd with his hat, is spotted by Spiderman. Spiderman jumps at him to teach the villain for coming to New York. Darth Vader catches him in mid air and<strong> strangle</strong>s him with the force…	<em>Spiderman</em>came out of nowhere and started to<strong> strangle</strong> me, when I was right in the middle of <em>mingling</em> with this cute girl named Mary Jane.	At the elegant cocktail party of VIP's, the spy, dressed like everyone else in formal evening wear, sneaks in and<strong> strangle</strong>s his victim with a very thin wire - a <em>thread</em>. Afterwards he <em>mingles</em> in with the crowd and disappears.	A serial killer goes to parties, to <em>mingle</em> with people and then<strong> strangle</strong> them with a thin <em>thread</em>.		
給		salary	Thread . . . fit.		12	1449	1349	36	キュウ	たま.う、たも.う、-たま.え	<em>Spiderman</em> wanted to be a <strong>salary</strong>man, but the suit just didn't <em>fit</em> him.	Spiderman has so little free time in his schedule that he is unable to fit in a job with a good<strong> salary</strong>.	The quality of the <em>threads</em> one wears generally <em>fits</em> with one's<strong> salary</strong>.	Did you know that Spiderman gets paid by the mayor for fighting crime? The only problem is that since he doesn't have a bank account, his<strong> salary</strong> is paid out in cash. And since he doesn't carry around a wallet, he has to somehow fit the bills in his costume: a few on his back, a few on his chest, etc.	If you earn a good<strong> salary</strong> it can help you to make ends meet – the ends of a thread.		
絡		entwine	Thread . . . each.		12	1450	1350	36	ラク	から.む、から.まる	When threads become<strong> entwine</strong>d, <em>each</em> <em>thread</em> is tangled to another.

Now, at US weddings, it ends with the couple driving away with cans being dragged behind the car. So here, think of SPIDERMAN, who will<strong> TIE</strong> the knot with Mary Jane. At his wedding, Spider THREAD attached (or<strong> TIE</strong>D) to SPRAYCANS are being drug behind the limo as they drive off."	"<em>Spidey</em> <strong>ties</strong> up the villain in a web of <em>threads</em>. ""<em>Good luck</em> getting out of that, heh heh!""."	<em>Spiderman</em> and a fan have a competition to see who can<strong> tie</strong> up the most enemies fastest.

Could this be the<strong> end</strong> of <em>spiderman</em>?	<em>Spider-Man</em> can't wait for <em>winter</em> to<strong> end</strong>. Going outside in spandex isn't exactly toasty.	The thread of life begins with the spring and<strong> end</strong>s with the winter.	"The final issue of <em>Spiderman</em>: ""Unable to afford the heating bill, <em>Spiderman</em> died that <em>winter</em>.

In a<strong> CHRONICLE</strong> the THREAD of the story can twist and turn like a SNAKE.	<em>Spider-Man</em> reads his <em>self</em>-chronicle every week when the newest comic comes out.	Spiderman's autobiography, written by his own self with no help, is titled The<strong> Chronicle</strong>s of a Web Weaver.	"I got the bizarre image of <em>Spider-Man</em> finding himself in Narnia, and crawling commando style through the snow by the lamppost is Solid <em>Snake</em> from MGS… Snake looks up, and there's a moment of awkward silence….

After <em>Spider-Man</em> is whacked in the head with a <em>I-beam</em>,<strong> crimson</strong> blood flows from the wound.	"As this kanji is used to describe black (or ""crimson"") English tea, think of the craftsmanship involved in the production of the tea, from the tea leaves, to the paper bag, right down to the thread you use to dangle it in the cup."	This artisan <em>crafted</em> the finest <em>thread</em> you could imagine. So fine it was that it had to be tinted in the deepest red (crimson) otherwise you wouldn't see it.	A person's first piece of <em>thread</em> <em>craft</em> is often stained<strong> crimson</strong> due to bleeding from the needle wounds sustained in the process.

By accident, he threw his spider webs <em>inside</em> the patient, causing his death. Fortunately, the hospital reached an out-of-court <strong>settlement</strong> with the victim's family.	Another twist on the same theme: malpractise<strong> settlement</strong> for leaving a plastic spiderman inside patient.	<em>Spiderman</em> was caught hanging upside down <em>inside</em> the girls changing room. The resulting public backlash and court-<strong>settlement</strong> were embarassing, but he still thinks it was worth it.	"Natto ( 納豆 ) is fermented soybeans.

"The easiest way to spin some <em>threads</em> is to hook them up to a <em>compass</em> and take them to the North Pole. The compass will spin like crazy and the threads will spin with it. I confuse this with <a href=""../v4/1967.html"">swing</a> (#1967 揺)."	Spiderman is<strong> spinning</strong> around, shooting webs in every direction.	A normal spider <strong>spins</strong> a web into a specific pattern in order to catch prey. <em>Spiderman</em>, however, uses his web primarily as a mode of transportation, shooting it in all <em>directions</em>.

He turned around and flew into a building. (""part"" also means ""minute"")."	Due to the <strong>distract</strong>ions of being a super-hero, <em>spiderman</em> can only work <em>part</em>-time. (variation on ayoung24's story).	<strong>Distract</strong> = to lose the <em>thread</em> of thought in <em>part</em>, i.e. not completely.

Here we see that it is a <em>spool</em> that is holding the <em>threads</em> together.	"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reasons: (1) <em>Toilet paper/roll</em> usually comes on a <em>spool</em>. (2) <em>Toilet paper</em> is used to clean the <em>soil</em> off your <em>crotch</em>.

Spool also appears in <a href=""../v4/715.html"">stalk</a> (#715 茎), <a href=""../v4/716.html"">suspicious</a> (#716 怪), <a href=""../v4/717.html"">lightly</a> (#717 軽), <a href=""../v4/882.html"">diameter</a> (#882 径)."	<em>Spiderman</em> is intriqued by some of the positions of the karma<strong> sutra</strong>, but reluctant to take part in an<strong> sutra</strong> orgy as he'd have to reveal his <em>soiled underwear</em>.	A<strong> sutra</strong> reads: time <strong>flows</strong> as a <em>thread</em> constantly <strong>flowing</strong> out of a <em>spool</em>.	<em>Spider-Man's</em> kama<strong> sutra</strong> technique is so crazy that he always needs a whole roll of <em>toilet paper</em> to clean up afterward. Mary Jane is always soaked in a sticky white substance, and it isn't Spidey's webs.		
紳		sire	Thread . . . monkey.		11	1461	1361	36	シン		Monkeys are very adept at swinging around trees. But when they met Spiderman, who could swing around even better than they could, they all quickly addressed him as<strong> sire</strong>.	You are now two-thirds of the way through the book! Keep it up!	<em>Spiderman</em> married a <em>monkey</em> and<strong> sire</strong>d a brood of spider-<em>monkeys</em>.	"When conversing with a<strong> sire</strong> (noble person) you should always use proper words like ""<em>speaketh</em>"" and allow them to set the <em>thread</em> of the conversation."	What do you call a monkey that wears the finest threads?<strong> Sire</strong> of course.		
約		promise	"Consider for a moment the etymology of the word ""<b>promise</b>"" in order to notice its roots in the activity of putting one thing (e.g., one's word of honor) in place of another (e.g., the fulfillment of a task). For as it turns out, this character also means ""to abridge, economize, and abbreviate"" - all activities that involve putting one thing in place of another. With that in mind, we may now work with the elements: <i>thread</i> . . . <i>ladle</i>."		9	1462	1362	36	ヤク		Anytime <em>Spiderman</em> breaks a<strong> promise</strong>, Aunt Mae hits him one over with her <em>ladle</em>.	"Spiderman<strong> promise</strong>d to get Aunt Mae's ladle back. He started to do a blood oath by spilling drops of blood but Aunt Mae stopped him and bound up the wound. ""It's only a ladle Peter""."	Thread + bound + drop of blood. Blood oath is a<strong> promise</strong>, where a drop of blood turns into a binding thread.	<em>Spiderman</em> broke his<strong> promise</strong> to be home in time for dinner. When he came in late, Aunt Mae beat him viciously with a <em>ladle</em>. She just kept hitting, and hitting, and hitting until he lost consciousness, and even then she still kept <em>ladling</em> his pulpy carcass for like fifteen more minutes. Don't break<strong> promise</strong>s to Aunt Mae.	<em>Spiderman</em> and Spiderwoman share a <em>drop</em> of blood (the blood handshake thing, like in Natural Born Killers) to <em>bind</em> their<strong> promise</strong> that they'll always fight crime. Ladle was too hard. <em>Spiderman</em><strong> PROMISE</strong>S to get MJs cooking <em>ladle</em> back.		
細		dainty	Thread . . . brains.		11	1463	1363	36	サイ	ほそ.い、ほそ.る、こま.か、こま.かい	<strong>Dainty</strong> women would always rather work with thread than in a field.	<em>Spider-Man</em> used to just be a<strong> dainty</strong>, <em>brainy</em> nerd.	Spiderman slips and smack his brain on a building… now he's sitting in the middle of the street pouring imaginary tea and acting<strong> dainty</strong>.	<em>Spider-Man</em>'s ideal type is a<strong> dainty</strong> girl with <em>brains</em>.	The threads of the brain (neurons) are<strong> dainty</strong>.		
累		accumulate	<i>Rice field</i> . . . <i>threads</i>. Make use of the position of the elements to distinguish this kanji from that of the previous frame.		11	1464	1364	36	ルイ		(dingomick) <em>Venom</em> is upset because Spidey is just that much brainier than he is! He chooses to<strong> accumulate</strong> as many <em>brains</em> as he can, snatching them out of people's heads and storing them on top of his own, till there's just one massive <em>brain</em> on top of his head!	When you<strong> accumulate</strong> knowledge in your <em>brain</em>, neural pathways are constructed. All those pathways end up like a huge ball of <em>thread</em> tangled together. The more knowledge you<strong> accumulate</strong> the more <em>threads</em> you throw into the mix!!	Like a jellyfish, a floating BRAIN<strong> accumulate</strong>s THREADS beneath it– a weird collection.	<em>Venom</em> is accumulating <em>brains</em> (much like Sylar in Heroes).	I found billyclyde's a bit abstract so I picture a <em>brain</em> rolling about the floor, accumulating <em>threads</em> scattered around and getting bigger as it rolls. (this is easy if you've played Katamari).		
索		cord	<i>Chapel</i> (see frame 930) . . . <i>thread</i>.		10	1465	1365	36	サク		Spiderman has been captured and given the ultimate torture: they forced a crown of needles on his head and attached it to an electrical<strong> cord</strong>, which they are about to plug into an outlet…	(modified akrodha's great story) VENOM has been captured by scientists and is being experimented on: they forced a CROWN of NEEDLES on his head and attached it to multiple electrical<strong> cord</strong>s, which are connected to a big machine.	An electrical<strong> cord</strong> has two (or three) prongs - <em>needles</em> - sticking out of it, a housing for the prongs that can be thought of as a <em>crown</em>, and the long <em>thread</em>-like wire leading to the appliance.	That's <em>venom</em> for you! Since he can't make webs like spiderman can, he's now desperately hanging from a thin<strong> cord</strong> that he bought cheap in Sweden. It cost him only <em>10 Kroner</em> (Crowns). I'm sure the<strong> cord</strong> will rip in a second or two. (Thanks desmidus).	A<strong> cord</strong> is made of <em>ten</em> <em>threads</em> <em>belted</em> together.		
総		general	This kanji, meaning universal or widespread, is composed of three elements: <i>thread</i> . . . <i>public</i> . . . <i>heart</i>.		14	1466	1366	36	ソウ	す.べて、すべ.て、ふさ	<em>Spiderman</em> could not achieve<strong> general</strong> acceptance by the media even after winning the <em>public</em>'s <em>heart</em>.	"<strong>NOTE</strong>: This kanji stands for [<strong>Total</strong>, All, whole, gross]. The Kanji commonly used for ""In<strong> general</strong>"" will appear later as <a href=""../v4/1871.html"">carrier</a> (#1871 般)."	To win<strong> GENERAL</strong> approval THREAD your way into the PUBLIC's HEART.	In <strong>general</strong>, spidey is accepted in the public's heart (see Spiderman1,2 and 3) Its only Jameson of the daily bugle that hates him (and a bunch of super villains). But in <strong>general</strong>, Spidey is in the public's heart, and the public is in Spidey's heart.	<strong>General</strong> or universal refers to the common thread running through the public's heart.		
綿		cotton	Thread . . . white . . . towels.		14	1467	1367	36	メン	わた	<em>Spiderman</em>'s polyethylene suit starts to ride up after a while, so he always looks forward to the <em>white</em><strong> cotton</strong> <em>towels</em> he wears while lounging around his apartment.	<strong>Cotton</strong> is the preferred <em>thread</em> for making <em>white</em> <em>towels</em>.

"Compare with <a href=""../v4/411.html"">brocade</a> (#411 錦). If the <em>white</em> <em>towel</em> is made of plain <em>threads</em> with no golden decoration, then it's just a plain towel. But at least it's a good fluffy<strong> cotton</strong> towel, not one of those cheap synthetic fibers. Remember: if it can't be golden (as in <a href=""../v4/411.html"">brocade</a> (#411 錦)), at least make it<strong> cotton</strong>."		
絹		silk	Thread . . . mouth . . . flesh.		13	1468	1368	36	ケン	きぬ	Spider-man loves to run his mouth all over Mary Jane's<strong> silk</strong>y flesh.	Spiderman has little squares in the flesh of his wrists that the<strong> silk</strong> webbing comes out of.	[silk] <strong>Silk</strong> is a <em>thread</em> that a larvae produces from its <em>mouth</em> to involve its <em>body</em>.	<em>Spider-Man</em> barged in on our honey<em>moon</em>, stuffing our<strong> silk</strong> sheets in his <em>mouth</em>–apparently he was out of webbing and needed to refuel.	Spider-man loves to use his <em>mouth</em> to remove Mary Jane's<strong> silk</strong> stockings and kiss the <em>flesh</em> underneath. (thanks Zazen666!).		
繰		winding	Thread . . . goods . . . tree.		19	1469	1369	36	ソウ	く.る	After stopping a bank heist, Spiderman is seen<strong> winding</strong> his webbing around the stolen goods to trap them in a tree until the police arrive to take them back.	"Tip: <em>goods</em> + <em>wood/tree</em> : This combination appears 4 times. I suggest calling it ""<em>furniture</em>"" (a common type of <em>wooden goods</em>).

Story: You are<strong> winding</strong> up your new <em>furniture</em> using a <em>thread</em> to get it through the window of your high-rise apartment."	<em>Spiderman</em> often accidentally breaks his <em>furniture</em> (thanks Katsuo!) with his spider strength, so he is often seen <strong>winding</strong> his webbing around various pieces to repair them.	Primary meaning of this kanji has to do with turning pages/leafing through a book so I focus on that meaning. Also taking the furniture suggestion from Katsuo about the primitive on the right and making it even more concrete by having it refer to IKEA. Here I see Spiderman reading an IKEA catalogue, he's lost in thought leafing through the pages.	<strong>Winding</strong> <em>thread</em> around <em>wood</em>en <em>goods</em> to ready them for safe transport.

A poor chinese fisherman could expect to <strong>inherit</strong>: the <em>thread</em> for his pole, a <em>hook</em> for catching something to eat, and some <em>rice</em> to live off of. (not concentrating on stroke order, sorry if that throws anyone off). (Adapted from bigloui,12-4-2006).	"The<strong> INHERIT</strong>ANCE given to SPIDERMAN was only RICE, because it came from his ""Uncle Ben"", ha ha ha, get the HOOK? ""Uncle Ben"" RICE? To be fair, I couldn't work hook into that tale very well."	"Uncle Ben <em>was</em> the employee that got the axe in <a href=""../v4/1136.html"">severance</a> (#1136 断), so naturally the <em>fishing hook</em> and <em>rice ball</em> is all that <em>spidey</em> will<strong> inherit</strong>."

緑		green	Thread . . . broom . . . rice grains.		14	1471	1371	36	リョク、ロク	みどり	<em>Spiderman's</em> nemesis the<strong> Green</strong> Goblin is in a slump; He's replaced his glider with a <em>broom</em> and is throwing <em>grains of rice</em> instead of bombs.	Tie<strong> green</strong> <em>thread</em> around the <em>broom</em> that you use for sweeping up <em>grains of rice</em> (ie the kitchen broom) to distinguish it from the other colour threaded brooms that you might use in say the toilet, or the garage etc…	Hint : I think of the little <em>broom</em> used for preparing Japanese<strong> green</strong> tea.	"Tip: <em>broom</em> + <em>rice grains</em> : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it may be worthwhile giving it a name. <a href=""../v4/1144.html"">record</a> (#1144 録) , <em>green</em> (FRAME 1371), <a href=""../v4/2145.html"">peel off</a> (#2145 剥), <a href=""../v4/2602.html"">salarium</a> (#2602 禄)."

縁		affinity	Thread . . . broom . . . sow.		15	1472	1372	36	エン、ネン	ふち、ふちど.る、ゆかり、よすが、へり、えにし	There once was a lonely little pig that constantly followed Spiderman, always nuzzling his leg and oinking tenderly. Spiderman finally caved in and decided to keep the little pig under one condition: the <em>pig</em> was to take a <em>broom</em> and sweep up all of <em>Spiderman's leftover threads</em> after having fought crime. The pig felt such<strong> affinity</strong> for Spiderman, he happily accepted—and did a good job too.	Spiderman has no<strong> affinity</strong> for a broom hence his house is a pig sty.	I hate doing this, since the Simpson's Movie was recent. But think of the<strong> AFFINITY</strong> Homer had with the PIG that was to be killed. The<strong> AFFINITY</strong> first had SPIDER PIG (Spiderpig, spiderpig, does whatever a spiderpig does). Then Homer dressed the PIG up with a BROOM and glasses making him Harry PORKER. Homer had more<strong> AFFINITY</strong> for that PIG than his family, hence hilarity ensues.	There is an<strong> affinity</strong> between the THREADS of a BROOM and a SOW's hair.	Spiderman, though genuinely a good person, had an<strong> affinity</strong> for beating <em>pigs</em> with a <em>broom</em>. (I know it's random, but the mental picture is both vivid and hilarious).		
網		netting	Thread . . . glass canopy . . . animal horns . . . perish.		14	1473	1373	36	モウ	あみ	<em>Spiderman</em> traps The Rhino under the <em>hood</em> of his famous<strong> netting</strong>, where even Rhino's <em>horns</em> can not break free, in fact if the<strong> netting</strong> did not dissappear after a few hours then Rhino might even <em>perish</em> in there.	You use a 糸 to make a net shaped like a hood. A stray animal got caught in it by its horns and perished.	Sadly, sometimes <strong>nettings</strong> have a <em>thread</em> so strong, the net gets caught like a <em>hood</em> on an animal's <em>horns</em>, and stays there until the poor thing <em>perishes</em>.	Spider-woman dies of a mosquito bite. They replace the (ineffectual)<strong> netting</strong> over her bed with a glass canopy, and put a viking's horned helmet on her dead head, so she can lie in state with dignity.	<em>Spiderman</em> caught The Rhino, under a <em>glass canopy</em>; instead of his usual webbed<strong> netting</strong>. But unfortunately, the <em>horned one perished</em>: he couldn't breathe. Next time spidey will stick to his traditional methods… (I prefer to say <em>horned one</em> rather than just <em>horned</em>, to remind myself of the extra stroke).		
緊		tense	Slave . . . crotch . . . thread.		15	1474	1374	36	キン		Whenever <em>Venom</em> is<strong> tense</strong>, he loses control of his sex drive and becomes a <em>slave</em> to his <em>crotch</em>.	You'd be<strong> tense</strong> too if you were a <em>slave</em> and your owner removed the <em>threads</em> covering your <em>crotch</em>.	"TIP: This is the first kanji in ""kinbaku"" ( 緊縛 ), the art of Japanese rope bondage. STORY: The <em>slave's</em> <em>crotch</em> is tied up with rope (<em>thread</em>) to heighten the sado-erotic <strong>tension</strong>… 緊張 [きんちょう]."	"The crotch-slave from ""intelligent"" this time has hidden some thread as part of her elaborate plan to escape from her owner. Now she's being searched, and is afraid they'll find where she hid the thread – she is quite<strong> tense</strong>, and it shows."	<em>Spiderman</em> is <em>slave</em> to his <em>crotch</em>, literally, because of that leotard he uses. If he get's just a little too excited in public, the situation would become very<strong> tense</strong> (if you know what I mean).		
紫		purple	Footprint . . . spoon . . . thread.		12	1475	1375	36	シ	むらさき	<em>Venom</em> starts to choke on a <em>spoon</em>.

Ok, I already finished RtK, I'm coming back to warn you about this one - the right primitive is <em>acupuncturist</em>, not <em>specialty</em>. Trust me, mixing these up will mess you up later.	Spiderman's specialty:<strong> truss</strong>ing up villains of course.	Spiderman gets <strong>truss</strong>ed/binded, tied by the new villain: the acupuncturist.

This is (in my opinion) a mistake in the RTK book, as we already decided in <a href=""../v4/537.html"">waterfall</a> (#537 滝) to refer to the simplified form of dragon as ""eels"". It is much better to call the right half of this character an ""unbound tortoise"".)."	When <em>Spiderman</em> fights the giant <em>tortoise</em>, he grabs a<strong> straw rope</strong> from the edges of the sumo ring and swings it at his head. However, the <em>tortoise</em> quickly tucks his head back into his shell to avoid the blow (hence no head on the <em>tortoise</em>).	A<strong> straw rope</strong> is made from <em>threads</em> and has about the thickness of an <em>eel</em>.	Our friendly neighborhood <em>Spider-Man</em> takes off the<strong> straw rope</strong> that was <em>binding</em> the <em>tortoise</em>.	<em>Spiderman's</em> threads conduct electricity a bit too well, so when he has to bind up <em>electric eels</em>, he just buys some<strong> straw rope</strong> at the post office and shoots it out of his arm.

幼		infancy	Cocoon . . . muscle.		5	1478	1378	36	ヨウ	おさな.い	In its<strong> infancy</strong>, a butterfly is protected by a <em>cocoon</em>, as it doesn't yet have any <em>power</em> of its own.	During their<strong> infancy</strong>, children are often wrapped up tight like a <em>cocoon</em> (i.e. in those Snugli carriers) and supported by the <em>muscle</em> of their parents.	During<strong> INFANCY</strong> the moth in its COCOON gains its POWER.

It is a little awkward when you are at a <em>fiesta</em> and the host serves some rare delicacy, like moth <em>cocoons</em>, the guests must decide <strong>how many</strong> it would be polite to eat. You do the math in your head and it comes out to two <em>cocoons</em> per <em>person</em>.

畿		capital suburbs	Two cocoons . . . field . . . fiesta.		15	1483	2887	36	キ	みやこ	People aside, I wonder <em>how many rice fields</em> there are in the<strong> capital suburbs</strong>.	<em>How many brains</em> does it take to run the<strong> capital suburbs</strong>?	This keyword refers to Japan's Kinki Region, a historic name for present-day Kansai. 近畿 きんき Just <em>how many rice fields</em> are in the<strong> capital suburbs</strong>? (The kinky (Kinki) <em>people</em> are hidden in the fields so you can't see them).	The<strong> capital suburbs</strong> were the five areas that around the kyoto nara osaka area that were under direct imperial rule (not ruled by the feudal lords) (the capital being first nara then kyoto) in this time the most important thing was how many rice fields you had. and as the area grew in the large cities that emporer had less and less rice fields (the latter half is not true).

玄		mysterious	Top hat . . . cocoon.		5	1484	1383	36	ゲン		What could be more<strong> mysterious</strong> than a <em>cocoon</em> in a <em>top hat</em> trying to sneak in…? (Pimitive: <em>GANDALF</em>).	The invisible man in his <em>top hat</em> and <em>cocoon</em> of white bandages is the most<strong> mysterious</strong> man in the world.	As romanrozhok said, this kanji has little to do with <strong>mysterious</strong>. It has the meanings [dark, abstruse, calm] (in Spanish, [moreno and recóndito]). As for the story, the union of a <em>hat</em> and a <em>coccoon</em> is obviously a fakir <em>turban</em>. India was maybe an <strong>abstruse</strong> place far away from China. Visualize a <strong>mysterious</strong>, <strong>dark-skinned</strong> fakir with a <em>turban</em> (in <strong>calming</strong> meditation) and the kanji is yours!	"This kanji does not really mean ""mysterious."" In fact, out of all the words this kanji in used in, only one, an uncommon word, has that meaning faintly. If you look the kanji up, you will see that it is used in: 玄関 【げんかん】 (n) entranceway; entry hall; (P)–and– 玄米 【げんまい】 (n) unpolished rice; unmilled rice; brown rice; (P) (as well as other ""unpolished grains.""

The livestock followed the lines, eating the flowers one by one, and<strong> amass</strong>ed in his field.	It may seem illogical, but the fact is, you need to plant <strong>flowers</strong> if your aim is to <em>amass</em> <strong>livestock</strong>.	"To keep the difference between<strong> amass</strong> and <a href=""../v4/559.html"">gather</a> (#559 集) and <a href=""../v4/1364.html"">accumulate</a> (#1364 累), I emphasize the MASS. To<strong> amass</strong> MASSIVE <em>livestock</em>, always feed them <em>flowers</em>. They'll get nice and plump. 蓄え = たくわえ = store; reserve; stock; savings."	Farmers in Japan grow flowers in the summer and rear livestock in the winter, in this way they<strong> amass</strong> a fortune.	I<strong> amass</strong>ed so many flowers from my many boyfriends, I had to feed them to my livestock to get rid of them.		
弦		bowstring	Bow . . . mysterious.		8	1487	1386	36	ゲン	つる	A magic <em>bow</em> that only <em>Gandalf</em> can yield: there is no<strong> bowstring</strong> on it, and he uses his magic to fire arrows.	A bow with a mysterious invisible<strong> bowstring</strong>.	TIP: This is used for string instruments, <strong>NOT</strong> bow & arrow. STORY: The greatest master of the violin <em>bow</em> and<strong> bowstring</strong> was the <em>mysterious</em> Paganini… 弦 [つる].	It was always (and still is) a bit <em>mysterious</em> to me just what type of<strong> bowstring</strong> was supposed to be used on Chewbacca's laser bolt cross<em>bow</em>.	Legolas asks Gandalf to conjure him a new<strong> bowstring</strong>.		
擁		hug	<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>mysterious</i> . . . <i>turkey</i>. Note that the <i>top hat</i> is extended across both elements, though it belongs only to the <i>cocoon</i>. This means that you may either use <i>mysterious</i> - as we did here - or take the three elements separately.		16	1488	1387	36	ヨウ		A <em>mysterious</em> <em>turkey</em> with human <em>finger</em>s wants to<strong> hug</strong> me… I will never go to Tokyo Disneyland again!	Imagine Gandalf<strong> hug</strong>ging a turkey….ouch! It bit off his finger!	Ok sweetheart, I want you to point your finger at the mysterious turkey who<strong> hug</strong>ged you inappropriately.	As you peer even more closely at the <em>top-hat</em> clad <em>cocoon</em> from frame 1383 you realise that it's actually ET in disguise, back on earth for Christmas (carrying a <em>turkey</em> from his home planet), and holding out a luminescent brown <em>finger</em> towards you. You leap up and give him a<strong> hug</strong>.	You can also break this into primitives as conjecture with mysterious stuck in the middle (I have enough finger and turkey primitives going through my head that I don't need any more…). As you<strong> hug</strong> your loved one who's going off on a mysterious mission, your conjecture is that you won't see them again.		
滋		nourishing	<i>Water</i> . . . double-<i>mysterious</i>. Note the doubling up of the element for <i>top hat</i> in the primitive for <i>mysterious</i> and assign it a special image, as it will come up in the next two frames.		12	1489	1388	36	ジ		Water is doubly mysterious. It's in all our nourishment…and yet, it's really not<strong> nourishing</strong> at all.	Going off the idea of the right side meaning rapid growth/increase of small objects, I've decided to make the right side be <em>Gremlins</em>, those little <em>mysterious</em> creatures that <em>double</em> rapidly. <em>Gremlins</em> find <em>water</em> a little too<strong> nourishing</strong>, as it makes them instantly multiply.	Because <em>Siamese twins</em> need twice as much fluid as their single body produces, the most<strong> nourishing</strong> thing they can have is <em>water</em>.	It’s <em>doubly mysterious</em> how <em>water</em> can be so<strong> nourishing</strong>—it doesn’t seem to have any substance and yet we would die without it.	"Gandalf (<a href=""../v4/1383.html"">mysterious</a> (#1383 玄)) finds<strong> nourishing</strong> water that reflects an evil double Gandalf looming beneath the surface."		
慈		mercy	Double-<i>mysterious</i> . . . <i>heart</i>.		13	1490	1389	36	ジ	いつく.しむ	<strong>Mercy</strong> comes from the doubly mysterious heart of God.	Two gremlins are atop a victim, tearing out his heart while he begs for<strong> mercy</strong>.	Here we see the DOUBLE-MYSTERIOUS Siamese twins again, at the<strong> MERCY</strong> of the machines that pump blood through their veins, since the single HEART they share won't do the job…	"Gandalf (<a href=""../v4/1383.html"">mysterious</a> (#1383 玄)) shows no<strong> mercy</strong> and rips his evil double's heart out. Instead of destroying evil, his malevolent act has merged the two of them into the grey Gandalf."	<strong>Mercy</strong> is a <em>doubly mysterious</em> turn of the <em>heart</em>. On the one hand, everybody wants it, but on the other hardly anybody gives it.		
磁		magnet	<i>Stone</i> . . . double-<i>mysterious</i>.		14	1491	1390	36	ジ		A<strong> magnet</strong> is a <em>rock</em> with two sides; one that <em>mysteriously</em> pushes and one that pulls; doubly mysterious. (see astridtops' story).	STONE + BAND OF NIGGERS: Band of niggers throwing rocks. Now that's a police<strong> magnet</strong>.	The gremlins have this mysterious rock the use to attract yet more gremlins.	I found some <em>stones</em> on the <em>siamese twins</em>. Turns out the <em>stones</em> were <strong>magnetic</strong>, and they weren't <em>siamese twins</em> at all!	In the old days, people didn't know what<strong> magnet</strong>s were. They just thought of them as <em>stones</em> that were <em>double mysterious</em>.		
系		lineage	The single stroke added to the beginning of the primitive for <i>thread</i> gives the image of threads woven into a single cord. Hence the meaning, <b>lineage</b>.	* As a primitive, we shall give this kanji the meaning of <i>yarn</i>, as the uniting of many threads into a single strand is most obvious with <i>yarn</i>.	7	1492	1391	36	ケイ		(Primitive: <em>DNA</em>, a drop of looong spiraled thread that is the key to your <strong>lineage</strong>).	Spiderman's<strong> lineage</strong> (who his family is etc…) can be found in his DNA in a drop of blood. The villain that gets blood of Spidey will be able to find out who is family and<strong> lineage</strong> is. be carfefull spidey…	A single <em>drop</em> of your blood holds the proof of the unbroken <em>thread</em> of your<strong> lineage</strong>.	One <em>drop</em> of <em>Venom</em>'s blood created a<strong> lineage</strong> of evil spiders.	Your<strong> lineage</strong> can be found in your DNA, a loooong molecular <em>thread</em> that can pulled from a single <em>drop</em> of blood.		
係		person in charge	Person . . . yarn.		9	1493	1392	36	ケイ	かか.る、かかり、-がかり、かか.わる	<em>Mister T</em> gets a <em>DNA</em> test, and discovers that he was meant to be the<strong> person in charge</strong> after all.	The<strong> person in charge</strong> usually must come from a long standing <em>lineage</em> of persons in charge.	<em>Mr. T</em> is the <strong>person in charge</strong> of the <em>DNA</em> research center.	<em>chuck norris</em> is always the<strong> person in charge</strong>! it's written in his <em>DNA</em>!	We think we have control over our own lives. But our DNA is the<strong> PERSON IN CHARGE</strong>. Our DNA controls our looks, and basically who we are.		
孫		grandchild	Child . . . yarn.		10	1494	1393	36	ソン	まご	Your <strong>grandchild</strong> is the child of your <em>DNA</em>.	Your <em>child</em> continues the family <em>lineage</em> by passing on your <em>DNA</em>, giving you a<strong> grandchild</strong>.	<strong>Grandchild</strong> is a kid of your directe lineage.	I didn't find out that child was my<strong> grandchild</strong> until I got a DNA test… I didn't even know I had a child until I got a DNA test for that matter!	"The child took a DNA test and found out that he was his own<strong> grandchild</strong>. ""What the fuck?! This doesn't even make sense with time travel involved. How did you figure this out with a DNA test anyway?""."		
懸		suspend	Prefecture . . . yarn . . . heart.		20	1495	1394	36	ケン、ケ	か.ける、か.かる	The <em>prefecture</em> has <strong>suspend</strong>ed all <em>DNA</em> research for <em>heart</em> disease because of corruption. All involved will be <strong>suspend</strong>ed by their wrists.	In a very racist <em>prefecture</em> of Japan, they screen everyone's <em>DNA</em>. If they find out you are of a different <em>lineage</em>, they rip out your <em>heart</em> and<strong> suspend</strong> it in the Hall of Shame.	Hint:<strong> suspend</strong> as in hang up.	The prefecture has<strong> suspend</strong>ed all research into inheritable (lineage) heart disease.	<strong>Suspend</strong>ed in the middle of the <em>prefecture</em> is a chart of the area's <em>lineage</em>. But, since this is Japan, it has to be cute, so the chart has been covered with little <em>hearts</em>.		
遜		modest	Grandchild . . . road.		13	1496	2422	36	ソン	したが.う、へりくだ.る、ゆず.る	My parents aren't at all<strong> modest</strong> about their <em>grandchildren</em>, at every opportunity they take them on the <em>road</em> showing them off to their friends!	"He wasn't at all<strong> modest</strong> when telling us about his <em>grandchildren</em> - ""They're all on the <em>road</em> to success"" he said."	"Swift wrote in ""A<strong> Modest</strong> Proposal"" that Ireland should solve its economic problems by collecting the nation's <em>grandchildren</em> from off the <em>streets</em> and eating them."	When grandparents take their grandchildren out on the <em>road</em>, they want them to be<strong> modest</strong> little children.	To instill a<strong> MODEST</strong> mindset in his GRANDCHILD, the grandpa sent him down the ROAD to find work instead of just giving him money.		
却		instead	Gone . . . stamp.		7	1497	1395	37	キャク	かえ.って、しりぞ.く、しりぞ.ける	[instead; on the contrary; rather] <em>Gone</em> is the time for <em>stamps</em> - use e-mail <strong>instead</strong>.	We use e-mail now<strong> instead</strong> of regular mail. My e-mail is <em>gone</em> before you can even put a <em>stamp</em> on your snail mail.	If you tried to attach money to an envelope to pay for postage it would be GONE before it arrived at the post office. That's why we use STAMPS<strong> instead</strong>.	"Having accidentally sent his children a home made sex video<strong> instead</strong> of the family Christmas tape, the man ran to the post office to switch packages. ""I'm sorry sir, but your package was <em>gone</em> moments after you paid for the <em>stamp</em>.""."	Lick soiled-elbow<strong> instead</strong> of stamp ?		
脚		shins	<i>Part of the body</i> . . . <i>instead</i>. This character has more or less the same meaning as that for <i>leg</i> learned back in frame 1372. It can also indicate the part of the legs from the <b>shins</b> down, which explains the choice of the key word.		11	1498	1396	37	キャク、キャ、カク	あし	<strong>Shins</strong> are the <em>part of the body</em> that Japanese traditionally sit on <em>instead</em> of their asses.	<strong>Shins</strong> are the <em>part of the body</em> that one uses <em>instead of</em> one's eyes, for finding furniture in the dark. (Ouch!).	This is one of the key aspects of soccer. At the beginning of every game you start by trying to kick the opponent's<strong> shins</strong>; their <em>flesh, instead</em> of the ball (lets them know you mean business).	In Western countries, women show who want to show a <em>part of their body</em> usually show cleavage. In Japan, they show their<strong> shins</strong> <em>instead</em>.	When you want to say<strong> shins</strong> you can use this kanji for that <em>part of the body</em> <em>instead</em> of the kanji for leg.		
卸		wholesale	The left primitive is a union of <i>a horse</i> and <i>footprint</i>. To the right, the <i>stamp</i>.		9	1499	1397	37	シャ	おろ.す、おろし、おろ.し	Selling<strong> WHOLESALE</strong> HORSES over the internet had to be STOPPED because the cost of STAMPS was too much.	If you need <em>horseshoes</em> (shoes that fit your <em>horse</em>'s <em>footprint</em>), buy them at the<strong> wholesale</strong> shop. They lick and paste <em>stamps</em> in your membership card so you can get free merchandise later.	A horse as a<strong> wholesale</strong>r: It <em>stamps</em> every contract with its <em>horse-footprint</em> (horseshoe) since it obviously can't write with its hooves.	"<strong>Wholesale</strong> refers to the sale of goods in quantity to retailers for resale. When this kanji was invented, large loads of goods needed to be transported by <em>horses</em> who left steep <em>footprints</em> because of the weight they carried. The<strong> wholesale</strong> goods needed a special <em>stamp</em> to indicate that they were legal for resale. See <a href=""../v4/1398.html"">honorable</a> (#1398 御)."	At Costco you can buy horses<strong> wholesale</strong>. Just remember that they charge you by the size of the <em>horse's footprint</em>, and you need to bring your own <em>stamps</em> for delivery.		
御		honorable	Line . . . wholesale.		12	1500	1398	37	ギョ、ゴ	おん-、お-、み-	An<strong> honorable</strong> man will not try to cut in front of the <em>line</em> at the <em>wholesale</em> stamp store. (Imagine just how much honor it takes facing those long lines at the post office!).	In front of the COLUMNS of the Capitol, the<strong> HONORABLE</strong> congressmen can be bought WHOLESALE.	When buying wholesale the<strong> honorable</strong> thing to do would be to wait in line like everyone else.	"Salesman: ""I'm <em>going</em> to do the<strong> honorable</strong> thing and sell you this item <em>wholesale</em>.""."	"<em>The Flash</em>, being an<strong> honorable</strong> person, zoomed around Costco <em>wholesale</em> helping everyone quickly find everything. (They honored him by using 御 (ご) a lot in their speech. <a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%BE%A1%E3%82%86%E3%81%A3%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8A%E3%80%81%E5%BE%A1%E3%82%81%E3%82%93"">御ゆっくり、御めん</a> etc.)."		
服		clothing	<i>Flesh</i> . . . <i>stamp</i> . . . <i>crotch</i>. Note how the <i>stamp</i> is stretched out here.		8	1501	1399	37	フク		It's customary to cover the <em>flesh</em> with<strong> clothing</strong>, but some designs are so outrageous they're not bigger than a <em>stamp</em> that just covers your <em>crotch</em>.	Modern<strong> clothing</strong> shows a lot of <em>flesh</em> – some is practically no more than a <em>postage stamp</em> covering your <em>crotch</em>!	The latest hype in<strong> CLOTHING</strong>, straight from the catwalk - models covered in STAMPS, revealing FLESH only at the CROTCH - hot!!!	On TV, people with no<strong> clothing</strong> on, <em>meat</em> swinging freely, have a black bar <em>stamped</em> on their <em>crotch</em>. ======.	The PART OF THE BODY that you must STAMP<strong> clothing</strong> on, no matter what, is your CROTCH!		
命		fate	This character connotes life in general, but also the particular life that is <b>fated</b> one by virtue of the distinctive character with which one is born. Its elements are: <i>fit</i> . . . <i>stamp</i>. The bottom portion of <i>fit</i> is nudged to the left in order to make room for the <i>stamp</i>.		8	1502	1400	37	メイ、ミョウ	いのち	When you're born, your<strong> fate</strong> is measured, <em>fitted</em>, and <em>stamped</em> onto your soul. Good luck defying it.	It is your<strong> fate</strong> to <em>meet</em> with a <em>mouth</em>, young <em>postage stamp</em>.	It is my<strong> fate</strong>/life to <em>fit</em> <em>stamps</em> together.	Was it<strong> fate</strong> that I was born with an <em>umbrella</em> hair-do, an <em>unibrow</em>, no pupils, and an eye shaped like a <em>stamp</em>?	Your<strong> FATE</strong> is sealed with your first kiss! (meeting of mouths). Just imagine a STAMP between the mouths that are meeting in the kiss…..(thanks CharleyGarret).		
令		orders	Meeting . . . chop-seal.		5	1503	1401	37	レイ		"(re: dingomick) ""These are your<strong> orders</strong>,"" declares the general while passing out documents at the <em>meeting</em>. As everyone started to leave, the general exclaims ""Oh wait! I need to certify these<strong> orders</strong>!"" and went around stamping each paper with his personal <em>chop-seal</em>."	"""These are your <strong>orders</strong>,"" declares the general at the <em>meeting</em> as he stamps them with his <em>chop-seal</em>.

I assigned this the primitive meaning of President Bush, giving crazy<strong> orders</strong> and letting everything go to his head.	At the <em>meeting</em> the chairman put a <em>chop-seal</em> mark on the official<strong> orders</strong>.		
零		zero	Rain . . . orders.		13	1504	1402	37	レイ	ぜろ、こぼ.す、こぼ.れる	The amount of people that can order the rain to rain.	Despite the <em>rain</em>, the <strong>zero</strong> pilot flies on. He has kamikaze <em>orders</em>.	<strong>Zero</strong> from Code Geas gives his <em>orders</em>, and as usual there's a <em>rain</em> of bullets and blood.	When it RAINS out, the ice cream store gets<strong> ZERO</strong> ORDERS.	<em>President Bush</em>'s <strong>zero</strong>-tolerance policies even apply towards the <em>rain</em>. He tries to <em>order</em> it around, as if it'll do any good…		
齢		age	This character is used to express the years of one's <b>age</b>. Its elements: <i>teeth</i> . . . <i>orders</i>.		17	1505	1403	37	レイ	よわ.い、とし	You know you are fast approaching a ripe old<strong> AGE</strong> when you get ORDERS from the dentist to get new TEETH.	"""Pull all their <em>teeth</em> to count their<strong> age</strong>!"" <em>orders</em> the insane Nazi general."	<em>Teeth</em> are an indicator of<strong> age</strong>: 1) None = baby, 2) milk teeth = child, 3) 2nd teeth = adult, 4) False = old. 1~3 are on <em>orders</em> from God, 4 is on <em>orders</em> from your dentist.	'What is your<strong> age</strong> Mr President' Bush opens his mouth and starts counting his teeth. (You role your eyes and expect him to say 32) '62' Bush says. Did he pull a joke on you are does he have trouble counting?	At your<strong> age</strong> false TEETH are the ORDER of the day.		
冷		cool	Ice . . . orders.		7	1506	1404	37	レイ	つめ.たい、ひ.える、ひ.や、ひ.ややか、ひ.やす、ひ.やかす、さ.める、さ.ます	To keep your water<strong> cool</strong>, just <em>order</em> some <em>ice</em>.	The Japanese boss gives an <em>order</em> at the meeting: eat <em>ice</em> to stay<strong> cool</strong> (since they won't be running the air conditioning anymore).	"<em>President Bush</em>'s drink isn't<strong> cool</strong> enough, and the Whitehouse is out of <em>ice</em>. ""Time to invade Alaska!"", <em>President Bush</em> says. ""But sir… we already own it!""."	"My superior says to me, ""You need to<strong> cool</strong> off, and that's an <em>order</em>!"" Just for emphasis, he dumps a bunch of ice cubes on my head."	Vanilla <em>Ice</em> <em>orders</em> you to stay<strong> cool</strong>.		
領		jurisdiction	Orders . . . head.		14	1507	1405	37	リョウ	えり	Two cowboys are crossing a state limit. One says to him “Did you know that in this<strong> Jurisdiction</strong> there are Orders to get your head?”, so he takes out his gun and shoots him. He claims the reward afterwards. (Thanks Fuaburisu).	<em>Orders</em> are given by the <em>head</em> person in any<strong> jurisdiction</strong>.	<em>President Bush</em>, with his swelled <em>head</em>, thinks everything is under his<strong> jurisdiction</strong>.	You're outside of your<strong> jurisdiction</strong>, Johnson! Show me your orders or I'll have your head.	"<strong>Jurisdiction</strong> just makes me think of ""sheriff"". So my story takes place in the<strong> jurisdiction</strong> of some sheriff. The sheriff goes into a bar and calls the waitress. He looks at one of those ""WANTED"" posters, with the portrait of a criminal he's been trying to catch for such a long time. When asked for his <em>orders</em>, still staring intently at the picture, he says : ""I want the <em>head</em> of that guy on a plate, yep, right now!"". The waitress scurried away and brought him just that : <em>orders</em> with a <em>head</em>."		
鈴		small bell	Gold . . . orders.		13	1508	1406	37	レイ、リン	すず	Some restaurants have a small gold bell to call someone to take customers' orders.	In high society, people ring a <strong>small</strong> <em>golden</em> <strong>bell</strong> to call their servants and give their <em>orders</em>.	<em>President Bush</em> has a<strong> small bell</strong>. It's made of <em>gold</em>. And everytime he has an <em>order</em> to give, he rings it to summon someone to write it down.	I use a <strong>small golden bell</strong> to issue <strong>orders</strong> to my underlings!	"This kanji refers to the <em>golden</em>,<strong> small bell</strong>s ( 鈴 =すず) that people ring at Shinto Shrines to communicate with gods who give <a href=""../v4/1401.html"">orders</a> (#1401 令) on how to acquire authority and repel evil spirits!"		
勇		courage	Chop-seal . . . man.		9	1509	1407	37	ユウ	いさ.む	I imagined some kind of initiation rite in old China, where every young <em>man</em> has to show his<strong> courage</strong>. They then receive a <em>chopseal</em> which is a mark of their<strong> courage</strong>.	Re: fuaburisu - The initiation rite in question is actually a reverse elbow chop to the <em>brain</em>, and you receive the <em>chop seal</em> if you have the <em>power</em> to withstand it. This initial imagery helps me with the altered <em>chop seal</em> and vertical placement.	A <strong>MA</strong> （マ） raises a <strong>man</strong> to have<strong> courage</strong>.	After showing sufficient<strong> courage</strong>, the young <em>male</em> gets a マ marked on their forehead with a hanko, to show they are now a マン.	"<strong>Note:</strong> Interesting kanji. It's actually not マ + 男 , but rather, this is an abbreviated form of 甬 + 力 , which gives it more of a meaning of 'path of power' or 'run through with power' or something like that. But if you don't care about the real origins and formation, either way of thinking of it works ^-^. (Source: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/oj4jes"">http://tinyurl.com/oj4jes</a> + <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/rcmnss"">http://tinyurl.com/rcmnss</a>). <strong>Story:</strong> To have<strong> courage</strong> is to <em>run through</em> (甬) with <em>power</em>. When that happens, a マ becomes a man ( 男 ). (Thx Captal)."		
湧		bubble up	Water . . . courage.		12	1510	2284	37	ユウ、ヨウ、ユ	わ.く	The <em>courageous</em> man who went into the <em>water</em> to save a drowning victim couldn't be seen, except by the air that <strong>bubbled up</strong>.	<strong>Bubble up</strong> the WATER and see who has the COURAGE to jump into it.	[+astrid] A very <em>courageous</em> man dove to the bottom of the <em>water</em> to save someone who had fallen in (and couldn't swim). The whole crowd was watching..30 seconds…a minute…1:20…are they both dead? Suddenly, a huge bubble rose to the surface, with the nearly-drowned victim - he <strong>bubble</strong>d <strong>up</strong> to the surface, in a bubble blown by the <em>courageous</em> man! And then soon after, the hero him self <strong>bubble</strong>d <strong>up</strong>. What a great story!	<em>Water</em> <strong>bubbling up</strong> is like a metaphor for being <em>courageous</em>, having a strength that will<strong> bubble up</strong> in times of need.	Think of the first time someone has to<strong> bubble up</strong> enough <em>courage</em> to take that first step into the <em>water</em>.		
通		traffic	<i>Chop-seal</i> . . . <i>utilize</i> . . . <i>road</i>. By combining the first two primitives into a single image, you will be able to use that image in a few instances later, one of which comes immediately.		10	1511	1408	37	ツウ、ツ	とお.る、とお.り、-とお.り、-どお.り、とお.す、とお.し、-どお.し、かよ.う	I bounce down the <em>road</em> on my <em>pogo stick</em>, easily getting through the dense<strong> traffic</strong>. (Note: New primitive: chop-seal + utilize = pogo stick. Because a <em>chop-seal</em> is long and thin with a rubbery bit at the end. If it were big enough, you could <em>utilize</em> it as a <em>pogo stick</em>). [Edit: <em>pogo stick</em> also appears in 1409, 1690, 2530].	Building on gorgon's story I now change mine to a much more silly and rememberable one. The Chinese police is using a helicopter to check and regulate the<strong> traffic</strong>. Hanging from the helicopter is a huge <em>chopseal</em> that they <em>utilize</em> to mark some of the cars that are causing trouble on the <em>road</em>.	<strong>MA</strong> （マ） drinks one too many <em>screwdriver</em>s and then drives off down the <em>road</em>. Unfortunately, she's so inebriated she causes a<strong> traffic</strong> accident.	They have built a new road downtown. It bypasses all the<strong> traffic</strong>. If your papers have been <em>chop seal</em>ed, you can <em>utilize</em> it.	"Same as Katsuo, but I remember ""utilize"" better as ""philips screw driver"". A long <em>screw driver</em> with a <em>chop-seal</em> on the end makes an interesting <em>pogo stick</em>."		
踊		jump	Wooden leg . . . chop-seal . . . utilize.		14	1512	1409	37	ヨウ	おど.る	The winner of the long<strong> jump</strong> competition was disqualified when they found he used a <em>pogo stick</em> tied to his <em>leg</em> to<strong> jump</strong> further.

Caveat Lector! Note: 舞 <a href=""../v4/1774.html"">dance</a> (#1774 舞) is quite a bit rarer (and not a homonym)."	"Heisig is triiippppiiiin'. This means dance, not<strong> jump</strong>. I named the other ""dance"" kanji ""interpretive dance"" because it is used in all sorts of concepts figuratively related to dance, like stages, fluttering, etc. One of my<em> legs is wooden</em>, the other is a <em>pogo stick</em>. Surprisingly, I'm actually a pretty good at <strong>dancing</strong>."	My wooden leg has a chop-seal at the end, but I have to<strong> jump</strong> so as to utilize it (so the chop-seal hits the right spot from above).

'lion feeding time is. bla bla' You are having serious<strong> doubt</strong>s about if you still want to go into this zoo.	A very<strong> doubt</strong>ful story: At the entrance to my local zoo they issue you with a special <em>spoon</em> (to feed the animals) and a <em>dart</em> gun (to defend yourself in case of animal attack). You must then <em>hanko</em> (<em>seal</em>) a document to say you’ve received both these items, only after which will they let you enter the <em>zoo</em>. (Oh, and if you forget your hanko, I<strong> doubt</strong> they’ll let you in).	Unless they use <em>spoons</em> to feed and <em>darts</em> to subdue the animals, I<strong> doubt</strong> the new <em>zoo</em> will get the WWF <em>seal</em> of approval.	In her spare time ( = ヒマ), Gwen Stefani of 'No<strong> Doubt</strong>' likes to throw <em>darts</em> at the critters in the <em>zoo</em>.	Hmm… I<strong> doubt</strong> he is as busy as he claims to be. Yesterday, he looked like he had plenty of ヒマ (free time) - I saw him shooting darts and going to the zoo!

"I <em>doubt</em> you can<strong> mimic</strong> all these animals with just your <em>fingers</em>: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Raymond"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Raymond</a>+Crowe%22+Letterman (shadow puppets – you'll love it!)."	Think of a<strong> mimic</strong> in Dungeons and Dragons, or a doppleganger: If you have <em>doubts</em> as to whether one of your party is genuine or a<strong> mimic</strong>, examine his fingers – they'll lack fingernails or finger prints, and in fact are a poor<strong> mimic</strong>ry of real fingers.	((<em><strong>Mimic</strong>: TREASURE CHEST WITH TEETH</em>)) If you try to loot a<strong> mimic</strong>, I <em>doubt</em> you'll be keeping your <em>fingers</em>.	I <em>doubt</em> that using my <em>fingers</em> to<strong> mimic</strong> rock stars on Guitar Hero will actually make me a good guitarist.		
凝		congeal	Ice . . . doubt.		16	1515	1412	37	ギョウ	こ.る、こ.らす、こご.らす、こご.らせる、こご.る	I <em>doubt</em> that the jello would<strong> congeal</strong> sitting on the counter, so I placed it in the <em>ice</em>box.	Is there any <em>doubt</em> that <em>ice</em> is<strong> congeal</strong>ed stuff?	I <em>doubt</em> that<strong> congeal</strong> is the right word to use when <em>ice</em> freezes.	When in <em>doubt</em>, <em>ice</em> your wound so the blood will<strong> congeal</strong>.	My blood<strong> congeal</strong>ed in my veins when I heard the cracking noise underfoot. I'd had <em>doubt</em>s about the condition of the <em>ice</em>, but… 凝る (こごる) : to<strong> congeal</strong>, to freeze; 凝らす (こごらす) : to freeze, to<strong> congeal</strong>.		
範		pattern	Bamboo . . . car . . . fingerprint.		15	1516	1413	37	ハン		This<strong> pattern</strong> made of <em>bamboo</em> is for a new model of <em>car</em> designed to leave as small an ecological <em>fingerprint</em> as possible.	How about a serial killer who's<strong> pattern</strong> is to drive by the victim and club them with a bamboo stick. Finally he makes a mistake and drops the bamboo stick, which is dusted for fingerprints.	There was a<strong> pattern</strong> to the murders. At the scene of the crime, there would always be a little BAMBOO left in the victim's CAR, but no human FINGERPRINTS… In other news, a vicious panda recently escaped the zoo.	I just had a new <em>bamboo</em>-leaf<strong> pattern</strong> spray-painted on my <em>car</em>. Don't touch it, you'll leave <em>fingerprints</em>! 範士 はんし kyudo master of the top rank; 範を垂れる はんをたれる to give an example; 範ちゅう はんちゅう category.

犯		crime	Wild dogs . . . fingerprint.		5	1517	1414	37	ハン、ボン	おか.す	<strong>Crime</strong>s can often be solved using the tools of dogs and fingerprints.	This<strong> crime</strong> gang has yet to be caught because their <em>pack of wild dogs</em> takes care of licking off the <em>fingerprints</em> from all the<strong> crime</strong> scenes.	"The hardened criminals <em>wild dogs</em> from <a href=""../v4/338.html"">prison</a> (#338 獄) ended up in prison after police found their <em>fingerprints</em> all over the<strong> crime</strong> scene."	Using Sherlock Holmes as <em>fingerprint</em>, then the classic<strong> crime</strong> is, of course, the <em>Hounds</em> of the Baskervilles…	They set a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> off on the scent and took <em>fingerprints</em> to solve the<strong> crime</strong>.		
氾		widespread	Water . . . fingerprint.		5	1518	2301	37	ハン	ひろ.がる	It's a<strong> widespread</strong> belief that they cannot find <em>fingerprints</em> on a body that has been deposited in the <em>water</em>.	It's a<strong> widespread</strong> belief that <em>water</em> takes away <em>fingerprints</em>.	To foil 犯人 , the use of <em>watermarks (water + fingerprint)</em> on banknotes is<strong> widespread</strong>. 氾 foils 犯 .	Warning: 氾濫 (flood) seems to be the only compound known to the WWWJDIC, so I propose this as an alternative keyword. The burglars <em>flooded</em> the mansion they broke into with <em>water</em>, thus leaving no <em>fingerprints</em> behind.	<strong>Widespread</strong> panic arises when they discover the WATER has FINGERPRINTS all over it– water thieves! And now,<strong> widespread</strong> water shortages.		
厄		unlucky	Cliff . . . fingerprint.		4	1519	1415	37	ヤク		Seeing some finger prints at the edge of a cliff, I wondered who that<strong> unlucky</strong> person was.	<em>Sherlock Holmes</em> is very<strong> unlucky</strong>: he just fell off a <em>cliff</em> while he was looking around for fingerprints.	She sure was <em>unlucky</em>! First of all, her car went off the <strong>cliff</strong>, right? After miraculously surviving the car crash, she managed to climb back up to the very edge of the <strong>cliff</strong>. See her <strong>fingerprints</strong> there? But then she sneezed, lost her grip, and fell to her death.	See a cliff with fingerprints on the edge? That means someone was<strong> unlucky</strong>.	At first the police thought it was murder when that guy fell off the cliff. They couldn't turn up any fingerprints so said it was just<strong> unlucky</strong>.		
危		dangerous	Bound up . . . unlucky.		6	1520	1416	37	キ	あぶ.ない、あや.うい、あや.ぶむ	You're <em>bound up</em> by ropes to an <em>unlucky</em> person. It's<strong> dangerous</strong>, because whatever happens to him will happen to you too.	While rock climbing you are bound to the cliff by just your fingerprints, which is why it's so<strong> dangerous</strong>.	…. continuing from the previous frame : it was very<strong> dangerous</strong> for the policeman to go down the <em>cliff</em> side to gather <em>fingerprints</em>, so his colleagues <em>bound</em> him with a rope just in case.	Being unlucky is bound to be<strong> dangerous</strong>. 危ない （あぶ）ない.	The <em>unlucky</em> person, the jinx, was <em>bound up</em> as he was considered<strong> dangerous</strong>.		
宛		address	House . . . mailbox.		8	1521	1417	37	エン	あ.てる、-あて、-づつ、あたか.も	Your<strong> address</strong> should be displayed on your <em>house</em> and <em>mailbox</em>.	For the primitive: This is a hi-tech Japanese <em>mailbox</em>, it automatically lights up in the <em>evening</em>, and has a biometric <em>fingerprint</em> scanner. — Each <em>house</em>'s<strong> address</strong>, even if it's hard to see in the <em>evening</em>, is like its own unique <em>fingerprint</em>.	Mailbox - i never get my evening paper but the paperboy says he delivers it. so here i am dustin gfor fingerprints everyevening checking for his new prints . roof and mailbox. superman is the newpostamn so the local people write their<strong> address</strong>es on their rooftops as well as their mailboxes.	Nowadays when you're asked your adress it has a double meaning : it's your HOUSE and your EMAIL BOX. N.B for the primitive mailbox : when you come back at home in the evening first thing you do is checking your mailbox and for that you need to give a fingerprint as your computer is locked.	When you send a letter you write the<strong> address</strong> of the <em>house</em> but it actually gets delivered to the <em>mailbox</em>.		
腕		arm	Part of the body . . . address.		12	1522	1418	37	ワン	うで	Like in Memento, I tattoo my <em>address</em> on my fore<strong>arm</strong> <em>flesh</em> so I don't forget it.	In Iraq people are having their addresses tattooed on their bodies, usually their<strong> arm</strong>s, so they can be identified if they are killed. (true story).	The part of the body that is good for writing someone's address down on when you have no paper at hand.	Your<strong> arm</strong> is the best <em>part of the body</em> to jot down a note: a girl's <em>address</em>, for example.	<strong>ARMstrong, Neil</strong> was the 1st to have an <em>address</em> in the <em>moon</em>.		
苑		garden	Flowers . . . mailbox.		8	1523	1419	37	エン、オン	その、う.つ	"Japanese ""<strong>gardens</strong>"" aren't anything more than a pot of <em>flowers</em> on top of the <em>mailbox</em>."	My mailbox is actually right in the middle of my<strong> garden</strong>, which kind of sucks since the mailman has to trample all my flowers to get to it.	You call flowers on top of your mailbox a<strong> garden</strong>!? Get me out of this 1LDK!	(cf akrodha) The mailman has to be careful when delivering Hyacinth Bouquet's post. Her <em>mailbox</em> is in her<strong> garden</strong>, surrounded by fragile <em>flowers</em>. If he were to step on even one of those, he'd be in major trouble…	It is common to see a tiny<strong> garden</strong> of <em>flowers</em> surrounding a<em>mailbox</em>.		
怨		grudge	Mailbox . . . heart.		9	1524	1420	37	エン、オン、ウン	うら.む、うらみ、うら.めしい	I couldn't drop my <strong>grudge</strong> against him. So I put a severed pig's <em>heart</em> in his <em>mailbox</em>. He got the message.	I had a little <strong>grudge</strong> against my ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend…so I ripped out his <em>heart</em> (like in indiana jones and the temple of doom) and then I left it in her <em>mailbox</em>.	Remember The<strong> Grudge</strong> movie? Instead of coming out from the attic, the girl comes out from the <em>mailbox</em> to rip your <em>heart</em> out.	Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, had a<strong> grudge</strong> in his <em>heart</em> so he sent letter bombs to various <em>mailboxes</em>.	Someone left a copy of the movie The<strong> Grudge</strong> in your mailbox. Your heart thumps in your chest wondering who was it and why?		
柳		willow	Tree . . . receipt . . . stamp.		9	1525	1421	37	リュウ	やなぎ	Having decided to use SIGN OF THE HARE rather than RECEIPT and STAMP my mnemonic goes as follows: The<strong> WILLOW</strong> is the TREE that droops likes a HARE's ears.	A strange thing about the japanese<strong> willow</strong> tree is, it grows eggs… but the eggs have no yokes. weird eh?	I ordered a<strong> willow</strong> <em>tree</em> off Amazon but when it arrived it was covered in postage <em>stamps</em>. I try to peel them off but it ends up leaving a papery mess and cheapifies the<strong> willow</strong>'s appearance. Luckily I kept a <em>receipt</em>.	At the<strong> Willow</strong> Tree Nursery first you pick up your <em>tree</em> you can leave the lot when you show your <em>receipt</em> .. you also get a <em>stamp</em> for your next purchase.	A<strong> willow</strong> <em>tree</em> looks like it has <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em> hanging off it.		
卵		egg	<i>Receipt</i> . . . <i>stamp</i> . . . and <i>a drop</i> in each side to represent a little smear of <b>egg</b> yoke. The third stroke is drawn slightly higher to close the <b>egg</b> up tightly and keep the yoke inside.		7	1526	1422	37	ラン	たまご	The <em>Easter Bunny</em> dropped an <strong>egg</strong> on my desk and got yolk all over my <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em>.	The Easter Bunny (<em>hare</em>) drops a few <em>drops</em> of<strong> egg</strong> yolk while hiding easter<strong> Egg</strong>s.	The Easter Bunny is hiding an easter<strong> EGG</strong> in each of its ears.	Sorry folks, but this looks like a pictogram of male private parts, with dots marking the<strong> egg</strong>-shaped bits.	Simple: Pictogram of the cracking of an<strong> egg</strong>.

留		detain	Receipt . . . dagger . . . rice field.		10	1527	1423	37	リュウ、ル	と.める、と.まる、とど.める、とど.まる、るうぶる	Got a <em>receipt</em> for that <em>dagger</em>, son? If not, we're going to <strong>detain</strong> you and send you to work in the <em>rice fields</em>.	The use of RANSOM NOTE (think of a receipt with a dagger through it on a door) works great with<strong> DETAIN</strong>. Here the RANSOM NOTE says that the girl has been<strong> DETAIN</strong>ED in an undisclosed location. To get her back take the RANSOM to a empty FIELD.	"""We're<strong> detain</strong>ing you because we found a receipt on you for this dagger we found in the brain of the man your wife was having an affair with. Care to explain?""."	The 留学生 【りゅうがくせい】went over to Japan on an international exchange program, but on his way from the airport he was <strong>detained</strong> by slave traders! They took his student-visa <em>receipts</em> and kept him under <em>knife point</em> working in the <em>rice fields</em>.	We finally have enough evidence to<strong> detain</strong> the susppect. The <em>knife</em> used in the murder was found in his <em>rice field' out back, and the </em>receipt* for it was in his desk drawer.		
瑠		marine blue	Jewel . . . detain.		14	1528	2555	37	ル、リュウ		“The <em>king</em> has been <em>detained</em> by some marines!” “How do you know they were marines?” “Because they were wearing<strong> marine blue</strong>.”.

貿		trade	<i>Receipt</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>shells</i>. Though the meanings are related, do not confuse with <i>make a deal</i> (Frame 471) or <i>wholesale</i> (Frame 1499).		12	1529	1424	37	ボウ		There's a buyback program where you can<strong> trade</strong> in your <em>dagger</em> for <em>money</em>. But it's quite ineffective, since only registered dagger-owners with the <em>original receipts</em> can participate, and not criminals with illegally-purchased daggers.	The new RANSOM note (a receipt stuck to a door with a dagger) from DETAIN (1423) appears again (probably after you went to the field as instructed) now gives instruction to<strong> TRADE</strong> the victim for CURRENCY you were told to bring.	Here is my <em>receipt</em> and here is my <em>dagger</em>. Now give me my <em>money</em> back! Isn't that a fair<strong> trade</strong>?	A fair<strong> trade</strong> means some <em>shells</em> (money) and a <em>receipt</em>. An unfair<strong> trade</strong> (robbery) means a <em>dagger</em> and no <em>receipt</em>.	[trade; exchange] The ancient tools-of-the-<strong>trade</strong> for trading are: <em>receipts</em>, <em>shells</em> and a <em>dagger</em> (to persuade a trading part that refuses to give the first or the second).		
印		stamp	At last we come to the general character meaning <b>stamp</b>. Its elements: <i>staples</i> . . . <i>stamp</i>.		6	1530	1425	37	イン	しるし、-じるし、しる.す	Before sticky backs, they had to staple<strong> stamp</strong>s to letters.	Aaaagh, this old<strong> stamp</strong> doesn't <em>stick</em>! Okay I'll just <em>staple</em> it.	A<strong> stamp</strong> for the 印 velope of course!	If you are sending a letter from IN-dia [this Kanji is used for the country name], staple the<strong> stamp</strong> to your letter, or it might get steamed off and resold. イン 印刷 いんさつ(printing).	Staple and<strong> stamp</strong>, staple and<strong> stamp</strong>: the life of your average Japanese いんかん（ 印鑑 ） wielding office worker.		
臼		mortar	The image here is of <i>back-to-back staples</i>. The <b>mortar</b> referred to in this key word is a stone or wooden basin used for grinding with a pestle.		6	1531	2063	37	キュウ、グ	うす、うすづ.く	I removed all the <em>back to back staples</em> and grinded them in a<strong> mortar</strong> to create metal dust.	The<strong> mortar</strong> bomb exploded, ripping the sun in half.

I went pictograph with this one: a <em>cracked white rice grain</em>–one that has been bashed in a<strong> mortar</strong>.	<strong>Mortar</strong> is that goop, prepared on a board (which this pictographically resembles) that works like DOUBLE-STAPLES to hold bricks together.

He's trying to<strong> BREAK</strong> his MORTAR by throwing it to the SOIL. Whoa! Now he's aiming a MISSILE at it!	"To ""<strong>break</strong> the <em>soil</em>"" is to make a symbolic gesture that indicates the beginning of construction. Like when a politician in a hardhat gets a shovel and lifts a piece of dirt. This particular project is behind schedule, so to speed things up, they blow it up with <em>mortar</em> and an air-to-ground <em>missile</em>."	"Drawing inspiration from <a href=""../v4/709.html"">beat</a> (#709 撃) by kinkypete, this kanji shows the rules for a bizarre form of janken (paper, stone, scissors). A mortar can<strong> break</strong> soil (grinding it to dust). Soil can<strong> break</strong> a missile (burying it - causing it to eventually rust away). And a missile can<strong> break</strong> a mortar."	You'll<strong> break</strong> everything down to <em>dirt</em> if you use both <em>mortars</em> and <em>missiles</em>.	Someone tried to<strong> break</strong> into <em>Staples</em> using a <em>missile</em>, but it ended up<strong> break</strong>ing the whole store, turning it to <em>dirt</em>.		
興		entertain	<i>Mortar</i> . . . <i>same</i> . . . <i>tool</i>. Be careful to make an image that keeps <i>same</i> in the middle.		16	1533	1426	37	コウ、キョウ	おこ.る、おこ.す	To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be<strong> entertain</strong>ed. Unfortunately in this city, every store is the <em>same: staples</em>. What <em>tools</em>! [ayoung24].	Photographically, this kanji simply looks like a set of two speakers (the staples primitives) between the sub-woofer (primitive for same) – all this as a tool to<strong> entertain</strong> a group of drunks at a club.	Wacky Japanese TV <strong>entertain</strong>-ment show: a <em>monk</em> is <em>stapled</em> to the wall on both sides with huge <em>staples</em>, whilst contestants throw <em>tools</em> at his face.	This is a pictograph an <strong>entertainment</strong> system (two speakers left and right of the main unit, which has a CD slot and a tape deck) on a table-top.	Whenever I go to <em>Staples</em> I end up looking at the <em>same tools</em> every time (PDAs, printers, etc.) but it manages to<strong> entertain</strong> me.		
酉		sign of the bird	Though we shall later encounter the kanji for <i>bird</i>, we introduce this one for the tenth sign of the zodiac mainly because of its use as a primitive, where it has a different meaning.	"* As a primitive, it means <i>whiskey bottle</i>. In its pictograph, you can see the loosely corked lid, the bottle and the contents (about one-third full). You might also think of the Spanish ""porrón,"" a decanter shaped like a long-necked bird."	7	1534	1427	38	ユウ	とり	The<strong> sign of the bird</strong> on this whiskey bottle is of course the Famous Grouse blended Scotch.	"Normally birds fly south, but <em>one</em> bird flew <em>west</em>. People were worried about it and kept asking ""Is there any<strong> sign of the bird</strong> – you know, the <em>one</em> that flew <em>west</em>?""."	It's time for a drinking game everyone! If you see the<strong> sign of the bird</strong>, take a drink from your whiskey bottle.	The<strong> Sign of the Bird</strong> on Greygoose Vodka. It's got such a fancy bottle, but I think Absolut tastes smoother.	The driver had drunk too much <em>whiskey</em> and was driving too fast, giving all the slow drivers the<strong> sign of the bird</strong>.		
酒		saké	Water . . . whiskey bottle.		10	1535	1428	38	シュ	さけ、さか-	<strong>Sake</strong> is just watered down whisky.	<strong>Sake</strong> is the generic term for alcohol (not just japanese rice wine). And a very popular alcoholic drink in Japan is <em>whiskey</em> and <em>water</em>.	<strong>Sake</strong>. Looks like <em>water</em>, tastes like <em>whiskey</em>. (thanks Bodhisamaya).	If you forget this Kanji and you watch a lot of Anime then don't study Japanese.	<strong>Sake</strong> is the <em>liquid</em> that comes out of the <em>sake bottle</em> - and when ever there's a<strong> sake</strong> drinking competition, all the delicate women shoo (しゅ) away. (Readings: しゅ、さけ、さか、ざか).		
酌		bartending	Whiskey bottle . . . ladle.		10	1536	1429	38	シャク	く.む	At the local pub, their<strong> bartending</strong> practises are unusual. They serve the <em>whiskey</em> by pouring it from a <em>ladle</em>, like one would from the punch bowl.	Ever seen the anime Bartender?<strong> Bartending</strong> isn't just about <em>bottles of whiskey</em>, it's about <em>ladling</em> out advice.	Old fashioned<strong> bartending</strong> had the server ladle out the alcohol from a giant whiskey bottle.	"Coyote Ugly! The girls <strong>""bartending""</strong> in the bar don't use <em>whiskey bottles</em> - they use <em>ladles</em> and pour everything over their bodies. What a show! Where was the bar exactly?"	<strong>Bartending</strong> consists mainly of giving the customer the proper amount. That's why they dispense from a <em>whiskey bottle</em> into a special <em>ladle</em> to measure the RIGHT amount.		
酎		hooch	This kanji is used for thick, low-grade saké made from various kinds of grains. Its primitives are: <i>whisky bottle</i> . . . <i>glue</i>.		10	1537	2748	38	チュウ、チュ	かも.す	"While the keyword is ""hooch"", this usually means 焼酎 . It has similar effect as whiskey and sniffing glue has: you get intoxicated."	Tastes like whiskey, smells like glue? Then it must be しょうちゅうの「ちゅう」 (<strong> hooch</strong> ). - There you go, reading meaning and a catchy ad jingle, all in one. Possibly the best story I've written. ^^.	I combined WHISKEY and GLUE to make<strong> HOOCH</strong>.	"焼酎 , 酎ハイ , 芋焼酎 <a href=""../v4/2748.html"">hooch</a> (#2748 酎) チュウ … Parts: 酉 , 寸 … Cultural Note: Shochu ( 焼酎 ) now outsells Sake ( 日本酒 ) in Japan, so even though Heisig Calls it<strong> hooch</strong>, and Spahn calls it low-grade liquor, Shochu is more popular than Sake. So don't be comparing it to sniffing glue dammit."	This thick, illicitly-made beverage is actually just <em>whiskey</em> mixed with <em>glue</em>!		
酵		fermentation	Whiskey bottle . . . filial piety.		14	1538	1430	38	コウ		The secrets of<strong> fermentation</strong> are passed to the son who displays the most filial piety.	Since <em>filial piety</em> is all about respecting ones elders, and the older a <em>whiskey bottle</em> is (i.e. the time it have spent undergoing<strong> fermentation</strong>) the more respect you should give it, the meaning of this kanji becomes clear. If it doesn't, sink back some whiskey and it will.	Add a phrase to Raichu's story: The secrets of<strong> fermentation</strong> are written on a <em>whiskey bottle</em> and passed to the child who displays the most <em>filial piety</em>.	In a family of alcoholics, <em>filial piety</em> is saving the more <strong>fermented</strong> <em>whiskey</em> for the elders.	The boy throws the body of the old man in the whiskey barrel. There he lets<strong> fermentation</strong> do his work. The best whiskey ever.		
酷		cruel	Whiskey bottle . . . revelation.		14	1539	1431	38	コク	ひど.い	It's<strong> cruel</strong> to pour alcohol down a cow's mouth.	Offering whiskey to people to encourage them to make revelations is<strong> cruel</strong>.	There is a saying that a drunk man's words are a sober man's thoughts. Be careful about giving someone a <em>bottle of whiskey</em>, you may get some <em>revelations</em> about their<strong> cruel</strong>ty. Of course, they'll just say that it's the whiskey speaking.	Some people when they drink too much alcohol start to tell the truth about everything. Unfortuantly some of these revelations can be rather<strong> cruel</strong>, at least you find out exactly what they think of you.	This one seems too obvious. Drinking too much whiskey makes for some<strong> cruel</strong> revelations as you stop watching what you say to your friends. Hey, your girlfriend is a good kisser!		
酬		repay	Whiskey bottle . . . state.		13	1540	1432	38	シュウ、シュ、トウ	むく.いる	Imagine a different kind of tax refund - instead of money, the state<strong> repay</strong>s you with whiskey.	Hint: bottle deposit refund - the state will<strong> repay</strong> the recycling deposit for each alcohol bottle returned.	If you take your <em>whiskey</em> across a <em>state line</em>, you'll have to<strong> repay</strong> the liquor tax in the new state.	"True story, the former communist <em>state</em> of Russia was once so poor it<strong> repay</strong>ed it's teachers with <em>vodka</em> <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/177421.stm"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/177421.stm</a>."	<em>States</em> like Michigan<strong> repay</strong> you for returning your <em>whiskey bottles</em>.		
酪		dairy products	Whiskey bottle . . . each.		13	1541	1433	38	ラク		To stay healthy, Dr. Phil told me to have some<strong> dairy products</strong> with each bottle of whiskey I drink…	In an attempt to increase sales of<strong> dairy products</strong>, the grocery store is giving away a free miniature <em>whiskey bottle</em> with <em>each</em> dairy product you buy.	The makers of Bailey's Irish Creme <em>add</em><strong> dairy products</strong> to <em>each</em> of their <em>bottles of whiskey</em>, creating one of the most delicious alcoholic beverages known to mankind.	<strong>Dairy products</strong> go bad so often, you can get sick if you eat or drink them, unless EACH one is accompanied afterwards by a shot from a WHISKEY BOTTLE. The alcohol kills the bacteria and warms your innards.	Put a little <em>whisky</em> in baby's<strong> dairy products</strong> at <em>each</em> feeding time to ensure sound sleep.		
酢		vinegar	Whiskey bottle . . . saw.		12	1542	1434	38	サク	す	Drinking alcohol that's turned to<strong> vinegar</strong> feels like a saw going down your throat.	I spent ages <em>saw</em>ing that <em>whiskey bottle</em> open, but when I got in, it had all turned to<strong> vinegar</strong>!	<em>Yesterday</em>'s <em>alcohol</em> turns into today's<strong> vinegar</strong>. (Yesterday = day + <em>saw</em>.).	To determine wether the bottle contains<strong> vinegar</strong> or <em>whiskey</em>, you have to <em>saw</em> it open.	When the <em>whiskey</em> turns to<strong> vinegar</strong>, the taste is sharp like a <em>saw</em>.		
酔		drunk	Whiskey bottle . . . baseball . . . needle.		11	1543	1435	38	スイ	よ.う、よ.い、よ	God you're <strong>drunk</strong>! How many <em>whiskeys</em> did you have? <em>9</em>? <em>10</em>?	Whiskey with 90 percent alcohol will get you<strong> drunk</strong>. I don't care who you are.	As Ernest Hemingway said, it only takes one drink to get me<strong> drunk</strong>. But I'm not sure if it is the ninth or tenth drink that does it. [from dingomick].	99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer, take one down, pass it around 98 bottles of beer on the wall, etc; getting<strong> drunk</strong>, just remembering the '90' part.	You will get<strong> DRUNK</strong> if you drink WHISKEY that is 90 proof (NINE and TEN).		
配		distribute	Whisky bottle . . . snake.		10	1544	1436	38	ハイ	くば.る	To<strong> DISTRIBUTE</strong> <em>WHISKY</em> during Prohibition you had to be as sneaky as a <em>SNAKE</em>.	In Japan, it's rude to<strong> distribute</strong> the <em>sake</em> to your <em>self</em> before anybody else.	Those who have studied physics may find this useful. The two parts of the kanji represent the two statistical <strong>distribution</strong>s for bosons and fermions. The Bose-Einstein <strong>distribution</strong> is represented by the <em>sign of the bird</em> because birds, like bosons, are social creatures who like to flock together. The Fermi-Dirac <strong>distribution</strong> is represented by a <em>snake</em>, since <em>snake</em>s, like fermions, are solitary creatures who like to keep to themselves.	"Do a google search for ""Laotian Snake Whisky""… yes snake whisky does exist !. Now you only have to found their distributor to get yourself a botle !"	"Sir, you're under arrest for <strong>distributing</strong> <em>alcohol</em> to <em>snakes</em>. ""WHAT?? They told me they were worms!!""."		
酸		acid	Whiskey bottle . . . license . . . walking legs.		14	1545	1437	38	サン	す.い	The <em>prostitute</em> carries an old <em>whiskey bottle</em> filled with <strong>acid</strong> to throw at any difficult Johns.	Dealing <em>alcohol</em> requires a <em>license</em>, dealing<strong> acid</strong> requires fast <em>legs</em> (to run from the police).	I stopped doing <strong>acid</strong>, and am living the clean life. Well, aside from all the <em>whiskey</em> and <em>prostitutes</em>.	The punishment for people who sell <em>whiskey</em> without a <em>license</em> is harsh:<strong> acid</strong> is poured onto their <em>walking legs</em>.	Sometimes ppl put<strong> acid</strong> into their <em>alcohol</em> to make it taste bad (so you won't want to drink it anymore). this guy uses this technique to give up drinking <em>alcohol</em>, since due to the number of his DUIs he had gotten his driver's <em>license</em> suspended and thus must make use of his <em>walking legs</em> (an inconvenience!).		
猶		waver	Wild dogs . . . animal horns . . . whiskey bottle.		12	1546	1438	38	ユウ、ユ	なお	The<strong> waver</strong> for this kanji means to hesitate. I<strong> waver</strong>ed before going into the bar with a bunch of horned wild dogs drinking whiskey straight out of the bottle.	For the right primitive: Red Bull (the energy drink). Can be mixed with alcohol and gives you wi- uh, horns. Coincidentally, also the name of the Indian CHIEFTAN in frame 2906. (Thanks Katsuo).	"Tip: <em>horns</em> + <em>whiskey bottle</em> : This combination of primitives appears five times in Heisig, including as a separate kanji 酋 <a href=""../v4/2906.html"">chieftain</a> (#2906 酋). REF: <a href=""../v4/1439.html"">revered</a> (#1439 尊), <a href=""../v4/2425.html"">courtesy</a> (#2425 鄭), <a href=""../v4/2493.html"">Japanese oak</a> (#2493 楢). Edit: Note that in some fonts <em>horns</em> are replaced by <em>eight</em> 八 ."	. Have you ever had Wild Dog brand whiskey? That stuff is downright evil. So evil, the bottle has horns, and you need to sign a<strong> waver</strong> before you drink it. Because of this warning you will surely<strong> waver</strong> as you bring the shot glass to your lips.	I<strong> waver</strong>ed when the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> was blocking the way, but then I drank some <em>Red Bull</em> and charged through. (thanks shakkun).		
尊		revered	Animal horns . . . whiskey bottle . . . glue.		12	1547	1439	38	ソン	たっと.い、とうと.い、たっと.ぶ、とうと.ぶ	I drank the <em>Devil Whiskey</em> and was <strong>revered</strong> by all. Too bad I had to have my anus <em>glued</em> shut from the damage it did to my digestive system…	"<em>Red Bull</em>, the <a href=""../v4/2906.html"">chieftain</a> (#2906 酋) is so<strong> revered</strong> in his clan that everyone sticks to him like <em>glue</em>."	Have you seen people who save their empty alcohol bottles? Some of them take the reverence too far, and <em>glue</em> the<strong> revered</strong> <em>bottle of whisky</em> to the wall, mounted like a rack of <em>animal horns</em>.	A <em>whiskey bottle</em> collector discovers a bottle where the glass has been shaped into <em>horns</em>. He likes it so much, he <em>glues</em> it to his mantelpiece. The most<strong> revered</strong> item in his collection.	The<strong> revered</strong> TV evangelist turned out to be nothing but a HORNy, ALCOHOLic degenerate who also sniffed GLUE.		
豆		beans	This kanji depicts a pot of <b>beans</b>, although it looks more like a table on which the pot is resting.	* As a primitive, this kanji will mean <i>table</i>.	7	1548	1440	38	トウ、ズ	まめ、まめ-	If I eat<strong> BEANS</strong>, after <em>ONE</em> <em>MOUTHful</em> I fart like some kind of <em>HORNED ANIMAL</em>.	I hate using primitives that are completely unrelated. Let's call this one Mr. Bean! He's an easy character to build stories with.	Looks like a pot of refried<strong> beans</strong> on top of a stove to me with a top over the pot.	<em>One</em> <em>mouth</em>ful and you spit them on the <em>floor</em> (<em>two drops</em> of spit out<strong> beans</strong>). I'm talking about 納豆 (natto) of course.	<strong>BEANS</strong> are served on the TABLE. It's a simple pictograph, so force the issue here.		
頭		head	Here we meet at last the full kanji on which the primitive for <b>head</b> is based. The elements: <i>table</i> . . . <i>head</i>.		16	1549	1441	38	トウ、ズ、ト	あたま、かしら、-がしら、かぶり	The<strong> head</strong> of the family sits at the<strong> head</strong> of the <em>table</em>.	<em>Mr. Bean</em> has a funny <strong><em>head</em></strong>.	Mr <em>Bean</em>'s <em>head</em>.	Which one is the <strong>head</strong> <em>table</em>? Well, it's the <em>table</em> with the <strong><em>head</em></strong> sitting beside it, isn't it?	Sometimes old men refer to your<strong> head</strong> as your noggin, your noodle, or your <em>bean</em>.		
短		short	Dart . . . table.		12	1550	1442	38	タン	みじか.い	He's so <strong>short</strong>, he can't even throw over a <em>table</em> while playing <em>darts</em>.	Sort of like ping pong, this kanji represents a game where you throw <em>darts</em> over a <em>table</em> at your opponent. The serve is rarely returned, so the games tend to be<strong> short</strong>.———— This character apparently refers to duration, not just to height.	<em>Mr. Bean</em> somehow finds himself in an archery contest. He has no arrow's so he uses <em>darts</em>, (even though they are quite too<strong> short</strong>!). All of his shots land extremely<strong> short</strong>! (Picture Mr. Bean trying to shoot a dart and it landing<strong> short</strong>).	A<strong> short</strong> man can DART under the TABLE.	My<strong> short</strong> friend plays darts, but when he goes to pick them out, he has to climb up on the table we put next to the board.		
豊		bountiful	Bend . . . table. Think of a <b>bountiful</b> harvest, and you will not be far from the meaning of this character.		13	1551	1443	38	ホウ、ブ	ゆた.か、とよ	The<strong> bountiful</strong> feast was so<strong> bountiful</strong> that it <em>bent</em> the <em>table</em> below it under its weight! いただきま〜す！.	Her bust and bum was so<strong> bountiful</strong> I couldn't resist the urge to <em>bend</em> her over a nearby <em>table</em> and…	<em>Bender</em> stands on top of <em>Mr. Bean</em> to be able to reach the<strong> bountiful</strong> feast on the giant's table. (<em>Mr. Bean</em> didnt know how he even ended up there).	Be careful when people <em>bend</em> over around here: the <em>bean</em> harvest was<strong> bountiful</strong>.	Bender stands over the table,<strong> bountiful</strong>ly covered in loot.		
鼓		drum	The full kanji for the <i>drum</i> adds a <i>branch</i>, apparently to serve as a <b>drum</b>stick, to the primitive for <i>drum</i>.		13	1552	1444	38	コ	つづみ	"Japanese festivals have <strong>drums</strong> so big, a <em>samurai</em> has to SIT (not stand) on a <em>table</em> to beat one with a tree <em>branch</em>! <a href=""http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/"">http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/</a>~hidafyh/furukawayh/gyouji/image/maturi03.jpg."	"I really hate the primitive meaning of ""table"" for ""bean."" I just use ""bean."" Anyways, for the<strong> DRUM</strong> primitive, imagine a SAMURAI who beats on a<strong> DRUM</strong> with two chopsticks, and a BEAN skewered on each end of the chopstick to produce a better sound. And the obvious story is: ""DRUMing on a<strong> DRUM</strong> with a huge BRANCH""."	<em>Mr. Bean</em> tries to play<strong> drum</strong>s with <em>10</em> different <em>branches</em> he found on the ground.	These SAMURAI, sitting at the TABLE and waiting for their food, grab some BRANCHES to begin<strong> DRUM</strong>MING a rhythm while they wait. (In fact, they stand on the table, removing the top stroke!).	"A <em>drum</em> cannot<strong> drum</strong> without a stick. No stick? Use a <em>branch</em> instead. HINT: For<strong> drum</strong> primitive - Our samurai has eaten loads of beans and now his LOWER HALF (tummy full of beans) is bloated and stretched taut like a<strong> drum</strong>. We can see him tapping contentedly on his ""drum"". In Japanese folklore, tanuki are believed to play music by<strong> drum</strong>ming ""ponpoko pon no pon"" on their tummies."		
喜		rejoice	Drum . . . mouth.		12	1553	1445	38	キ	よろこ.ぶ、よろこ.ばす	The <em>samurai</em> sitting on the <em>drum</em> is on a stage, and the people below him are <strong>rejoicing</strong> with their <em>mouths</em> in unison. It helps me to imagine the placement this way.	<strong>Rejoice</strong> with the sound of <em>drums</em> and <em>voice</em>!	"In the taiko (<a href=""../v4/1444.html"">drum</a> (#1444 鼓)) song of rejoicing, the drummers shout with open mouths."	<em>Ten</em> <em>beans</em> in my <em>mouth</em>! I was starving so this small meal is enough for me to<strong> rejoice</strong>!	"Think Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Sir Robin's ministrals, following the group with their <em>drums</em>: ""One winter they had to eat (therefore the mouth) Robin's ministrals… and there was much <strong>rejoicing</strong>."		
樹		timber-trees	Trees . . . drum . . . glue.		16	1554	1446	38	ジュ	き	The hippies object to trees being cut down for timber. They have glued themselves to the<strong> timber-trees</strong> and are beating their drums.	"To the cutting down of<strong> timber-trees</strong> and the destruction of the forest, the hippies have staged a protest demonstration using a <em>drum</em> in the <em>middle of the town</em> (see <a href=""../v4/208.html"">town</a> (#208 村))."	"Everyone likes to see big trees fall down. For this kanji imagine hundreds of spectators <em>glue</em>d to their chairs, then a <em>drum</em> roll and then a cry of ""timber!!!"" as the huge <em>tree</em> crashes to the ground."	<em>Drums</em> are made from<strong> timber-trees</strong> cut down and <em>glued</em> together. (they really are).	Trivia: 尌 (drum+glue) is a rare kanji wih a meaning <em>standing (something) up</em>. Story: Trees that were set to stand up (and grow) at certain places are<strong> timber-trees</strong>. 樹立 【じゅりつ】 (n,vs) establish; create;.		
皿		dish	The kanji for a <b>dish</b> is, clearly, the pictograph of a painted or carved bowl, seen from the side.		5	1555	1447	38	ベイ	さら	Three<strong> dish</strong>es stacked side-by-side in a<strong> dish</strong>washer.	Pictograph of a<strong> dish</strong> with a three-layer cake slice on it.	3<strong> dish</strong>es in a<strong> dish</strong> rack. HINT: To avoid making 4<strong> dish</strong>es, remember that '4' is an unlucky number in Japan so things are rarely in sets of 4.	The Holy Grail.	I eat fast, so all my<strong> dish</strong>es have racing stripes like this one.		
血		blood	The <i>drop</i> in the <i>dish</i> is <b>blood</b>. It is similar to the <i>drop</i> we saw earlier on the <i>dagger</i> in the character for <i>blade</i> (Frame 88).		6	1556	1448	38	ケツ	ち	Vampire orders<strong> blood</strong> in one of those posh restaurants. Imagine his shock when all he gets is a giant white bowl and just a single drop of<strong> blood</strong> in the centre and a drizzling of balsamic around the edge. Disgusted he calls the manager over tells him its overpriced tosh and bites into his neck with a huge gush of<strong> blood</strong> spraying everywhere.	You cut yourself washing the dishes, drop of<strong> blood</strong>.	Image: <em>Holy Grail</em> with a <em>drop</em> of Jesus<strong> blood</strong> on it.	People used to think that<strong> blood</strong>letting was an effective treatment for many illnesses. The doctor would cut the patient's arm open and let the <em>drops</em> of<strong> blood</strong> fall into a <em>dish</em>.	<strong>BLOOD</strong>?! IS that a SPOT of<strong> BLOOD</strong> on my PLATE!?! asks the infuriated vegetarian when he ordered a salad at a restaurant.		
盆		basin	Part . . . dish.		9	1557	1449	38	ボン		The <em>part</em> of the kitchen sink in which you wash <em>dishes</em> in is the<strong> basin</strong>.	Your mom yells at you to stop throwing dishes in the<strong> basin</strong>. She lifts up (to show primitive order) the broken parts to show you the damage you've done.	If you break a coconut in two <em>parts</em>, you can improvise a kachi-kachi (a kind of castanet that is played at <strong>bon festivals</strong>). After the festival is done you can use them as a curved <em>dish</em>, a <strong>basin</strong> (synonym of bowl).	When the god parted his soup dish in two it created a huge<strong> basin</strong>.	It will take just a minute to wash the<strong> basin</strong>'s dishes.		
盟		alliance	Bright . . . dish.		13	1558	1450	38	メイ		"(re: Raichu) An undercover<strong> alliance</strong> between Japan (the <em>sun</em> on its flag) and Turkey (the <em>moon</em> on its flag) detected by a surveillance satellite <em>dish</em>. <a href=""http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100126a3.html"">http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100126a3.html</a>."	"A new<strong> alliance</strong> is proclaimed at the end of a meal between officials. As a symbol of their<strong> alliance</strong> they clean up together one <em>dish</em>, and present it to the photographers. The clean dish under the flash lights appears very <em>bright</em>, and it's pretty much all you can see on the photo that appears on the next morning's newspapers, with the title ""New<strong> alliance</strong>, one <em>bright dish</em>!""."	The <em>bright dishes</em> in the cupboard form an<strong> alliance</strong> against the others.	In medieval Japan (during Sengoku Jidai) there was an interesting ritual to form an<strong> alliance</strong> between different samurai clans. The warlord, who wanted to propose to form an<strong> alliance</strong> to another warlord, would send him a big ceremonial <em>dish</em> with the <em>sun</em> drawn in the center. If the proposal were accepted, the second warlord would draw an image of the <em>moon</em> next to the <em>sun</em> on the same <em>dish</em>, and then return the <em>dish</em> to the first warlord. (not true story, but helped me to create vivid image).	The <strong>alliance</strong> has built <em>bright</em> satellite <em>dish</em>es to defeat the rebels.		
盗		steal	Next . . . dish.		11	1559	1451	38	トウ	ぬす.む、ぬす.み	You are so poor you dont know where your <em>next dish</em> will come from all you know is that you will have to<strong> steal</strong> it.	The first thing to<strong> steal</strong> is the silverware; <em>next</em>, the <em>dishes</em>.	You're at a revolving sushi restaurant with a famous thief, who's so slick he says he can<strong> steal</strong> anything without anyone noticing. OK, you say, the NEXT DISH that comes by,<strong> steal</strong> it…	This is pretty easy: While he's not looking, imagine<strong> steal</strong>ing food from the dish next to you!	"The <em>next</em> thing on his list of things to<strong> steal</strong> after the <em>dishes</em> was the kitchen sink. Watch out for <a href=""../v4/357.html"">burglar</a> (#357 賊) and <a href=""../v4/566.html"">rob</a> (#566 奪) and <a href=""../v4/1414.html"">crime</a> (#1414 犯). To differentiate it, think that<strong> steal</strong>ing is arbitrary (hence the kitchen sink), <a href=""../v4/566.html"">rob</a> (#566 奪) is more deliberate (and hence the protection of the attack turkey) and <a href=""../v4/357.html"">burglar</a> (#357 賊) is the most professional of them all (it is his full time job), so he knows when to hit (when everyone is at the fiesta)."		
温		warm	Water . . . sun . . . dish.		12	1560	1452	38	オン	あたた.か、あたた.かい、あたた.まる、あたた.める、ぬく	If you leave <strong>water</strong> out in the <strong>sun</strong> in a <strong>dish</strong>, naturally it will get <em>warm</em>.	"I'm mixing this up with <a href=""../v4/1949.html"">warmth</a> (#1949 暖) far too much. Trying to use mnemonic ""Warm Water"" - 温泉 （おんせん） obviously relates to <em>water</em> that is<strong> warm</strong>, from the <em>sun</em> and when you think about it, is kind of like a big <em>dish</em>."	I ate the <em>sun</em> on a <em>plate</em>, and I now feel<strong> warm</strong> inside. I had to drink <em>water</em> to stop this burning.	To<strong> warm</strong> <em>water</em>, leave it in a <em>dish</em> in the afternoon <em>sun</em>.	The<strong> warm</strong> water,<strong> warm</strong> sun, and<strong> warm</strong> dish: the three best things to keep you<strong> warm</strong>.		
蓋		lid	Flowers . . . gone . . . dish.		14	1561	2388	38	ガイ、カイ、コウ	ふた、けだ.し、おお.う、かさ、かこう	The<strong> lid</strong> of this <em>dish</em> is <em>gone</em>! Now the whole room smells of the <em>flowers</em> that were used in the cooking.	The magic<strong> lid</strong> trick: you put flowers in the dish and cover them up with the<strong> lid</strong>. Then you lift and the flowers are gone!	The waiter of a fancy restaurant takes the<strong> lid</strong> away and what you see is - nothing! The food is <em>gone</em> - somebody has stolen it. All what has been left from the <em>dish</em> is the decoration, a single <em>flower</em>…	"You're tunelessly singing, ""Where have all the <em>flowers gone</em>? Gone to <em>dishes</em> every one…"", and someone shouts, ""Put a<strong> lid</strong> on it!""."	When the magician lifted the<strong> LID</strong>, the <em>flowers</em> were <em>gone</em> from the <em>dish</em>.		
監		oversee	Slaves . . . reclining . . . floor/one . . . dish.		15	1562	1453	38	カン		The slavetrader <strong>oversees</strong> the slaves washing <em>dishes</em> int he kitchen. No <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em>!	"The <em>slaves</em> are <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> when the<strong> oversee</strong>r comes in. They tell him ""We're not goofing off, a <em>dish</em> fell and broke and we're cleaning it off the <em>floor</em>""."	"While the slave-buyer is perusing (<a href=""../v4/855.html"">perusal</a> (#855 覧)) the stack of <strong>slaves reclining on the floor</strong>, the slaves'<strong> oversee</strong>r supplies them with <strong>dishes</strong> of gruel – don't want the slaves starving to death before they can be sold!"	"Mnemonic : ""The<strong> oversee</strong>r<strong> oversee</strong>s that the <em>slaves</em> are washing the <em>dishes</em> instead of <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> (having a siesta)""."	The plantation master<strong> oversee</strong>s his slaves crawling on the floor and eating from the same plate.		
濫		overflow	Water . . . oversee.		18	1563	1454	38	ラン	みだ.りに、みだ.りがましい	Who's job is it to oversee the water level on the dam? It'ts<strong> overflow</strong>ing!	The <em>overseer</em> isn't doing his job and he lets the slaves <strong>overflow</strong> the sink!	When <em>water</em><strong> overflow</strong>s it is usually because someone was not properly <em>overseeing</em> the task. Image: A mother talking on the phone, <em>overseeing</em> the drawing her kid's bath, boiling something on the stove, and breaking up a fight between two of the kids. Something is bound to<strong> overflow</strong>.	This is the <em>overseer</em> from the previous kanji, who was watching the slave wash the dishes. Unfortunately, the reclining <em>overseer</em> fell asleep and didn't notice when the <em>water</em> starting<strong> overflow</strong>ing from the sink. ……………………………………………………………………. An alternate version of this story would be the famous scene from Fantasia where Mickey falls asleep and stops <em>overseeing</em> the brooms bringing in <em>water</em>, so the room<strong> overflow</strong>s.	Water will<strong> overflow</strong>… if you do not oversee.		
鑑		specimen	Metal . . . oversee.		23	1564	1455	38	カン	かんが.みる、かがみ	The <em>overseer</em> tags his slaves with <em>gold</em> earrings, just like <strong>specimens</strong>.	(Thanks bodhisamaya) The authorities are suspicious about the athlete that won GOLD at the olympics. They are now OVERSEEING a thorough drug test, taking all sorts of<strong> SPECIMEN</strong>S.	Professor Hojo OVERSEEs his<strong> SPECIMEN</strong>S in their METAL tanks.	"The <em>overseer</em> tags his favorite slave with <em>gold</em> earrings. ""Ah, what a fine<strong> specimen</strong>!""."	The overseer demands a golden shower into the<strong> specimen</strong> jar.		
藍		indigo	Flowers . . . oversee.		18	1565	2371	38	ラン	あい	<strong>Indigo</strong> <em>flowers</em> have to be <em>overseen</em> because they are often picked for their beauty.	"Traditionally, 青 <a href=""../v4/1534.html"">blue</a> (#1534 青) could be used to describe blue OR green. However, two kanji that describe the hues specifically are 藍 and 緑 . This kanji is the ""blue"" counterpart of <a href=""../v4/1371.html"">green</a> (#1371 緑). Story: The <em>overseer</em>, master of the slaves, wore a cloak dyed with<strong> indigo</strong>, and <em>flowers</em> in his hair."	"<a href=""Http://gaijinsmashnet.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/1-kyuu/"">Http://gaijinsmashnet.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/1-kyuu/</a> Reading this rant by a non-RTKer mentioning this particular kanji made me remember it very well."	<strong>Indigo</strong> <em>flowers</em> have to be closely <em>overseen</em> during the growing process, otherwise they'll be useless for making <strong>indigo</strong> dye.	The princess who likes to <em>oversee</em> the making of her dishes, often wears<strong> indigo</strong> coloured clothes.<strong> Indigo</strong> is made from <em>flowers</em>.		
猛		fierce	Wild dogs . . . child . . . dish.		11	1566	1456	38	モウ		The<strong> fierce</strong> WILD DOG attacked the CHILD who came near his feeding DISH.	I picture a<strong> fierce</strong> little fat kid, defending his dish of food from a pack of dogs.	If you want to make your wild dogs<strong> fierce</strong>, feed them a child. Children are the holy grail of dogfood you know…	If you want to make your wild dogs<strong> fierce</strong>, put a child in their dish.	Ok, I'll bring in a 300 reference. A<strong> FIERCE</strong> pack of WILD DOGS fight an even<strong> FIERCE</strong>R spartan CHILD over the food left on the PLATE. The CHILD won and was declared king.		
盛		boom	Here <b>boom</b> refers to something that is popular and prospering. Its elements: <i>turn into</i> . . . <i>dish</i>.		11	1567	1457	38	セイ、ジョウ	も.る、さか.る、さか.ん	Japan's economic<strong> boom</strong> turned their empty plates into full ones.	The<strong> boom</strong> of satellite TV has made antennas <em>turn into</em> <em>dishes</em>.	The Chinese kitchen is famous for knowing how to <em>turn</em> anything slightly edible <em>into</em> a good <em>dish</em>. That's one of the reasons why their cuisine<strong> boom</strong>ed all over the world.	"Yoshinoya is enjoying a popularity <strong>boom</strong> because of the promotion where all their <em>dish</em>es are <em>turned into</em> 大 <strong>盛</strong>り sized <em>dish</em>es at no extra charge. [おおもり, ""a large serving""]."	The Japanese have a phrase, マイブーム (my<strong> boom</strong>), which refers to something that a person is currently obsessed with or fascinated by. This kanji depicts the<strong> boom</strong> as a certain <em>dish</em> that has just <em>turned into</em> a national trend.		
塩		salt	Ground . . . reclining . . . mouth . . . dish.		13	1568	1458	38	エン	しお	In the old days,<strong> salt</strong> was a worth alot, so it is not surprising to find someone <em>reclining</em> on the <em>ground</em>, <em>mouth</em> to <em>plate</em>, getting every last grain of that delicious<strong> salt</strong>.	"Remember the mock sushi documentary that circulated a while ago: ""Because some feel that the shoyu was not<strong> salt</strong>y enough, complementary<strong> salt</strong> dishes are provided on the ground outside the sushiya, you can recline and put as much as you desire in your mouth""."	It is bad luck to spill<strong> salt</strong> on the <em>ground</em>, so you better <em>recline</em> and lick it into your <em>mouth</em> or put it back on the <em>dish</em>.	This is a picture of an artificial<strong> salt</strong> lick on the <em>grounds</em> of a nature preserve: animals can go there, <em>recline</em>, and use their <em>mouths</em> to lick the<strong> salt</strong> from a <em>dish</em>.	"In a<strong> SALT</strong> pan, all the <strong>soil</strong> is actually<strong> SALT</strong>.

銀		silver	Metal . . . silver.		14	1569	1459	38	ギン	しろがね	Like <em>gold</em>, <em>silver</em> is a <em>metal</em>.	"Not sure why Heisig find the right side so troublesome. My grandma's <em>hairpin</em> (just before <a href=""../v4/1920.html"">long</a> (#1920 長)) is made of<strong> silver</strong>, the metal that best reflects <em>sun</em> light. I'm sure you can see the flash from her hair as she walks by on a sunny day. Note that the two elements (<em>sun</em> and <em>hairpin</em>) share not only a horizontal stroke, but also the left vertical one. Therefore a bit odd stroke order."	<em>Metal</em> that is<strong> silver</strong> is<strong> silver</strong>!	"<strong>Silver</strong> is almost as <a href=""../v4/1468.html"">good</a> (#1468 良) as gold, but not quite (one stroke missing)."	In order of value, it goes: <em>gold</em>, then <em><strong>silver</strong></em>.		
恨		resentment	State of mind . . . silver.		9	1570	1460	38	コン	うら.む、うら.めしい	The athlete's <em>state of mind</em> is nothing but<strong> resentment</strong> after getting the <em>silver</em> medal.	<em>Data</em>'s greatest <strong>resentment</strong> is getting a <em>silver</em> medal in Science Olympiad. (Image: <em>Data</em> fuming on the podium muttering about being half robot).	What is your state of mind when you win silver? You resent that you didn't win gold!	<strong>Regret</strong> at missing the gold means a silver medalist's state of mind =<strong> resentment</strong> [True phenomenon: bronze medalists are happier than silver because they are just glad that they medalled at all.].	Data felt<strong> resentment</strong> toward the Silver Surfer for being able to fly through space freely while he was always trapped on the Enterprise with Picard and Riker doing dumb missions.		
根		root	Tree . . . silver.		10	1571	1461	38	コン	ね、-ね	Since trees eat through their<strong> root</strong>s, one could imagine<strong> root</strong>s as <em>tree silver</em>ware.	The <strong>root</strong>s of the magical <em>tree</em> are <em>silver</em>.	In the kanji for<strong> root</strong> (not the primitive), I imagine a <em>tree</em> whose<strong> root</strong>s end up in <em>silverware</em>, which the <em>tree</em> uses somehow to eat whatever is underground.	Think of how if you look at the<strong> root</strong>s of many trees, they are not brown like the rest of the trunk, they sometimes are a whitish, silver color, because they are full of water and nutrients, rather than course cellulose like what is needed up top to protect from the elements.	The <em>tree</em> with <em>silver</em> on it (the Christmas tree) has NO<strong> root</strong>s.		
即		instant	Silver . . . stamp.		7	1572	1462	38	ソク	つ.く、つ.ける、すなわ.ち	He scratches off the <em>silver</em> <em>stamp</em> and discovers that he is an<strong> instant</strong> winner.	For<strong> instant</strong> postal delivery, buy a <em>silver</em> <em>stamp</em>!	Hint:<strong> Instant</strong> cameras. In photography it only takes an<strong> instant</strong> for the light to reach the <em>silver</em> nitrate on the film and <em>stamp</em> an image on it.	<strong>Instant</strong> ramen always has <em>silver</em> foil <em>stamp</em>ed on the top of the cup, as a lid.

A <em>vulture</em> took the<strong> baron</strong>'s <em>eye</em>, so he <em>glued</em> a <em>silver</em> one in its place.	During the first world war there was a german fighter pilot knicknamed the red<strong> baron</strong> (von Richthofen). He was like a <em>vulture</em>, coming from above you see a huge red <em>eye</em> painted on the plane's wings, you see the glint of his many silver medals as he glues himself to your tail, he sights and shoots… pow pow pow the bullets wizz by, soon it will all be over. (it it helps von Richthofen had <em>silver</em> cups engraved for every 'kill' he made).	Yes, it is I, the venerable<strong> Baron</strong> <em>Vultureye</em> von <em>Silverglue</em>!

In the land of Oz, you advance by following the golden road, but you reatreat by following the <em>Silver Road</em>.	"In Spanish there is a saying which is useful to remember this kanji. It says: ""A enemigo que huye, puente de plata,"" which translates literally as ""To enemy that<strong> retreat</strong>s, silver bridge,"" meaning one should not stay in the way of a<strong> retreat</strong>ing enemy. In the kanji we just replace the silver bridge by a <em>silver</em> <em>road</em>."

At <em>The Pinnacle</em>, they<strong> limit</strong> how much <em>silver</em> you can have. Too much silver will lead to wrongfulness.	Not just anyone can gain membership into The Pinnacle, it<strong> limit</strong>s its membership to those with the appropriate amount of silver, both to be used as cash and weaponry in their war against the werewolves. (Mnemonic: Pinnacle<strong> limit</strong>s membership to those with enough silver.).	"I'll elaborate on dingomick's story to highlight the importance of ""silver"" in this story so as not to forget. The speed<strong> limit</strong> at The Pinnacle is posted on silver signs… why do you think they are silver? If you remember the top story from <a href=""../v4/1459.html"">silver</a> (#1459 銀), you know that silver is the metal that reflects the most light and therefore draws a lot of attention to it.

食		eat	"If <i>halo</i> and <i>umbrella</i> aren't enough, break the <i>halo</i> down into <i>drop</i> and <i>silver</i> - or ""silverware,"" an additional primitive."	* As a primitive, this kanji can mean either <i>eating</i> or <i>food</i>.

"Note : as a primitive I use the image of a hamburger, or ""fast food""."		
飯		meal	Food . . . anti-.		12	1583	1473	38	ハン	めし	I'm <em>anti</em>-fast<em>food</em>. Sit down and eat a real<strong> meal</strong>!	I'm <em>Anti-</em>McDonald's. <em>Anti-</em>Happy <strong>Meal</strong>. <em>Anti-hamburger</em>.

飲		drink	Food . . . yawn.		12	1584	1474	38	イン、オン	の.む、-の.み	When you <em>lack food</em>, just<strong> drink</strong> something to fill you up.	In Japan, the one thing I always seem to be <em>lacking</em> with my <em>food</em> is a properer sized<strong> drink</strong>. Instead I have to<strong> drink</strong> that shot glass of water.	Always the same in those restaurants. You've already received your<strong> drink</strong> and you're waiting so long for your <em>food</em> that you begin to <em>yawn</em>.	VERY easy! Food alone is never enough - without a<strong> drink</strong>, our meal would be lacking! After all, food lacks the water that we get from<strong> drink</strong>ing.

飢		hungry	Food . . . wind.		10	1585	1475	38	キ	う.える	The smell of cooked <em>food</em> wafts past you in the <em>wind</em>, making your stomach rumble and feeling<strong> hungry</strong>.	The <em>wind</em> blew away my <em>food</em>, so now I'm<strong> hungry</strong>.

A group of high class chefs were trapped in a fast food restaurant. They had such a big ego, they refused to eat any hamburgers, and they all<strong> starve</strong>d to death.	"People use the phrase ""I'm starving"" too casually. They just want some FOOD, and their EGO causes them to magnify their terminology for effect.

飾		decorate	Food . . . reclining . . . towel.		13	1587	1477	38	ショク	かざ.る、かざ.り	[decorate; ornament; adorn; embellish] We <strong>decorate</strong> a table before <em>eating</em>, <em>reclining</em> a <em>towel</em> over it.

You<strong> decorate</strong> your house with pictures of you reclining in a towel surrounded by food.	Hint: a fancy picnic.		
餌		feed	<i>Food</i> . . . <i>ear</i>.

Do you know Mike Tayson favorite<strong> feed</strong>? Ears! He eats ears!

Pavlov's dog knew that<strong> FEED</strong> had been set out for him to EAT whenever his EARS heard the bell.	<strong>Feed</strong> him until the FOOD comes out of his EARS.		
館		Bldg.	The abbreviation of <b>Building</b> suggests that this kanji is used in proper names, as indeed it often is. Keep your connotation distinct from <i>Inst.</i> (Frame 1401) when working with the elements: <i>food</i> . . . <i>bureaucrat</i>.		16	1589	1478	38	カン	やかた、たて	A <strong>building</strong> that <em>eats</em> <em>bureaucrats</em>!!!!!!!!	This<strong> Bldg.</strong> is like all the other government buildings - they house <em>bureaucrats</em> who sit around sipping wine and <em>eating</em> expensive meals at the taxpayers expense.	The <em>bureaucrat</em> never goes out for lunch, always choosing to <em>eat</em> in the<strong> Bldg.</strong>	"Empire State <strong>Building</strong> (to avoid confusing with <a href=""../v4/591.html"">government office</a> (#591 庁) and <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1304"">Inst.</a> (#1304 院)). <em>McDonalds</em> lobbies the <em>bureaucrats</em> by treating them to a lavish feast at the top of the Empire State <strong>Building</strong>."

I will <em>puzzle</em> over the content of our conversation for some time to come."	<strong>Mochi</strong> is like a <em>puzzle</em> you <em>eat</em> and solve in your mouth lest you choke.	<strong>Mochi</strong> ice cream is a puzzling food, I still have no idea how they get that ice cream in there, but it sure tastes good.	<strong>MOCHI</strong> is so difficult to EAT, it's a PUZZLE to me why people eat it.	As a promotion, a<strong> MOCHI</strong> manufacturer starts making them as pieces of a jigsaw. Now kids want to buy them not to eat them, but to solve the week's <em>FOOD PUZZLE</em>!		
養		foster	<i>Sheep</i> . . . <i>food</i>. The key word has the sense of promoting the development of something, especially in a psychological or spiritual sense.		15	1591	1479	38	ヨウ、リョウ	やしな.う	A sheep became the<strong> foster</strong> parent for a wolf pup, feeding it with milk. This story cannot end well…	"You<strong> foster</strong> (""promote the growth of"") your sheep well when they have food right at their feet."	"Judy<strong> Foster</strong> in ""The Silence of the <em>Lamb</em>s"" is what Dr. Hannibal-the cannibal-Lecter would like to <em>eat</em>."	<strong>Foster</strong> a <em>sheep</em> today!

You go to a all you can eat steak house and eat FOOD until you are TIRED of it /<strong> Sated</strong>. Then you ask for them to WRAP up the left-overs so you can take them home.	I was<strong> sated</strong>, so I <em>wrapped</em> up the rest of my <em>food</em> in a doggy bag to take home.	I wonder why my book has a 金 instead of a 食 there.. strange.		
既		previously	<i>Silver</i> . . . <i>waitress</i>. Do not confuse this kanji's key word with <i>before</i> (Frame 263).		10	1593	1481	38	キ	すで.に	"Distinguish from <a href=""../v4/501.html"">formerly</a> (#501 曽). Think of<strong> previously</strong> as ""the previous customer"" in a restaurant. At a cheap sleazy diner, the <em>waitress</em> gives you unwashed <em>silver</em>ware that was<strong> previously</strong> used by the previous customer. Yuck."	For the waitress primitive, I don't really see the receipt. So instead, I imagine a waitress holding a plate above her head, using those legs to weave through the tables.	<strong>Previously</strong> on The Silver Surfer. The Silver Surfer took the <em>Silver Waitress</em> back to his place. Now we get to see what happens next.	<strong>Previously</strong> -> <strong>previews</strong> at the movies. Almost all the actresses on the <em>silver</em> screen<strong> previously</strong> were <em>waitresses</em>. Story by mspertus.	<strong>Previously</strong>, we left some <em>silver</em> on the table for the <em>waitress</em>.		
概		outline	<i>Roots</i> . . . <i>waitress</i>. Note that the kanji meaning of the two primitives to the right is not used here because we shall later meet a primitive meaning <i>beforehand</i> and want to preempt any confusion. The same holds true in the following frame.		14	1594	1482	38	ガイ	おうむ.ね	A murder has been commited. A corpse was found under a <em>tree</em>. The police chalks the<strong> outline</strong> of the victim, an old <em>silvered</em>-haired <em>waitress</em> working at a restaurant nearby.	If you attempted to<strong> outline</strong> the biography of most famous actresses, you'd find that they have <em>roots</em> working as <em>waitresses</em> before getting their big break.	"If you look at the<strong> outline</strong> (resume/CV) of any professional woman, you'll probably find that while a student she was a <em>waitress</em> part-time so that she could pay the bills, so you could say that most professional women have their ""roots"" in being a <em>waitress</em>."	The chalk<strong> OUTLINE</strong> of a murdered TREE. It was hit by a car and crashed to the ground. All that remains now is a chalk<strong> OUTLINE</strong> where the TREE was PREVIOUSLY laying dead, before being thrown into the chipper.	Some restaurants use <em>wooden</em> signs to<strong> outline</strong> the amount of <em>silver</em> one should leave for the <em>waitress</em>.		
慨		rue	Resentment . . . waitress.		13	1595	1483	38	ガイ		If you don't leave some <em>silver</em> as a tip, you will<strong> rue</strong> the day you earned the <em>resentment</em> of your <em>waitress</em>.	The <em>resentment</em> of a <em>waitress</em> who gave up going to college to help her boyfriend (with his tuition). She<strong> rue</strong>s that decision ever since she got dumped by him (just after he graduated).	<em>Data</em> is angry…he gave all his <em>silver</em> to the lady who was supposedly his <em>waitress</em>. She ran out the door and left him with no money to pay the bill! He shouts, 'You will<strong> rue</strong> the day you stole my silver!'.	State of mind + Previously: To<strong> rue</strong> something is to let your <em>state of mind</em> be ruled by whatever <em>previously</em> happened.	I'm English so when I go to Paris, they really <em>resent</em> me. Sitting in a cafe on any<strong> rue</strong>, I can see the <em>resentment</em> in the <em>waitresses'</em> faces. After what they do to my food, I<strong> rue</strong> eating there! [after gorgon].		
平		even	This character is easiest remembered as a pictograph of a water lily floating on the surface of the water, which gives it its meaning of <b>even</b>. The fourth stroke represents the calm, smooth surface of a pond, and the final stroke the long stem of the plant reaching underwater.	* As a primitive, this kanji can keep its pictographic meaning of a <i>water lily</i>.	5	1596	1484	39	ヘイ、ビョウ、ヒョウ	たい.ら、-だいら、ひら、ひら-	There's an<strong> even</strong> covering of <em>water lilies</em> on the pond at 金閣寺 （きんかくじ） the Golden Pavilion in Kyoto.	<strong>Even</strong> if Heisig showed me in person, I still wouldn't believe that this is a <em>water lily</em>. I don't get it.	The graph of an<strong> even</strong> function [f(x)] will be symmetrical over the y-axis, as this kanji appears to be.	If you take scissors and cut off the upper part of its primitive and then close your scissors, you get an<strong> even</strong> kanji.	"This is<strong> even</strong> as in flat, level, smooth, calm (not like ""even if"" or ""even though"")."		
呼		call	"<i>Mouth</i> . . . <i>water lily</i>. Note: this is the one time that the ""stem"" has a barb at the end. Work this fact into your story."		8	1597	1485	39	コ	よ.ぶ	I'm a lazy fisher, so I genetically engineered a <em>lily pad</em> with a <em>fishing hook at the stem</em> and a <em>mouth</em> to<strong> call</strong> me whenever it catches something.	I just follow the <strong>calls</strong> from the frogs <em>mouths</em> on the <em>lily pads</em> to <em>hook</em> them.	The right portion of this character isn't a water lily at all; we will take it to be a <em>broken hand</em> (see how if you rotate the second and third strokes, you approach the appearance of the character for hand?). In this character, we see someone who is trapped with a <em>broken hand</em> opening their <em>mouth</em> to<strong> call</strong> for help.	"Inspired by dingomick: 'Budd' - 'weis' - 'er'<strong> call</strong> the frogs <em>mouths</em> from the <em>liliy pads</em>, working to get you <em>hooked</em> on beer. <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=f3mXaATLeRM"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f3mXaATLeRM</a>."	Not really <em>even</em> and first and last strokes are a different stroke type. Frog with open <em>mouth</em><strong> call</strong>ing out as he slips off the <em>water-lily, bending it out of shape</em>.		
坪		two-mat area	This kanji belongs to an old Japanese system of measurement and indicates an area of about 36 square feet, or the <b>area</b> taken up by <b>two</b> tatami <b>mats</b>. Its elements: <i>ground</i> . . . <i>water lily</i>.		8	1598	1486	39	ヘイ	つぼ	A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is just about as much <em>ground</em> as you will need for a <em>lily</em> pond.	A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is plenty of space for sleeping in a tent but you won't be comfortable unless the <em>ground</em> is <em>even</em>.	A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is exactly how much ground a giant lilypad will cover.	Place the two mats on the <em>ground</em> <em>even</em>ly to get a<strong> two-mat area</strong>.	Since one full tatami mat's length is twice as long as its width, a two mat area would create an even, square floorspace: a somewhat more convenient unit of measuring the ground.		
評		evaluate	Words . . . water lily.		12	1599	1487	39	ヒョウ		Good <strong>evaluation</strong> should always be <em>words</em> of <em>even</em> fairness.	You get an <strong>evaluation</strong> copy of MS <em>Word</em> because you want to <strong>evaluate</strong> whether it's worth buying the full version. At the end of the <strong>evaluation</strong> period the CD turns into a <em>lily</em>pad so you can't use it any more (an innovative new copy-protection trick).	Gardeners have developed many <em>words</em> to<strong> evaluate</strong> the health of <em>lilies</em>.	The first time I delivered a speech in japanese it was a mess! The juries (it was contest)<strong> Evaluate</strong>d me and gave me a bad score because the Words were not said in an Even tone. I guess I was too nervous (true story).	<em>Words</em> have to come out in an <em>even</em> tone during a Japanese speaking test, otherwise your <strong>evalutation</strong> will have bad <strong>comments</strong> written all over it, resulting in <strong>criticism</strong> from your teacher. He your (ひょう) teacher though, so it's his fault! NOTE: This kanji also means 'comment' & 'criticism'.		
刈		reap	Sheaf . . . saber.		4	1600	1488	39	ガイ、カイ	か.る	Sheaf? No. This is the sign of the X-Men. I'm going with Wolverine on this one..

The kendo artist takes a brief<strong> moment</strong> to practice his skills: he throws <em>sheafs</em> over the <em>tree</em> and tries to cut them with his <em>saber</em> when they come down again.	Wtf<strong> moment</strong>? This kanji means temple. Wooden x-men statues with sabres guard the entrance to the Professor Xavier temple. Might help if you imagine the two x-men as Wolverine and Sabretooth.	"You pray in a <strong>temple</strong> (see herman) when you suddenly hear the sound of cracking <em>wood</em>.

"<em>Death</em> (I use Terry Pratchett's <em>Death</em> as a primitive for <a href=""../v4/1488.html"">reap</a> (#1488 刈), <a href=""../v4/1489.html"">hope</a> (#1489 希), <a href=""../v4/1493.html"">kill</a> (#1493 殺), <a href=""../v4/1696.html"">ward</a> (#1696 区)) uses a sword ( 刈 ) on kings, a scythe on ordinary folk, and a <em>shovel</em> on <strong>villains</strong>."		
胸		bosom	Part of the body . . . bound up . . . villain.		10	1604	1491	39	キョウ	むね、むな-	<strong>Bosom</strong> is a Flesh part that should be bound up lest it provoke villian thoughts.	As you know, female comics <em>villains</em> are always <em>binding</em> the <em>flesh</em> of their<strong> bosom</strong> <em>up</em> in interesting ways. One has to wonder how these clothes stay on their body at all…	Just think of the heroine's <strong>bosom</strong> in a movie. The <em>villain</em> <em>ties up</em> the heroine (to the traintracks or the conveyor belt etc) but her <strong>bosom</strong> is the <em>body part</em> that is always left sticking out.	Here's an easy way to defeat the bad guy: have Wonder Woman do topless jumping jacks and quickly <em>bind up the villain</em> while he ogles the most seductive <em>part of her body</em>—her<strong> bosom</strong>.	In Japanese lyrics, 胸 often refers to one's heart, one's soul. It is the part of one's body (metaphorically speaking) which wraps, according to Christian theology, our evil ways.		
離		detach	"<i>Top hat</i> . . . <i>villain</i> . . . <i>belt</i> . . . <i>elbow</i> . . . <i>turkey</i>. This is potentially one of the most difficult characters to remember.

Finally, I'm about to fight him. But what's this? He's suspiciously quiet. I move to attack him, and his right arm falls off at the <em>elbow</em>. Strange. I walk up to him and<strong> detach</strong> his left arm. Very strange. I undo his <em>belt</em>, and take off his <em>top hat</em>… BLAST! It was just a decoy <em>turkey</em>!	The most ridiculous character ever dreamt up for a film.<strong> DETACH</strong>O, a top-hat wearing villian who is able to<strong> detach</strong> his body parts for use as weapons. His most powerful weapons are his elbows, which he can<strong> detach</strong>, tie together with his belt and use as nunchucks.<strong> DETACH</strong>O has a sidekick turkey which he uses as an advanced scout as well.	I'm surprised no one has worked Oddjob, the <em>villain</em> from the James Bond movie, Goldfinger into their stories. He's the big oriental guy that killed people by throwing his <em>top hat</em> at them. He practises his technique on turkeys,<strong> detach</strong>ing their heads in the process. Being an assassin, he can also kill people by garroting them with his <em>belt</em> or smashing them with his <em>elbows</em>.	"As for the left element - 离 - i think it'd be interesting to read the following wiki-article <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_</a>(mythology). This is <em>chi</em> (in this case <em>ri</em>) - mythological hornless dragon or <em>wyvern</em>. Best to remember it as a primitive, because it appears in a number of rare kanji: 禽 (2049); 璃 (2048); 檎 (2050);擒. Though Heisig defined this element as <em>sheik</em> in RTK3, this is completely arbitrary."	This <em>turkey</em> is a <em>top hat</em>-wearing <em>villain</em>, and he keeps his own <em>elbows</em> in his <em>belt</em>, gunslinger style, ready to<strong> detach</strong> them and throw them one after another like boomerangs when necessary.		
璃		crystal	This kanji refers to one of the seven classical stones of China. Its elements: <i>jewel</i> . . . <i>top hat</i> . . . <i>villain</i> . . . <i>belt</i> . . . <i>elbow</i>.		14	1606	2048	39	リ		The <em>King</em>'s<strong> crystal</strong> got <em>detached</em> from his royal throne, and is missing! Looks like the turkey got away with it. He's no where to be seen!	"In my story for detatch <a href=""../v4/1492.html"">detach</a> (#1492 離), the left side primitive was <em>junkie</em>. The top-hatted villian of society with a belt around their elbow. Here, the <em>junkie</em> is getting a fix of<strong> crystal</strong> meth: the <em>jewel</em> in the crown of today's drugs."	"<em>Michael Jackson</em> is the <em>king</em> of pop, wearing his<strong> crystal</strong> rhinestone glove (see <a href=""../v4/1492.html"">detach</a> (#1492 離)."	Primitive: <em>Sheik</em> is too vague for me. How about Prince Ali, Aladdin dressed up like a sheik to impress Princess Jasmine? I'll use Aladdin or Prince Ali for this primitive, whichever works best in a story. Story: Prince Ali holds up a large<strong> crystal</strong> <em>jewel</em> to impress Princess Jasmine. She looks quite bored, but the Sultan looks thrilled!	When Oddjob ran out of shoes to throw he tossed a<strong> crystal</strong> ball.		
殺		kill	Sheaf . . . tree . . . missile.		10	1607	1493	39	サツ、サイ、セツ	ころ.す、-ごろ.し、そ.ぐ	"Wolverine (sheaf, see <a href=""../v4/1488.html"">reap</a> (#1488 刈)) leaps over a tree and with one swipe of his claws<strong> kill</strong>s a bad guy aiming a missle launcher."	I suppose when this kanji was made, it was most effective to<strong> kill</strong> your enemies with <em>sheafs of wood</em> used as <em>missiles</em>.	"This is the Monty Python ""How not to be seen"" sketch (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Not_To_Be_Seen"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Not_To_Be_Seen</a>) where they use heat seeking <em>missiles</em> to<strong> kill</strong> people first behind <em>sheafs</em> of hay and then behind <em>trees</em>."	Sheaf, tree, missile Someone is trying to<strong> kill</strong> you. They've fired a heat seeking missile at you. You're confused with the stress and think it is a wheat seeking missile - you put a sheaf at the top of a tree to mislead it.	Wolverine, from atop a <em>tree</em>, blasts his <em>semen</em> into the below enemy's mouth, which<strong> kill</strong>s him instantly.		
爽		bracing	The sense of the key word is of something refreshing and invigorating. It is made up of the <i>St. Bernard</i> and a pair of <i>sheaves</i> on each side.		11	1608	2855	39	ソウ	あき.らか、さわ.やか、たがう	The <em>St Bernard</em> is<strong> bracing</strong> itself for an operation requiring <em>four stitches</em>.

純		genuine	Thread . . . earthworm.		10	1609	1494	39	ジュン		"<em>Earthworm Jim's</em> prized possession is a<strong> genuine</strong> copy of the #1 issue of <em>Spiderman</em>."	You need to attach a<strong> genuine</strong> earthworm to the thread. With plastic bait you won't catch anything.	The real <em>Spiderman</em> loves to eat <em>earthworms</em>—they provide essential nutrients that make his threads stronger. So next time someone goes around claiming to be the real,<strong> genuine</strong> Spiderman, give him a few earthworms to eat.	For remembering the primitive earthworm: <em>Drops of</em> rain were falling so I took my <em>shovel</em> to dig up some <strong>earthworms</strong> to put them on my <em>fishook</em>….. My story: To have a<strong> genuine</strong> fishing line you don't just pick up a stick but you also attach some<em> thread </em>onto it and at the end an <em>earthworm</em> must be hung.	"<em>Earthworm Jim's</em> prized possession is a<strong> genuine</strong> copy of the #1 issue of <em>Spiderman</em>. And oddly enough, <em>Spiderman</em>'s most prized possession is a<strong> genuine</strong> first edition of <em>Earthworm</em> Jim."

I was excited when they made a game that was a combination of <em>Metal</em> Gear and <em>Earthworm</em> Jim. But it turned out to be pretty<strong> dull</strong>.	From the earthworm's perspective, it most be pretty<strong> dull</strong> when you are put in a metal bowl, just waiting for being put on the hook on the fishing trip the next day.

辛		spicy	This character pictures food whose taste is so hot and <b>spicy</b> that it makes the hairs on your body <i>stand up</i> as straight as <i>needles</i>.	* As a primitive, we shall use this meaning of <i>spicy</i>, except when the two extra strokes are added to the bottom, giving it the form of a tree. Then we take its alternate meaning of a <i>red pepper</i> plant. The connection is obvious.	7	1612	1496	39	シン	から.い、つら.い、-づら.い、かのと	Eating<strong> spicy</strong> food makes you <em>stand up</em> <em>ten</em> times faster than usual, 'cause you just need to get something to drink!	Eating<strong> spicy</strong> food makes you stand up as if you had sat on a needle.	This caracter has 2 meaning :<strong> Spicy</strong> -> see book (からい） and heart-breaking painful （つらい） => stand up on barefooted on needles is painful.	After eating really<strong> spicy</strong> food you will probably spend most of the next day <em>stading</em> up because it will feel like you have a <em>needle</em> stuck up your arse. Numbers dont work well for me.	<strong>Spicy</strong> like drinking a vase full of needles.		
辞		resign	Tongue . . . spicy.		13	1613	1497	39	ジ	や.める、いな.む	This guy's job is tasting the <em>spicy curry</em> at the local Indian Food Factory. He has to<strong> resign</strong> from his job before his <em>tongue</em> is rendered completely useless after all the spicy food that he has to try all day long…	A lecherous male worker is forced to<strong> resign</strong> because the female employees compained about his <em>spicy</em> <em>tounge</em>.	After my <em>tongue</em> touched the most <em>spicy</em> pepper of all, I had to <strong>resign</strong> from the contest…too hot for me!	"When they guy goes to his boss to<strong> resign</strong> from the Indian Food Factory (see Fuaburisu's story) all he can say is ""Tongue….Spicy"". This helps me remember the stroke order. 辞める 【やめる】 (v1) to retire, (P) 辞意 【じい】 (n) intention to<strong> resign</strong>, (P) お辞儀 【おじぎ】 (n,vs) bow, (P)."	When you're<strong> resign</strong>ing, it's often hard to know what to say. You could say that your tongue( 舌 ) is in pain ( 辛い ).		
梓		catalpa	Tree . . . spicy.		11	1614	1498	39	シ	あずさ	"The<strong> CATALPA</strong> is the tree that bears the SPICY Indian bean (NOTE - The<strong> Catalpa</strong> is also known as the ""Indian Bean"" due to the bean pods that grow from it)."	The <strong>caterpillar's</strong> favorite <em>tree</em> is the <strong>catalpa</strong> because it tastes <em>spicy</em>.	Tree + Spicy; The<strong> catalpa</strong> <em>tree</em> has seed pods that look like <em>spicy</em> peppers.	"I know the <strong>Catalpa</strong> as the ""promise tree"". A young person will cite the person he or she loves under a <strong>Catalpa</strong> <em>tree</em> to declare his or her feelings. The fact that the right primitive means both <em>spicy</em> and <em>bitter</em> illustrates the hesitance and stress that precedes the ultimate reply."	This kanji is barely used. Just rename the keyword to PEPPER TREE (so you don't need a story) and move on. If you do a google image search for the kanji 梓 , you'll find that this character almost exclusively refers to the female name あずさ (by the way, you will see some cute girls).		
宰		superintend	House . . . spicy.		10	1615	1499	39	サイ		"<strong>Superintend</strong>ant Chalmers is dining at Principal Skinner's <em>house</em>.

壁		wall	Ketchup . . . ground.		16	1616	1500	39	ヘキ	かべ	Did anyone else used to put <em>ketchup</em> packets on the <em>ground</em> and jump on them so they spattered on the <strong>wall</strong>?	Primitive for <strong>Ketchup</strong>: When the taste is too <em>spicy</em> your <em>mouth</em> has basically given up trying to handle it ..or in other words raised the white <em>flag</em> of surrender. But unlike war , putting <strong>Ketchup</strong> on it will usually solve the problem. <strong>Wall</strong>(dingomick); Did anyone else used to put ketchup packets on the <em>ground</em> and jump on them so they spattered on the<strong> wall</strong>?	Excited about kanji 1500?	The <strong>ketchup</strong> primitive has an even more saucy true meaning: <em>Flag</em> means buttocks, <em>mouth</em> means hole and <em>spicy</em> means penetrate…	Heisig mentions <em>ketchup</em>, which I remember by imagining that someone is wiping the <em>ketchup</em> from their <em>mouth</em> with a <em>flag</em>, keeping everyone <em>standing</em> on pins and <em>needles</em>, means <em>false</em> as a kanji. So: the <em>false</em><strong> wall</strong> led to a secret lair under<em>ground</em>.		
璧		holed gem	The <b>holed gem</b> to which this kanji refers is a flat, circular object of about a foot in length, made of stone or glass and having a large hole in the middle. It's elements: <i>ketchup</i> . . . <i>ball</i>.		18	1617	3021	39	ヘキ	たま	This kanji shows a policeman with a <strong>holed gem</strong> (which can be thought of as <em>jewelry</em>, I guess), but he thinks it's a doughnut. For some reason though, he liked his doughnuts with ketchup on them, so he added some, and tried to take a bite. He lost a few teeth on the process.	<strong>perfection</strong>: Only the tomatoes of perfection, comparable to jewels, were used for the expensive ketchup.	"完璧 <a href=""../v4/3021.html"">holed gem</a> (#3021 璧) <strong>Holed Gem</strong> RTK ＃1500.1 ヘキ … Parts: 壁 - 土 , 玉 … Note: This is a new official Kanji added 05/10 to the Japanese lists.

IRL this is just the second half of 完璧 . It's only used in that compound, but that compound is very very common, and means <strong>Perfect!</strong> as an exclamation. …"	It's a little known fact that <em>ketchup</em> is highly corrosive and is used to cut <strong>holes</strong> into <strong>gemstones</strong> so they can be put onto chains. This kanji shows a piece of <em>Jade</em> with a blob of <em>ketchup</em> on the top eating a hole through it.	<strong>Holed Gem</strong>, <em>ketchup</em>, <em>jewel</em>. According to Rikichan, this is bi (ancient Chinese artifact, flat jade or glass disc with a circular hole in the centre). It used to be a perfect un<strong>holed gem</strong> until Indiana Jones showed up and replaced the <em>jewel</em> in the center with <em>ketchup</em>. All they were left with was a piece of worthless glass with a hole in middle. But it did taste good.		
避		evade	Ketchup . . . road.		16	1618	1501	39	ヒ	さ.ける、よ.ける	You can try and<strong> evade</strong> them, but they'll ketchup with you on the road… Sorry, couldn't resist it.	In order to<strong> evade</strong> the bear, you lie down on the road, put ketchup on yourself, and play dead.	A giant Heinz Tomato <em>Ketchup</em> truck crashed on the road, spilling giant globs of ketchup everywhere. They didn't close the <em>road</em>, but you have to<strong> evade</strong> the globs of <em>ketchup</em> as you drive.	You have a very nice vehicle (whatever you like). A truck has been losing his ketchup bottle load on the road. You are trying to<strong> evade</strong> these bottles or you will stain your vehicle and that would be the end of the world…(a high speed chase with a cool bike, evading ketchup bottles on the road).	James Bond's latest car is equipped with ketchup that can be sprayed along the road to<strong> evade</strong> enemies.

薪		firewood	Flowers . . . new.		16	1620	1503	39	シン	たきぎ、まき	If your<strong> firewood</strong> is too <em>new</em> and still has <em>flowers</em> on it, it's unsuitable for burning. You need drier wood.

Everyone knows now with the price of <strong>fuel</strong> that / ""<strong>Firewood</strong> is the <em>new</em> <em>flowers</em>"" / Go on, get some <strong>firewood</strong> today and make her Valentine's Day dreams come true."	Sometimes, <em>new</em><strong> firewood</strong> still has <em>flowers</em> on it.

Axe-man brings a new bunch of flowers for his wife each time he goes gathering<strong> firewood</strong>. Each time he tries to find new flowers, different from the previous ones. He actually spends more time looking for new flowers, than he does gathering the<strong> firewood</strong> !		
親		parent	Red pepper . . . see.		16	1621	1504	39	シン	おや、おや-、した.しい、した.しむ	I remember this one the way the Japanese do: a<strong> parent</strong> <em>standing</em> on top of a <em>tree</em> <em>watching</em> what his or her kid is doing.	"A wise <strong>parent</strong> lets their kids learn. A kid wants to try to eat the <em>red pepper plant</em>, the wise <strong>parent</strong> says ""Try it and <em>see</em> for yourself""."

幸		happiness	Simply by turning the dot at the top of the primitive for <i>spicy</i> into a cross shape, we move from things bitter and <i>spicy</i> to things <b>happy</b>.		8	1622	1505	39	コウ	さいわ.い、さち、しあわ.せ	<strong>happiness</strong> is the ONE bite of SPICY curry.

(oh well, Heisig used similar one for 百 )."	<strong>Happiness</strong> and pain(spicy) are just one stroke diffence. It's a fine balance.	"A rare instance in which Heisig made a mistake in the primitives. The bottom is not <em>spicy</em>, because there is no <em>vase</em> or <em>standing</em> here–the first horizontal stroke of the ""vase"" is too long. Rather, this is <em>soil</em> and a new primitive below, which we shall call a garden-variety <em>goat</em>. It's like the <em>mountain goat</em> in frame 1959, just not in the mountains. Thus,<strong> happiness</strong> is exemplified by a <em>goat</em> nibbling on <em>soil</em>ed garbage on the <em>ground</em>.

(It's<strong> Tenacious</strong>-D time, ya muthafucka', gwaoh!).	To be<strong> tenacious</strong>, you need to have deep stores of happiness (so troubles don't discourage you) and you need to be big and round (so hunger doesn't drive you to give up). The most<strong> tenacious</strong> person of all time was happy round Buddha!	The <em>fat man</em> Santa Claus is <strong>tenacious</strong> about carrying out his duty to bring <em>happiness</em> to all the children of the world on Christmas day.	<strong>Tenacious</strong> D is a band of happy, round fellows.

You can hold a CORNUCOPIA up to your MOUTH (like a megaphone) to<strong> SHOUT</strong> lounder. Also notice that the shape of CORNUCOPIA implies the<strong> shout</strong>s are 4 letter words.	FOUR!! like in golf, someone<strong> shout</strong>s four and you see the golf ball right in front of you.	"<strong>Note</strong>: the <em>cornucopia</em> primitive is not described adequately in Heisig.

碑		tombstone	Rock . . . lowly.		14	1630	1512	39	ヒ	いしぶみ	There is a grave of a <em>lowly</em> man with a<strong> tombstone</strong> made of a simple, small <em>stone</em>. If you bow really low you can read the very small inscription engraved on the <em>stone</em>, it says - “Now that you bowed so low to read this, you are as <em>lowly</em> as I once was”.	A STONE makes a LOWLY<strong> TOMBSTONE</strong>.	Rocks are actually sentient beings with social structure, and it just so happens that the <em>lowliest of stones</em> are chosen to end up as humiliating<strong> tombstone</strong>s.	A simple stone serves as the<strong> tombstone</strong> of a lowly peasant.	The <em>lowly</em> only get a solitary <em>rock</em> upon their resting places as a<strong> tombstone</strong> (while the highly get monuments like Stone Henge).		
陸		land	"The sense of <b>land</b> carried by this kanji is distinct from <i>soil</i> (Frame 161) and <i>ground</i> (Frame 554) in that it is meant to represent <b>land</b> seen from a distance, that is, <i>land</i> as opposed to ""water.""

Could it be the Promised<strong> Land</strong>?	When sailors see<strong> land</strong> in the distance, they first see the <em>pinnacles</em> of the new<strong> land</strong>, but when they come close enough they'll be able to make out the <em>rice seedlings</em>, and finally the <em>ground</em>!	(圥 is the rare kanji for a mushroom. Sticking out of the <em>ground</em> like little knubby <em>legs</em>, it's pretty easy to remember.)

The Pinnacle's<strong> land</strong> is so valuable that they cannot afford to let a single rice seedling be planted in the soil.

亥		sign of the hog	This kanji is the 12th sign of the Chinese zodiac: the <b>sign of the hog</b>. It is best learned by thinking of an acorn-eating <b>hog</b> in connection with the primitive meaning given below.	* The <i>top hat</i> represents the external shape of the <i>acorn</i>, and the unusual but easily written complex of strokes beneath it (which you might also see as distortions of an <i>elbow</i> and <i>person</i>) stands for the mysterious secret whereby the <i>acorn</i> contains the oak tree in a nutshell.	6	1637	1519	39	ガイ、カイ	い	A greedy hog in a top hat who has eaten all of the acorns. He even elbows people out of the way to get them.	Top Hat + Elbow + Person: The<strong> sign of the hog</strong> was a very recognizable tattoo - a hog with a big grin in a <em>top hat</em>, sticking his <em>elbow</em> into the <em>person</em> next to him.	This is easy, if you know Mr. Peanut, the logo of Planters. Replace his face or body with an acorn and you have Mr. Acorn, the logo /<strong> sign of the hog</strong>. He wears the same <em>top hat</em>, has the same turned out <em>elbow</em> holding a diagonal <em>walking stick</em>, and poses like a <em>human</em>.	Warning: Stroke order in book is wrong. The top hat should be written as normal.	Q: What is the difference between a pig and a hog? A: A hog is the generic term for all swine. Pigs are immature hogs weighing less than 125 pounds. Other swine related terms include the following: Piglet: a baby swine less than ten weeks old (nursing pig) Sow: a female pig that has had a litter Boar: a male hog (with tusks?).		
核		nucleus	Tree . . . acorn.		10	1638	1520	39	カク		The<strong> nucleus</strong> of an oak TREE is an ACORN.	In the<strong> nucleus</strong> of the acorn, all the DNA is stored – the building blocks for a new tree.	Ernest Rutherford discovered the<strong> Nucleus</strong>. Picture him sitting under a tree pondering atoms, after an ACORN falls on him he suddenly understands that each atom has a<strong> nucleus</strong>.

刻		engrave	Acorn . . . saber.		8	1639	1521	39	コク	きざ.む、きざ.み	This famous ninja (I always use ninjas with <em>sabres</em>, distinct from samurai) used to<strong> engrave</strong> the kanji for his name onto <em>acorns</em>, and throw the <em>acorns</em> to distract his enemies. The legend goes that by the time his victims would pick up the <em>acorn</em> and read the<strong> engrave</strong>d kanji, they were already dead.	While it's traditional for lovers to<strong> engrave</strong> their names on a tree in many countries, in Japan, however, it was traditional for a samurai to signify his undying love for a woman by engraving the kanji of her name on an <em>acorn</em> with his <em>sabre</em>.	"TIP: This also means ""time""… STORY: The Swiss watchmaker is a master<strong> engrave</strong>r.

The<strong> above-stated</strong> <em>words</em> are the <em>acorn</em> from which the following statement grows.	I literally imagined atree with <em>words</em> stuck on <em>acorns</em>. And thus the <em>words</em> are<strong> above-stated</strong> (that is until they fall on your head I guess). (This one really needs a mental picture).	"<strong>ABOVE-STATED</strong> is a synonym with ACORNmentioned. I mean ""aforementioned"". Really easy to remember if you just think of ACORNmentioned."	You, a hog, just asked what the word means. Socrates answers:'The meaning of this word is stated above' 'yes, but I don't understand the kanji.' S:'Well it is stated above' ' I just told you that I dont understand it.' S:'The word is stated above''Yes but…' S:' You dum hog, stated above is the word'… this could go on for a while as the kanji you are pointing to is 該 .

We investigated their tree, and the only<strong> remains</strong> there were their <em>skeleton</em>s and a huge pile of <em>acorn</em>s.

The liberal squirrel blogged that he would give all his ACORNS to congress if it would exercise its POWER to<strong> censure</strong> Bush and Cheney.	Animal Farm works for me - where the <em>hogs</em> have the greatest <em>power</em> of<strong> censure</strong>.	Sorry, I know this is crude, but it's just so easy to remember: if you expose your acorns and your muscle in public, you'll be<strong> censure</strong>d.	"<strong>Censure</strong> is the political equivalent of a ""strongly worded letter,"" according to Cornell's School of Law. It is a flex of muscle by congress against the current president, but it is a very weak one.

Some strange animal tried to steal a stalk of celery from my house. However, it was freezing and the floor was covered in ice, so the mysterious animal couldn't get any traction. Picture a <em>stalk of celery</em> and a <em>pair of animal legs</em> slipping and sliding clumsily around the <em>ice</em>, and never able to leave the <em>house</em>. Eventually it got so<strong> cold</strong> that the little animal froze to death.	"The story of gordon is really great except that there is a tremendous mistake : this kanji is used for the weather , the temperature (samui 寒い ) …. not for the feeling to the touch : for this one it's tsumetai 冷たい <a href=""../v4/1404.html"">cool</a> (#1404 冷) the jap HOUSE are infamous for being insanely<strong> cold</strong> .

Did you ever see that Tom and Jerry episode where they made it so<strong> cold</strong> that the inside of the <em>house</em> became a winter wonderland, and Jerry grabbed some <em>celery</em> and used his <em>animal legs</em> to skate and sled around on the <em>ice</em>? It was a real <em>celery</em>-bration, ha ha… ha..	When it's freezing<strong> cold</strong> outside (ice everywhere), it's best to stay in the house, eating celery (winter vegetable) and wear your bunny slippers (animal legs).

To me, the grass skirt is composed of six celery sticks and a scarf. Apparently you can<strong> brew</strong> whiskey out of grass skirts. No wonder it tastes horrible.	"Note : up to frame 1530, the kanji share the same chinese reading (JOU), so don't hesitate to group them into the same environment.

Whether once a month is rare or not depends on what we're talking about, but that happens to be the origin of the expression."	The last time I saw a <strong>blue</strong> <em>moon</em> was in my <strong>youth</strong> when I was <em>growing up</em>.	<strong>Blue</strong> = Smurfs, whose <em>bodies</em> never <em>grow up</em>.	They say that as the sun gets older, it grows up and becomes red. However, that's not the case for the <em>moon</em>, which turns<strong> blue</strong> as it <em>grows up</em>.	Once in a<strong> Blue</strong> <em>moon</em> you can see <em>Peter Pan</em> flying high above it.		
精		refined	Rice . . . blue.		14	1655	1535	40	セイ、ショウ、シヤウ		Before <em>rice</em> is<strong> refined</strong>, it is actually <em>blue</em>…bet ya didn't know that!! (alternate….<em>Condi Rice</em> was <em>blue</em> when insurgents blew up the iraqi <strong>refinery</strong> where oil is <strong>refined</strong>).	Very<strong> refined</strong> people in the upper classes have skin as pale as <em>rice</em> and <em>blue</em> blood.	"NB This means ""spirit"", ""vitality"", ""essence"", ""semen"". For vitality, you need to eat healthy food, symbolized by rice, and exercise under the blue sky."	The job of the smurfs. not many people know this, but it is to create the most<strong> refined</strong> rice in the world.	"""Uh, why is your rice blue?"" ""It's been<strong> refined</strong>! And by 'refined' I mean it's been in the back of my fridge for a few months.""."		
請		solicit	Words . . . blue.		15	1656	1536	40	セイ、シン、ショウ	こ.う、う.ける	"That door-to-door salesman can stand outside ringing my doorbell until he's <em>blue</em> in the face. There's a big sign on my front door, and the <em>words</em> clearly say ""No<strong> Solicit</strong>ing""."	You can <em>talk</em> until you're <em>blue</em> in the face, but if you're trying to<strong> solicit</strong> me, you're just wasting your time…	Going through smurf blue light district - heres a smurfette saying all sorts of dirty words trying to<strong> solicit</strong> herself.	When you're blue, you need to<strong> solicit</strong> words to help you.	The <em>Blue Man Group</em> need no <em>Words</em> to<strong> Solicit</strong> themselves. They naturally draw a crowd without ever speaking a word.		
情		feelings	<i>State of mind</i> . . . <i>blue</i>. Do not confuse with <i>emotion</i> (Frame 662).		11	1657	1537	40	ジョウ、セイ	なさ.け	<em>Data</em> is <strong>feeling</strong> <em>blue</em> about not having any <strong>feelings</strong> … hey, wait a minute.	Feeling blue is a state of mind where you're dominated by your<strong> feelings</strong>.	"Spending too much time with one's<strong> feelings</strong> leads to the ""having the blues"", which we can put graphically as a <em>blue</em> <em>state of mind</em>."	Feeling <em>blue</em> is your <em>state of mind</em> when someone hurts your<strong> feelings</strong>.	When your <em>state of mind</em> is <em>blue</em>, you tend to want to talk about your<strong> feelings</strong>.		
晴		clear up	Take the key word in its associations with the weather (unless that tempts you to include the primitive for <i>weather</i>, which doesn't belong here). Its elements: <i>sun</i> . . . <i>blue</i>.		12	1658	1538	40	セイ	は.れる、は.れ、は.れ-、-ば.れ、は.らす	Sun and blue sky! Yep, the weather's cleared up!	When we speak of <strong>clearing up</strong> we easily think of both the <em>sun</em> and <em>blue</em> skies. But in another since to<strong> clear up</strong> is the absence of weather. And therefor the reason weather has no place in its writing.	The sky <strong>cleared up</strong> and we have a <em>sunny blue day</em>.	Its clear weather now. Smufs are sunbathing. Sun and blue sky. What more do they need?	Once it clears up, the sun will wash your blues away!		
清		pure	Water . . . blue.		11	1659	1539	40	セイ、ショウ、シン	きよ.い、きよ.まる、きよ.める	<strong>Pure</strong> sea <em>water</em> is always a radiant <em>blue</em>.	Bottles of water claim to be<strong> pure</strong>. They're generally in blue containers, because blue makes you feel like its that much more<strong> pure</strong>.	<strong>Pure</strong> water is<strong> pure</strong> blue.	Aristocrats who boast of the purity of their lineage claim to have blue blood, as suggested by the delicate blue veins showing under their pale, thin skin. Here one of them is moved to cut himself, letting a few blue drops out to show the purity of his ancestry, breeding and intentions.	You can't say (せい) that there is anything<strong> pure</strong>r than crystal clear <em>blue water</em> from the ocean.		
静		quiet	<i>Blue</i> . . . <i>contend</i>. Do not confuse with <i>calm</i> (Frame 1230).		14	1660	1540	40	セイ、ジョウ	しず-、しず.か、しず.まる、しず.める	When someone you know who is normally talkative goes<strong> quiet</strong>, it's usually a sign that they are <em>contending</em> with the <em>blues</em>.	"""And the next <em>contend</em>er is…. a <em>Smurf</em>!"" As you can imagine, the crowd goes <strong>quiet</strong> with shock."	When you feel <em>blue</em>, you want to go somewhere<strong> quiet</strong> to help you <em>contend</em> with your problems.	The once proud and boisterous contender has been smacked down by a smurf and is<strong> quiet</strong> for once.	Best way to get kids to be<strong> quiet</strong>. Have a<strong> quiet</strong> contest. Each contender must be<strong> quiet</strong> by holding their breath until they turn blue in the face.		
責		blame	Grow up . . . oyster.		11	1661	1541	40	セキ	せ.める	As one <em>grows up</em>, one typically starts to<strong> blame</strong> all of their problems on <em>money</em>.	This is the story of a poor fisherman and his wife. A long time ago he caught an oyster with a small but precious pearl. The intelligent wife told him to sell the pearl immediately: the greedy husband figured if he kept the oyster and fed it, it would grow up and yield an even bigger pearl. One day the <em>oyster grew so big</em>, it crashed through the house and escaped back to sea. The angry wife left her husband, <strong>blaming</strong> his blind greed for their poverty.	"Alice (<a href=""../v4/1531.html"">poison</a> (#1531 毒))<strong> blame</strong>s her strange adventures on a batch of bad raw oysters."	Those poor little oysters will never grow up now. And who's to<strong> blame</strong>? The Walrus and the Carpenter of course.	"Peter Pan farts a lot, and he<strong> blame</strong>s it on all the oysters he greedily devours! Tinkerbell says, ""Peter, stop blaming the shells and grow up!""."		
績		exploits	Thread . . . blame.		17	1662	1542	40	セキ		<em>Spidey'</em>s<strong> exploits</strong> are world famous but still The Daily Bugle's pages <em>blame</em> him for every problem out there.	[Geek alert] A lot of modern software is full of<strong> exploits</strong> which can be abused by hackers. I blame multi-threading.	"Thorough psychological analysis reveals that all of Spiderman's villains are actually obsessed with him and long to be ""dominated"" by him. Therefore, the citizens of New York have no-one to <em>blame</em> but <em>Spiderman</em> for these villains' reckless<strong> exploits</strong>."	<em>Spiderman's</em><strong> exploits</strong> have earned him fame and <em>blame</em>.	The<strong> exploits</strong> of the RTK online community are such that every single poster has personified the thread radical into Spiderman. I blame it on the video games and TV that the kids are watching now-a-days.		
積		volume	<i>Wheat</i> . . . <i>blame</i>. This key word has to do with measurement, and should be kept distinct from the kanji for <i>quantity</i> (Frame 189) - even though the meanings are similar.		16	1663	1543	40	セキ	つ.む、-づ.み、つ.もる、つ.もり	"On many <em>wheat cereal</em> boxes, there is a disclaimer stating that ""This package is sold by weight, not by<strong> volume</strong>. Some settling of contents may have occurred."" well they only say that because they don't want to be <em>blame</em>d by people getting really disappointed after they see what a small<strong> volume</strong> of <em>cereal</em> the box really contains."	The <strong>volume</strong> of the <em>wheat</em> crop is way down this year! <em>Blame</em> the weather!	<em>Wheaties</em> and other cereals are sold by weight, not<strong> volume</strong>, in order to avoid <em>blame</em> if the contents settle. (simplified version of sweetneet's).	The<strong> volume</strong> of <em>wheat</em> I ate is to <em>blame</em> for my weight gain.	Most people say carbohydrates (<em>grain</em>) are to <em>blame</em> for their excessive <strong>volume</strong>.		
債		bond	<i>Person</i> . . . <i>blame</i>. The key word refers to financial <b>bonds</b>.		13	1664	1544	40	サイ		Mr. T's plot of world domination is foiled. Who is to blame?<strong> Bond</strong>. James<strong> Bond</strong>.	[bond; loan; debt] <em>Mr. T</em> buys a lot of high risk<strong> bond</strong>s and then <em>blames</em> his broker when they all plummet in value.	It also means Loan and Debt: A friend of mine (or if you prefer, Mr. T) bought<strong> Bond</strong>s worth 1000 dollars, which came from a Loan from his parents. As predicted by his coworkers, family and friends, he lost everything in 3 days. He is the only Person to Blame. Now he has big Debt (true story).	OBAMA won't take the BLAME for the drop in<strong> BOND</strong> markets, he'll blame Bush.	<em>Mr. </em>T came by my house and demanded I repay my<strong> bond</strong>s. But I told him it wasn't my fault—my annoying neighbor is to <em>blame</em>. Huh? It worked!? Seems like he went next door and beat my neighbor to a pulp!		
漬		pickling	Water . . . blame.		14	1665	1545	40	シ	つ.ける、つ.かる、-づ.け、-づけ	When <strong>pickling</strong> you MUST use distilled water! When it doesn't come out right, generally it is the <em>water</em> that is to <em>blame</em>.	Bad <em>water</em> is to <em>blame</em> for the process of <strong>pickling</strong>.	When the<strong> pickling</strong> doesn't come out right, generally the water is to blame.	Think of knocking over a big jar of dill pickles and spilling water everywhere, then blaming your friend.	During<strong> pickling</strong>, <em>water</em> is drawn out of the vegetable or fruit. Thus the<strong> pickling</strong> agent (miso, salt etc.) is responsible (to <em>blame</em>) for robbing the pickled item of its water.		
表		surface	"<i>Grow up</i> . . . <i>rags</i>. This character represents the ""outside"" of a garment, just as the kanji for <i>back</i> (Frame 426) depicted the ""inside"" or lining."		8	1666	1546	40	ヒョウ	おもて、-おもて、あらわ.す、あらわ.れる、あら.わす	When I was GROWING UP, the<strong> SURFACE</strong> of my SCARF was always covered with snot from blowing my nose on it.	As girls <em>grow up</em>, something slowly <strong>surfaces</strong> from under their <em>scarf</em>.	<em>Alice</em> got back to the<strong> surface</strong> by climbing up the rabbit hole on an extremely long <em>scarf</em>.	Imagine a <em>scarf</em> <em>growing up</em> until it covers the entire<strong> SURFACE</strong> of the world.	"It seems to mean ""outer layer"". Some animals shed their <strong>surface</strong> as they <em>grow up</em>. If it doesn't shed fully they end up wearing it like a <em>scarf</em>!"		
俵		bag	Keep this kanji distinct from that for <i>sack</i> (Frame 1081). Its elements are: <i>person</i> . . . <i>surface</i>.		10	1667	1547	40	ヒョウ	たわら	<em>Mr. T</em>'s punching<strong> bag</strong> has one beat up <em>surface</em>.	Do you know why every <em>person</em> in Japan has a Louis Vuitton<strong> bag</strong>? After the 1985 JAL air crash that killed 520 people (the world's worst). An image on tv of the crash showed Louis Vuitton<strong> bag</strong>s (whose LV logo covered <em>surface</em> was somehow impervious) litering the crash site. From that point on they stuck in Japanese people's mind's as durable and high quality. (True story).	Superficial <em>people</em> (ie those who are only concerned about the <em>surface</em>) are obsessed with expensive<strong> bag</strong>s.	<em>Haruhi</em> is imprinted on the <em>surface</em> of my<strong> bag</strong>.	"TIP: Not a<strong> bag</strong>, this is a straw container that looks like a straw bale. Also used to mark the edge of the sumo ring… STORY: When <em>Mr T</em> tried sumo wrestling he got knocked right to the <em>surface</em> of the dohyo and ended up staring at the <strong>tawara</strong>… 俵 [たわら] <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E5%9C%9F%E4%BF%B5"">、土俵</a> [どひょう]."		
潔		undefiled	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>grow up</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>thread</i>. Do not confuse with <i>upright</i> (Frame 58).		15	1668	1548	40	ケツ	いさぎよ.い	To ensure she remained<strong> undefiled</strong>, a young girl <em>growing up</em> in a rough area always kept a <em>dagger</em> concealed under her <em>threads</em>, even when she went into the <em>water</em>.	(rgravina) To ensure she remained<strong> undefiled</strong>, a young girl <em>growing up</em> in a rough area always kept a <em>dagger</em> concealed under her <em>Spiderman underwear</em> (to remember the position of <em>thread</em>), even when she went into the <em>water</em>.	<em>Venom</em>'s suit is self-cleaning and remains<strong> undefiled</strong>, despite its forming weapons, <em>growing up</em> into <em>daggers</em> and killing people, sending <em>drops of fluid</em> (blood) flying everywhere. No <em>water</em> necessary, and his conscience is clean too.	"Oh no, comeback of the dirty imagery.. And I thought I got rid of that. Anyway, the ""grown-up dagger"" is a, um, phallus (are these characters like the Rorschach ink blots? Freud would be proud). Here someone ties a thread around it, so that dirty liquid won't come out of it and his surroundings remain<strong> undefiled</strong>."	By <em>growing up</em> with a <em>dagger</em> under his pillow, <em>Venom</em> remained<strong> undefiled</strong> until marriage. He even washed himself with holy <em>water</em> just to be sure.		
契		pledge	<i>Grow up</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>St. Bernard dog</i>. The connotation of this character should be kept distinct from that for <i>vow</i> (Frame 1214) and <i>promise</i> (Frame 1462).		9	1669	1549	40	ケイ	ちぎ.る	Imagine a totalitarian regime where, while <em>growing up</em>, you have to<strong> pledge</strong> allegiance to the flag at <em>dagger</em>-point and with <em>St. Bernard</em> guard dogs watching you.	With our new pills we<strong> pledge</strong> to <em>grow</em> your <em>dagger bigger </em> - typical junk mail.	In order to <strong>pledge</strong> into her sorority, <em>Alice</em> had to stab a <em>St. Bernard</em> with a <em>dagger</em>. (Come on! DO it, <em>Alice</em>!).	In medieval Japan often to form an alliance Warlords would give up their daughter as a<strong> pledge</strong>. She would <em>grow up</em> guarded by <em>daggers</em> and <em>St. Bernard</em> dogs. If the alliance was broken she would be killed (More or less true).	"""I<strong> pledge</strong> my allegiance to the flag….: "" <em>Growing up</em> we<strong> pledge</strong>d out allegiance to the flag of our nation to protect it from being torn or disgraced such as with <em>daggers</em> or to fall on the ground and be ripped to shreds by <em>dogs</em>."		
喫		consume	Mouth . . . pledge.		12	1670	1550	40	キツ		This means eat/drink/smoke. Maybe you make a pledge to stop gutsing/binging/puffing, but your own mouth is tempting you to put something in it.	I make my <em>mouth pledge</em> to<strong> consume</strong> less.	New American <em>pledge</em> of allegiance: I will<strong> consume</strong>.	After <em>pledging</em>, Alice and the sorority<strong> consume</strong>d the St. Bernard with their <em>mouths</em>.	You have an eating problem and always<strong> CONSUME</strong> too much, cramming it in your MOUTH. Here, you make a PLEDGE to<strong> CONSUME</strong> less, maybe by keeping your MOUTH shut more often.		
害		harm	House . . . grow up . . . mouth.		10	1671	1551	40	ガイ		With kids <em>growing up</em> in your <em>house</em>, you have to keep them from <strong>harm</strong> of putting anything in their <em>mouth</em>, paint chips, bleach, knvies, etc.	This is silly, but.. If a house suddenly grows up from your mouth, you will come to great<strong> harm</strong>.	Babies think that there's no<strong> harm</strong> in putting stuff in their mouths, but you just know that one day they'll find a growth pill, eat it and crash through the roof of your house as they grow.	In the <em>house</em>, whenever <em>Alice</em> opens her <em>mouth</em> (to eat or drink) she causes <strong>harm</strong> (by growing too big for the house).	<strong>Harm</strong> is being done all throughout the <em>house</em> that <em>Peter Pan</em> lives in. Him and all the lost boys are all putting things they aren't supposed to into their mouths! (thanks dingomick) I'm going to call this the lost boys house.		
轄		control	"<i>Car</i> . . . <i>harm</i>. Hint: the image of an auto going ""out of <b>control</b>"" may help keep this key word distinct from others like it, such as <i>manipulate</i> (Frame 864)."		17	1672	1552	40	カツ	くさび	<strong>Control</strong> is very important! Especially when operating a <em>car</em>. Few people realize the <em>harm</em> they can cause just by losing <strong>control</strong> of their <em>car</em> for a second. Tremendous <em>harm</em>. Stay in <strong>control</strong>!	The roads are icy, and a whole bunch of <em>cars</em> have spun out of<strong> control</strong>! Luckily, it was just a couple of dents; nobody was <em>harmed</em>.	If you lose<strong> control</strong> of your car, you may come to great harm.	Losing<strong> control</strong> of your car results in great harm.	In Knightrider, the <em>car</em> KITT was in<strong> control</strong>, making sure no <em>harm</em> came to the Hoff.		
割		proportion	Harm . . . saber.		12	1673	1553	40	カツ	わ.る、わり、わ.り、わ.れる、さ.く	[proportion; comparatively; divide; cut; separate; split] Hey, don't take this out of <strong>proportion</strong>! I did you just a little <em>harm</em>, no need to come over here with a <em>saber</em>…	As shown on this pie-chart, the<strong> proportion</strong> of people <em>harmed</em> by <em>sabres</em> is relatively a small slice compared to those <em>harmed</em> by guns.	In Japanese anime and video games, the heroes often have <em>sabers</em> that seem way out of<strong> proportion</strong> to their weilders, especially with how scrawny these pointy-haired kids tend to be. I'm not sure if the<strong> proportion</strong>s of those <em>sabers</em> will cause more <em>harm</em> to their enemies or their weilders… Or, I'm surprised they don't <em>harm</em> themselves with the<strong> proportion</strong>s of their <em>sabres</em>.	The <em>harm</em> caused by a <em>saber</em> is not always in<strong> proportion</strong> to its size.	The harm is<strong> proportion</strong>al to the size of the saber.		
憲		constitution	The key word refers to the fundamental guiding principles of a government or other organization. Its elements: <i>House</i> . . . <i>grow up</i> . . . <i>eyes</i> . . . <i>heart</i>.		16	1674	1554	40	ケン		The <strong>constitution</strong> is important. At least my parents thought so. In the <em>house</em> where I <em>grew up</em>, it was framed on the wall. Under the watchful (sideways) <em>eye</em> of my mother, we had to study it until we knew it by <em>heart</em>.	The <em>house</em> of US Congress needs to <em>grow up</em>! Their <em>twisted</em> eyes have lost the <em>heart</em> of the <strong>constitution</strong>.	The original Japanese<strong> constitution</strong> is locked up deep within the Imperial Palace, <em>home</em> of the Emperor. Since its creation, it's gotten <em>bigger and bigger</em>, and it's even grown a <em>pair of eyes</em>, as well as a <em>beating heart</em>. Naturally the Emperor tries to keep this hidden from the public, but what will they do once the<strong> constitution</strong>-monster becomes big enough to destroy the palace?	I <em>grow up</em> in a <em>house</em> which values the<strong> constitution</strong>. My father always told me to look not just with my <em>eyes</em> but with my <em>heart</em> as well.	"[ +CharleyGarret + Growing up=Peter Pan] In Peter Pan's Lost Boys house, they eye the consitution every day and have learned it by heart. ""No Lost Girls, Captain Hook stinks, we'll never grow up! We'll scream till we're pink!"" (Hey, I'm trying here - there are no other Peter Pan stories.)."		
生		life	A single <i>drop</i> added to the element for <i>grow up</i> gives us the character for <b>life</b>.	* As a primitive, we may think of a microscopic cell, that miraculous unit that grows up to become a living being.	5	1675	1555	40	セイ、ショウ	い.きる、い.かす、い.ける、う.まれる、う.まれ、うまれ、う.む、お.う、は.える、は.やす、き、なま、なま-、な.る、な.す、む.す、-う	This is the first CELL of a human, the foundation of its entire<strong> LIFE</strong>, a small DROP that will GROW UP to form a complex organism.

From Mary Shelley's work along with Young Frankenstein and other references.	Add a <em>drop</em> of miracle <em>grow</em> and a plant really comes to<strong> life</strong>.	<strong>Life</strong> starts with a <em>drop</em> of sperm and then you <em>grow up</em>.		
星		star	Sun . . . cell.		9	1676	1556	40	セイ、ショウ	ほし、-ぼし	The <em>sun</em> is the nearest<strong> star</strong> to the only planet with <em>life</em> - Earth.	Sun is a<strong> star</strong> that has given life. Can't say that of any other<strong> star</strong>s yet.	Our<strong> star</strong>, the <em>sun</em>, gives life to all <em>cells</em>.	The SUN is the<strong> STAR</strong> that gives LIFE to our planet.	One <em>day</em> in my <em>life</em> i will be a<strong> star</strong>!		
醒		awakening	Whisky bottle . . . star.		16	1677	2750	40	セイ	さ.ます、さ.める	On<strong> awakening</strong> the first thing I notice is a (nearly empty) <em>whiskey bottle</em> by my bed. Then I see the <em>stars</em> are still shining. “I think I’ll go back to sleep and try<strong> awakening</strong> again later.”.	You'll need an<strong> awakening</strong> after the <em>whiskey bottle</em> makes you see <em>stars</em>.	My<strong> awakening</strong> came not from ordinary hallucinogens but from extraordinary <em>whiskey</em>: I saw <em>stars</em>.	The first thing I see when I <strong>awaken</strong> is <em>stars</em>, I wonder why until I feel the <em>whiskey bottle</em> next to me. Ah crap, I still need to <strong>sober up</strong>.

姓		surname	Woman . . . cell.		8	1678	1557	40	セイ、ショウ		When <em>women</em> marry, they adopt the<strong> surname</strong> of their husband, signifiying the start of a new <em>life</em> together. (adapted from gorgon).	"<em>Woman</em> change their<strong> surname</strong> when they ""start their new <em>life</em>""."	"To help you keep this separate from <a href=""../v4/1828.html"">family name</a> (#1828 氏) (as I have been doing lately…), picture a woman who just married a man, and of course, she adopts his<strong> surname</strong> and they start a new life together. Throughout their entire life together, he requires her to address him as ""sir."" Yes, like the sur in ""surname""."	<em>Women</em> should keep their own<strong> surname</strong> when they marry. Changing<strong> surname</strong> is like disavowing your previous <em>life</em>.	The <em>woman</em> didn't want to marry <em>Frankenstein</em> in the first place, much less have to change her <strong>surname</strong>. (Image: the bride griamcing in the contables office signing the certificate to change her name).		
性		sex	State of mind . . . cell.		8	1679	1558	40	セイ、ショウ	さが	<strong>Sex</strong> is the only <em>state of mind</em> for many men through their whole <em>life</em>.	When you're in the <em>state of mind</em> for creating new <em>lives</em>.	I think this can also mean <strong>gender</strong>–one could look at the differences between <strong>gender</strong> and <strong>sex</strong>: one is a <em>state of mind</em>, the other is set biologically in the <em>cells</em>.	<em>Data's</em> <em>life</em> did not begin with<strong> sex</strong>.	Despite being of the same <strong>sex</strong>, <em>Data</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em> do each other knowing it's the only<strong> sex</strong> they'll ever get. (Image: do I even have to paint this one…?).		
牲		animal sacrifice	Cow . . . cell.		9	1680	1559	40	セイ		<strong>Animal sacrifice</strong> = taking the life of a cow.	In the 21st century,<strong> animal sacrifice</strong> is no longer really necessary. We can take a single cell from a cow, with no harm to the cow. We create a viable cell line from this single cell, and feed the resulting biomatter into a furnace at the exact rate necessary to appease the gods.	The whole <em>life</em> of a <em>cow</em> is like one big long<strong> animal sacrifice</strong>.	<em>Life</em> for a <em>cow</em> in India is pretty good. At least they would never be used as an animal scarifice.	"There are two kanji that should be kept separate: <a href=""../v4/643.html"">sacrifice</a> (#643 犠) ( 義 ), and this one. Think of it this way: in 義 there is a <em>cow</em> and a <em>righteous</em> person (presumably a Hindu). One must be <strong>SACRIFICE</strong>d, so naturally the righteous Hindu took the place of the holy cow. But as the Hindu is no longer alive to protect the cow, so we will now take the <em>cow's life</em> in an <strong>animal sacrifice</strong>."

"The salesman is <em>standing on the cliff</em>'s edge. ""Buy my<strong> products</strong>!! Buy my<strong> products</strong>! Or else I'll take my own <em>life</em>""! Man, that's selling on pressure."	Japanese are obsesed with all the<strong> products</strong> they can buy. Stand up for your self!! take the<strong> products</strong> to a cliff, threw them off, and stat a new life!!!	People <em>stand</em> on a <em>cliff</em> and want to end their <em>lifes</em>. This is a <strong>product</strong> of todays society.	A Biotech company has an unusual showcase for their<strong> products</strong>: they line up the <em>vases</em> full of <em>cells</em> on a spectacular <em>cliff</em>-top facing out to sea.		
隆		hump	"This character, used for everything from little <b>humps</b> of hills to camel <b>humps</b>, easily suggests the hunch on the pig's back and hind parts where the best cuts of meat are to be found (and hence the English expression for luxury, ""living high off the hog."") The elements we have to work with are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i> . . . <i>cell</i>."		11	1682	1561	40	リュウ		You are struggling to the top across the<strong> hump</strong>s, but you suddenly see the <em>pinnacle</em> and you feel new <em>life</em> in your <em>walking legs</em>.	A woman takes her <em>bra</em> off and what happens? Nine months later the<strong> hump</strong> in her belly pops out between her <em>legs</em> as a new <em>life</em>.	I climbed to the pinnacle with my girlfriend and we immediately got to making life between her legs (humping).	<em>The Pinnacle</em>, this perfect place, did have one person with a<strong> hump</strong> on his back. Poor guy spent his whole <em>life</em> aimlessly walking around the Pinnacle, without finding anyone to relate to.	The<strong> hump</strong> of a camel is actually a separate animal resting on top of the camel. It has its own <em>walking legs</em> and its own <em>life</em>. These animals are great as pets but are very expensive. A resident of <em>The Pinnacle</em> has bought one of the expensive pets - a<strong> hump</strong> with <em>walking legs</em> and a <em>life</em> of its own - and is walking it home from the pet store.		
峰		summit	Mountain . . . walking legs . . . bushes.		10	1683	1562	40	ホウ	みね、ね	"""Walking legs"" over ""bushes"" needs to have a primitive meaning of its own. It appears in several kanji, such as 縫 <a href=""../v4/1563.html"">sew</a> (#1563 縫), 逢 <a href=""../v4/2417.html"">tryst</a> (#2417 逢), 蜂 <a href=""../v4/2687.html"">bee</a> (#2687 蜂), and 鋒 <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2768"">sword’s point</a> (#2768 鋒), and it is clumsy to work bushes and walking legs into every story. ""Pointy"" works fairly well: the walking legs are stuck on top of the pointy part of the bush; and for this character: a <strong>summit</strong> is the <em>pointy</em> end of a <em>mountain</em>."	Moses climbs to the<strong> summit</strong> of the mountain using his walking legs to talk to the burning bush.	"If you are using the ""walking legs + bushes = pubic hair"" primitive… The nudist colony was banished to the top of the mountain's<strong> summit</strong>, so that nobody would have to see their bushes again!"	"Like in the next frame, the right side element is ""walking through bushes"". This time they're not on the road, but on a mountain, whose<strong> summit</strong> you're trying to reach. (the element will come in at least 逢 again)."	<em>Bush</em> between <em>walking legs</em> = <em>pubic hair</em>!		
蜂		bee	Insect . . . walking legs . . . bushes.		13	1684	2687	40	ホウ	はち	"A <strong>bee</strong> is an <em>insect</em> with a <em>pointy</em> (see <a href=""../v4/1562.html"">summit</a> (#1562 峰)) stinger."	I got stung by an <em>insect walking through the bushes</em>, I think it was a <strong>bee</strong>.	"Many people think<strong> bee</strong>s are insects with fur. But that is not correct! The ""fur"" is actually the <em>pubic hair</em> (<em>bush</em> under <em>walking legs</em>)."	"The <em>insect</em> that interrupted our <a href=""../v4/2417.html"">tryst</a> (#2417 逢) was a<strong> bee</strong>!"	Most people don't know that the hair covering a <strong>bee</strong> (<em>insect</em>) isn't fur, but actually <em>pubic hair</em>. Little known fact.		
縫		sew	Thread . . . walking legs . . . bushes . . . road.		16	1685	1563	40	ホウ	ぬ.う	"Good thing I brought some <em>thread</em>, cause I need to<strong> sew</strong> my pants that I tore up <em>walking through the bushes</em> (see <a href=""../v4/1562.html"">summit</a> (#1562 峰)) before we hit the <em>road</em> to go back down the mountain."	<em>Spiderman</em> while <em>walking through bushes</em> chasing a villain, rips his suit and stops on the road to<strong> sew</strong> it up.	"<em>Spider man</em> has to<strong> sew</strong> a new costume. He slipped while web swinging and fell on a bunch of <em>pointy</em> stuff in the <em>road</em>. Ouch! (See Mcfate's <a href=""../v4/1562.html"">summit</a> (#1562 峰) story for the ""pointy"" primitive)."	"<em>Spiderman</em> has to<strong> sew</strong> his spider suit after the <em><a href=""../v4/2417.html"">tryst</a> (#2417 逢)</em> last night. (He had to keep his suit on during the tryst to keep his anonymity)."	"After a 逢 <a href=""../v4/2417.html"">tryst</a> (#2417 逢), they will <strong>sew</strong> a scarlet letter to your clothes with red <em>thread</em>. Or at least, that's how it used to be done."		
拝		worship	<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>bush</i> . . . suspended from the <i>ceiling</i>.		8	1686	1564	40	ハイ	おが.む、おろが.む	I put my <em>fingers</em> together in<strong> worship</strong> of the <em>bush</em> that hangs from the <em>ceiling</em> – that wonderful mistletoe which has gotten me kissed by many a girl.	Because I<strong> worship</strong> her, I only finger ONE BUSH, her's, and no others!	"Imagine a weird cult where you hang a <em>bush from the ceiling</em> and then point at it with one <em>finger</em> saying ""<em>Bush</em>, <em>bush</em>, <em>bush</em>, I<strong> worship</strong> the bush!""."	PRESIDENT BUSH thought that coming to power would cause people to<strong> WORSHIP</strong> him, but now that his approval rating is so low, people just give him the FINGER and hang BUSH-pinatas from the CEILING to hit with bats.	Some people<strong> worship</strong> George <em>Bush</em>. I'd like to hang him from the <em>ceiling</em> and give him the <em>finger</em>.		
寿		longevity	Bushes . . . glue.		7	1687	1565	40	ジュ、ス、シュウ	ことぶき、ことぶ.く、ことほ.ぐ	This old China man <em>glued</em> <em>shrubs</em> to his body. The added intake of oxygen from the <em>shrubs</em> was, according to him, the secret of his<strong> longevity</strong>. Sometimes he would sit all day in meditation without moving, and the locals believed the old man had actually turned into a <em>shrub</em> !	To ensure<strong> longevity</strong> of her virginity, Alice applied a thick layer of <em>glue</em> on her <em>bush</em>.	In an attempt to increase a <em>bush's</em><strong> longevity</strong>, an incompitent gardener <em>glues</em> all the leaves back on that have fallen off. Maybe he should have tried watering it instead.	"The only reason ""President Bush"" has had such<strong> longevity</strong> in the white house is all the people under him who keep <em>gluing</em> his presidential career back together."	Increase the<strong> longevity</strong> of a <em>bush</em> by sticking the fallen leaves back on with <em>glue</em>.		
鋳		casting	<i>Metal</i> . . . <i>longevity</i>. As you probably guessed from the elements, the key word refers to the <b>casting</b> of metals.		15	1688	1566	40	チュウ、イ、シュ、シュウ	い.る	They made a <em>metal</em><strong> casting</strong> of the Chinese man who <em>glued</em> <em>shrubs</em> to himself to increase his <em>longevity</em>. It's now sold around the world as it's thought that having one will increase your own <em>longevity.</em>.	You make a<strong> casting</strong> of your baby's shoes in <em>gold</em> to ensure the <em>longevity</em> of the experience.	We take a <strong>casting</strong> because <em>metal</em> will have much greater <em>longevity</em> than the original.	<strong>Casting</strong> things in <em>metal</em> improves their <em>longevity</em>.	I have a problem with <em>longevity</em> so I need <em>Bush</em> in this story too. Here das <em>Bush</em> is wanting a <em>metal</em><strong> casting</strong> made of him to guarantee his <em>longevity</em> - reminds me of the statue of Saddam that was pulled down.		
籍		enroll	Bamboo . . . Christmas tree . . . once upon a time.		20	1689	1567	40	セキ		<em>Once upon a time</em>, in order to <strong>enroll</strong> in a Christian school you had to answer a series of questions to ensure that you were really Christian. For example, the principal might show you a picture of a <em>Christmas tree</em> and a picture of some <em>bamboo</em> and ask you which one is most suitable for decoration at Christmas time.	Japanese father<strong> enroll</strong>s his student in a well-rounded school: they teach eastern traditions (the way of the <em>bamboo</em>), western traditions (like <em>Christmas trees</em>), and also teach literature (<em>once upon a time</em>).	Once upon a time, Santa Claus visited Asia and left presents under bamboo Christmas trees for all the children who<strong> enroll</strong>ed in his Asian beta-testing…	Once upon a time, there was a little bamboo plant who tried to<strong> enroll</strong> as a Christmas tree.	<strong>Enroll</strong> in the class to make the BAMBOO- CHRISTMAS TREE that were made ONCE UPON A TIME. (セキ).		
春		springtime	Bonsai . . . sun.		9	1690	1568	40	シュン	はる	In the <strong>springtime</strong> <em>bonsai</em> get plenty of <em>sun</em>.	When it's<strong> springtime</strong> you can only leave the <em>bonsai</em> out when the <em>sun</em> has gone down. Their little leaves can't handle too much heat.	<strong>Springtime</strong> is the best season for Bonsai, because you can leave it out in the sun all day.	"A more simple Primitive than bonsai: <strong>3 people 三 ＋ 人 </strong> Springtime: <strong>3 people</strong> sitting enjoying the escape from winter, soaking in the <strong>sun</strong>.

椿		camellia	Tree . . . springtime.		13	1691	1569	40	チン、チュン	つばき	The <em>tree</em> of <em>spring</em>. Fact: <strong>Camellia</strong> are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter [early spring?].	Anyone who's lived in Japan knows <strong>camellia</strong> are by far the first tree of spring to flower. And how can you miss those shockingly pink flowers!	The<strong> camellia</strong> <em>tree</em> got its name from all the chameleons that cover every part of it during the <em>spring</em>.	The<strong> camellia</strong> is the <em>tree</em> which brings out its own <em>springtime</em>, even when it's not springtime, as it blooms around January.	"The<strong> camellia</strong> is the famous <em>tree</em> you see blooming in early <em>spring</em>, and also, the<strong> camellia</strong> is taken from its <em>tree</em> to be used in ""flowering tea,"" as a small way to bring <em>spring</em> into your tea breaks. —- Ways you've seen<strong> camellia</strong>s that may help memorization: the tree called C. Japonica is in the<strong> camellia</strong> family, flowering teas (where the tea in sewn to a<strong> camellia</strong> flower which ""blooms"" when brewed, and this kanji is read as つばき, which is a very common anime name. similar <a href=""../v4/927.html"">chrysanthemum</a> (#927 菊), <a href=""../v4/1210.html"">wisteria</a> (#1210 藤)."		
泰		peaceful	Bonsai . . . rice grains.		10	1692	1570	40	タイ		If you look into Japanese gardens they seem so<strong> peaceful</strong> - with their small bonsais and the white stones looking like rice grains.	"A monk pleads with an invading warrior not to destroy his people. ""We are a<strong> peaceful</strong> people,"" the monk pleads. ""Our monks spend all of their time tending to their harmless <em>bonsai trees</em>. And as for food, we require only a few <em>grains of rice</em>.""."	A <em>bonsai</em> with <em>rice</em> under it (to imitate a miniature white rock garden) is the epitome of a <strong>peaceful</strong> image.	I can't help but imagine a monk mediating under a bonsai tree, surviving only on a few grains of rice, seems so<strong> peaceful</strong>.	A more simple Primitive than bonsai: <strong>3 people 三 ＋ 人 </strong> Nothing more<strong> Peaceful</strong> than <strong>3 friends/people</strong> from different cultures exchanging ways to fix food.

奏		play music	Bonsai . . . heavens.		9	1693	1571	40	ソウ	かな.でる	When you<strong> play music</strong> to them, your <em>bonsai</em> will grow like they are in <em>heaven</em>.	In <em>heaven</em> you are surrounded by <em>bonsai</em> trees (full-sized ones fall through the clouds) while you<strong> play music</strong> on your harp. I always have trouble remembering that the bonsai tree is on top, so think of them growing on top of the clouds.	I<strong> play music</strong> to my <em>bonsai</em> to help it grow. Its favourite song is Stairway to <em>Heaven</em>.	When you<strong> play music</strong> to them, your <em>bonsai</em> will grow until they reach the HEAVENS.	The Japanese believe that when they die, they will go to a <em>heaven</em> with beautiful <em>bonzai</em> gardens and gentle <strong>music playing</strong>.		
実		reality	House . . . bonsai.		8	1694	1572	40	ジツ、シツ	み、みの.る、まこと、まことに、みの、みち.る	Bonsais are grown in a house, away from the harsh<strong> reality</strong> of the real world where they wouldn't survive.	On this rather boring 'big brother' type<strong> reality</strong> show, they have locked up <em>bonsai</em> inside a <em>house</em> and everyone is watching them on TV 24x7. The viewers have to vote on which bonsai shall remain in the house and which one has to leave.	(adapted from PepeSeco) In a new TV<strong> reality</strong> show called <em>bonsai</em> <em>house</em>, participants are challenged to grow the best bonsai. It takes years to make just one episode!	<em>Mr. Miyagi</em> is on a new<strong> reality</strong> TV show, <em>House of Miyagi</em>. 20 aspiring martial artists have to wash and clean an old house, while growing their own bonsai. Of course, their Bonsai don't come out very well, since they're novices. (I'm trying to differentiate this bonsai from the rest of the ones we've learned as being a messed up bonsai.. Notice the last stroke doesn't connect to the 2nd stroke of the kanji, but the 3rd instead.).	The<strong> reality</strong> is that most <em>bonsai</em> don't do well in the <em>house</em>.		
奉		dedicate	<i>Bonsai</i> . . . <i>cornstalk</i>. Use a ritualistic, religious meaning.		8	1695	1573	40	ホウ、ブ	たてまつ.る、まつ.る、ほう.ずる	To join the temple, you have to <strong>dedicate</strong> yourself to raising <em>bonsai</em> for enlightenment, and <em>cornstalks</em> for sustenance.	"A Japanese farmer who was growing <em>corn</em> tried to<strong> dedicate</strong> himself to the god of <em>corn</em> (in the hope it would bring better harvests). He had a little room with prayer beads, incense, etc. One day he brought an offerand that he thought would please the god of <em>corn</em> : a <em>bonsai - corn</em> (a <em>corn</em> plant turned into a <em>bonsai</em>). The god was infuriated and yelled at him ""HOW DARE YOU TORTURE MY CORN IN SUCH WAYS!"". The End."	"I used <em>does not equal</em> for the primitve(slant the line as a slash through the ""equals"" sign). Story: Decorating a <em>bonsai tree</em> for Christmas <em>does not equal</em> an <strong>observance</strong> of the real meaning of Christmas. Just like most people who<strong> dedicate</strong> themselves to appeasing the Credit Card gods for Christmas. Just <em>dosen't equal</em> the Christmas I know of."	You have to be really<strong> dedicate</strong>d to make a <em>bonsai tree</em> out of a <em>cornstalk</em>.	Once a year, the Japanese decorate bonsai trees with miniature cornstalks, and<strong> dedicate</strong> them to the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan. (For the record, I completely made that up, and I don't think corn has anything to do with Ainu, except that it reminds me of natives).		
俸		stipend	Person . . . dedicate.		10	1696	1574	40	ホウ		<em>Mr. T</em> gets a <strong>stipend</strong> every month if he stays <em>dedicated</em> to his temple training, a very hard thing for the impatient T.	People who are highly dedicated to their jobs get good salaries/stipends.

A<strong> stipend</strong>, in English at least, has a connotation of only a small regular payment. Despite a life of <em>dedication</em>, <em>P</em> has to go back to a simple life of tending to <em>bonsai</em> and growing <em>corn</em> after he retires with only a small monthly<strong> stipend</strong>."	Mr. T triked the botanic intruction institute into thinking that he dedicated his whole like in bonsai and corn research. He even manage to get a<strong> stipend</strong> from that institute. In fact he's not dedicated at all when it comes to bonsai or corn… he only water them once in a while.	The<strong> stipend</strong> is given to a <em>person</em> who is very <em>dedicated</em> to his bonsai art so he can study more.		
棒		rod	Tree . . . dedicate.		12	1697	1575	40	ボウ		Ha! If you know anything about Buddhist monks, during meditation, they're slapped with <em>wooden</em> <strong>rod</strong>s to stay <em>dedicated</em> to their task.	The wood from this <em>tree</em> is <em>dedicated</em> to making <strong>rods</strong> to flog naughty kids.	"After crafting his<strong> rod</strong> from the finest <em>tree</em> in the land, Moses broke into a battle rap. ""I <em>dedicate</em> this <em>rod</em>/ To the all mighty God!""."	A<strong> rod</strong> is a piece of <em>wood</em> that is <em>dedicated</em> to a particular purpose… (use your imagination).	I dedicate this tree… to<strong> rod</strong> stuart. fuck knows why.		
謹		discreet	Words . . . cabbage.		17	1698	1576	40	キン	つつし.む	Muttering words of gratitude for a wonderful meal, I<strong> discreet</strong>ly slipped my cabbage under the table for the dog.	<em>Cabbage</em> primitive: When a <em>cabbage</em> is <em>growing up</em>, you must put it in your <em>mouth</em> before it <em>flowers</em>, because that's when it becomes bitter. Seriously, it's called 'bolting' or something. When you're<strong> discreet</strong>, you try to make your <em>words</em> like a <em>cabbage</em>: well-layered, but in an unassuming way.	"HOW TO REMEMBER CABBAGE: it's the flower that is shoved in your mouth while you are growing up (parents force feed you cabbage), note how the ""grow up"" primitive is pushed into the mouth primitive overlapping. ""Muttering words of gratitude for a wonderful meal, I<strong> discreet</strong>ly slipped my cabbage under the table for the dog.""."	Be<strong> discreet</strong> and don't say to old people that their heads look like cabbages, even if they're all wrinkles.	Instead of cabbage here I see the Piranha Plant from Super Mario bros. It's a flower with a mouth and it grows up out of a pipe! Seems to make sense to me. But instead of regular Mario you have Socrates! So here is what is going on. Two Piranha Plants are<strong> discreet</strong>ly discussing when they will come up out of their pipes to hit Socrates. They have to talk<strong> discreet</strong>ly however becuase Socrates is standing right next to their pipes.

The <em>person</em> was such a nerd to concern himself with<strong> trifle</strong>s such as that the cauliflower is really a <em>cabbage</em> with <em>twenty flowers</em>.	"To a big guy like <em>Mr. T</em>, eating a whole <em>cabbage</em> at once is nothing. ""What? a <em>cabbage?</em> That's just a <strong>trifle</strong>, foo, where's the meat?""."

The school cafeteria manager decided, on her own initiative, to remove all <em>cabbage</em> from the school menu. This resulted in weakened students with poor <em>muscles</em>. Angry parents sued the manager. The main argument was that the manager did not show due<strong> diligence</strong> in researching the effects on <em>muscles</em> of removing <em>cabbage</em> from the diet."	With enough <strong>diligence</strong>, Koreans can turn ordinary <em>cabbage</em> into <em>powerful</em> kimchi.	Bodybuilder<strong> diligence</strong>: Eat <em>cabbage</em>. Build <em>muscles</em>.

漢		Sino-	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>scarecrow</i>.

"Take the left to be ""kanji"" not scarecrow.<strong> Sino-</strong> (Chinese) people had to put a lot of sweat into learning the kanji. See the drops of sweat coming off."	<em>Kanji</em> came from across the <em>water</em>, on the<strong> Sino-</strong> side of things.	This is the character you have on the left top of this website ;-).	"<strong>Sino-</strong> (Chinese) people had to put a lot of <em>sweat/water</em> into learning the <em>kanji</em>.

It is<strong> difficult</strong> to get back into the <em>kanji</em> learning groove again after going cold <em>turkey</em> for a month or so.	"The <em>Scarecrow</em> is trying to scare some <em>turkeys</em>, but they all just ignore him.

Think about how<strong> difficult</strong> it would be for a turkey!		
華		splendor	Flower . . . silage . . . needle.		10	1704	1581	40	カ、ケ	はな	The Queen of England taking a walk round a village: 'Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing the <strong>splendour</strong> of the <em>flowers</em> in your garden. Simply splendid. <em>Ten</em> out of ten.' The villager gruffly replies: 'No it 'aint. It's all muck. An' I'm gonna cut it all down and sell it to the farmer for <em>silage</em>.'.	Hint:<strong> Splendor</strong> in the Grass. Compare with 草 . This is just a more <strong>splendid</strong> version of that kanji.	In all its<strong> splendor</strong> a delicate flower arose from the pile of silage on a single needle-think stem.	I couldn't find the <em>needle</em> in the heap of <em>silage</em> but was surprised to find a <em>flower</em> of great<strong> splendor</strong> growing there.	The tourist marvels at the<strong> splendor</strong> of the jungle <em>flowers</em>. Little does she know, the <em>crosshair</em> of a <em>needle</em>-gun is pointing right at her. (As a primitive <em>silage</em> can take the meaning '<strong>crosshair</strong>'… for blindingly obvious reasons).		
垂		droop	<i>A drop of</i> . . . <i>silage</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i> . . . <i>floor</i>. The character is written in the order of its elements.		8	1705	1582	40	スイ	た.れる、た.らす、た.れ、-た.れ、なんなんと.す	For an old man with a <em>walking stick</em>, even a <em>drop</em> of <em>silage</em> to carry on his back will make him <em>droop</em> low down to the <em>floor</em>.	Even a <em>drop</em> of <em>silage</em> is enough to make an old man with a <em>walking stick</em><strong> droop</strong> low down to the <em>floor</em>. (rgravina - fixed up order).	Imagine looking through the sight of a hitman's <em>crosshair</em>. The bullet hits, a <em>drop of</em> blood appears on the target's shirt. The target drops his <em>walking stick</em> and starts to<strong> droop</strong>… finally hitting the <em>floor</em>. (I take '<em>silage</em>' to mean '<em>crosshair</em>').	"Image: a poor shriveled old lady struggling with a ""droop""ing load of <em>silage</em> on her shoulders. A <em>bit</em> falls to the <em>ground</em> and she <em>droop</em>s a little further to pick it up."	Hint : as a primitive, I used the image of <em>Droopy</em> Dog, the cartoon character created by Tex Avery.		
唾		saliva	Mouth . . . droop.		11	1706	2165	40	ダ、タ	つば、つばき	When some people are sleeping, their <em>mouths</em> <em>droop</em> open, and<strong> saliva</strong> drips out.	"Easy to remember if you have read the manga -or watched the anime- 謎の彼女 X「なぞのかのじょX」(""Mysterious Girlfriend X""): a boy who falls in love with a classmate when he sees her dripping <strong>drool</strong> during a nap (BTW astridtops' story fits in perfectly). <strong>Note</strong>: The boy's name, <a href=""midori://search?text=%E6%A4%BF%E3%80%8C%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B0%E3%81%8D%E3%80%8D"">椿「つばき」</a> <a href=""../v4/1569.html"">camellia</a> (#1569 椿), is a wordplay: it's one of the ways you can pronounce this kanji ( 唾き )."	<em>Droopy</em> the dog with<strong> saliva</strong> drooling from his <em>mouth</em>.

錘		spindle	Metal . . . droop.		16	1708	1584	40	スイ	つむ、おもり	Wasn't it a cursed<strong> spindle</strong> that Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on? Therefore the<strong> spindle</strong> was the <em>metal</em> that caused her to <em>droop</em> and eventually sleep for 100 years.	<strong>Spindle</strong>: the needle that drops on an LP record player. This is made of metal. It droops. Viola.	Think of a <strong>plumb bob</strong> rather than <strong>spindle</strong> (which are the same shape, and this kanji means both). It's a perfectly literal kanji: <em>droop</em>ing <em>metal</em>.	Once people could buy whole<strong> spindle</strong>s of CD-Roms for a few bucks, the number of <em>gold</em> records really started to <em>droop</em>.	I love this one! It's a classic cartoon episode! The theiving wolf takes the <em>golden</em> <strong>spindle</strong>. Then <em>Droopy Dog</em> takes the <strong>spindle</strong> away from him, thwaks him on the head with it and rolls him up on it.		
乗		ride	The simplest way to remember this character is to find the sprig of <i>wheat</i> in it, hidden because it doubles up with one stroke of <i>silage</i>.		9	1709	1585	40	ジョウ、ショウ	の.る、-の.り、の.せる	It's a <em>hay</em> <strong>ride</strong>! You sit on piles of <em>silage</em> and everyone likes to imitate old-time farmers with a piece of <em>wheat</em> sticking out of their mouths.	[ride; power; multiplication; record; counter for vehicles; board; mount; join] In the near future, we hope to <strong>ride</strong> on biomass fueled vehicles. Good news for those who have <em>wheat</em> <em>silage</em> surplus.	"The hardest part about being a farmer is when it comes to the slaughter. ""Come on boys, we're going for a<strong> ride</strong>!"" ""Oh boy, a<strong> ride</strong>!"" say the little <em>wheat</em> sprigs, hopping onto the tractor. The farmer then takes them off to become <em>silage</em>, tears in his eyes."	"On a farm first you <strong>ride</strong> the tractor, cut down the <em>wheat</em>, and finally mix the wheat with <em>silage</em> to make haylage. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haylage"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haylage</a>."	The closest the kids on the farm ever got to a fairground<strong> ride</strong> was pointing the <em>crosshair</em> of their air-rifles at the <em>wheat</em> to see who could take the head off first. (I take '<em>silage</em>' to mean '<em>crosshair</em>')… (<em>continued in next kanji</em>).		
剰		surplus	Ride . . . saber.		11	1710	1586	40	ジョウ	あまつさえ、あま.り、あま.る	If you go for a <em>ride</em> and find a <em>saber</em> beside you, perhaps you got into an Army<strong> surplus</strong> jeep.

We got a <strong>surplus</strong> of people on the <em>hayride</em>. <em>Chop</em> 'em off.	If there is a<strong> surplus</strong> of people on the <em>ride,</em> they may just need to get rid of a few passengers using a <em>saber</em>.	Hey, wanna take a <em>ride</em> with me to the Army<strong> surplus</strong> store to buy a <em>saber</em>?		
今		now	The final stroke of this kanji is a rare shape, which we have not met before and will only meet in this character and others that include it as a primitive. We are more accustomed to seeing it straightened out as part of other shapes - for instance, as the second stroke of <i>mouth</i>. If you need any help at all with this character, you may picture it as two hands of a clock pointing to what time it is <b>now</b>. The element above it, <i>meeting</i>, should easily relate to that image.	* We shall use <i>clock</i> as the primitive meaning of this character, in line with the above explanation.	4	1711	1587	41	コン、キン	いま	My MEETING is at 7- but that's<strong> NOW</strong>!	(re: ruuku35) The <em>meeting</em> is not at <em>quarter to seven</em> but<strong> now</strong>!	"<em>Doc Brown</em> (primitive) from Back to the Future checks his watch. The meeting with Marty McFly and Biff is <strong>now</strong>. ""Great Scott."" He's late, so he cuts a corner sharply in the DeLorean. It's such a sharp turn that it's found in no other kanji. Only Doc can pull it off."	"Looks like a ラ　with a hat. Like a cowboy saying ""Raaat<strong> now</strong>, pardner.""."	The <em>meeting</em> is<strong> now</strong>, <em>6:45</em>, according to the <em>hands of clock</em>.		
含		include	Clock . . . mouth.		7	1712	1588	41	ガン	ふく.む、ふく.める	This clock<strong> include</strong>s a mouth that will tell you what the time is now. Hearing impaired people have this kind of watches… now imagine them as a big mouth under the clock.	Batteries<strong> include</strong>d with this <em>clock</em>. Open the <em>mouth</em> at the back and insert them after purchase.	"#include < <em>time</em>.h >, < <em>stdio</em>.h >//or <em>clock</em>.h , <em>mouth</em>.h."	"(Based on erikkusan's story) For today's urban professionals – who are so busy that they don't even have time to look at their watch – this <em>clock</em><strong> include</strong>s a <em>mouth</em> that will announce the time. Picture the clock; it's in the shape of a face, so the mouth is at the bottom. That should keep it distinct from <a href=""../v4/1589.html"">versify</a> (#1589 吟)."	If you want to be<strong> include</strong>d in the gang, NOW is the time to open your MOUTH and say so.		
貪		covet	Clock . . . shellfish.		11	1713	3023	41	タン、 トン	むさぼ.る	"""Gimme all your <em>money</em> <em>now</em>!"" said the <strong>covet</strong>ous criminal."	One begins one's life <strong>coveting</strong> <em>money</em>. One ends one's life <strong>coveting</strong> time – those precious seconds ticking away on the <em>clock</em>. Remember to always put time over money (in this kanji and in life).	<strong>Covet</strong>. One can <strong>covet</strong> <em>money</em>. Money can buy a lot but it cannot buy time. Presiding above all, watch the <em>clock</em> ticking… a countdown to one's grave!	Here it shows the two most<strong> covet</strong>ed things. Time and money. You know time is money. Besides people go to work, deceive, kill etc to get money and time goes on top because it's<strong> covet</strong>ed the most. One would buy time when near death but you can. Many have been looking for the elixir of life but they failed. And they go together because many would despise a life without any money.	<strong>Covet</strong> <em>time</em> over <em>money</em>, for <em>money</em> cannot buy <em>time</em>, as the <em>clock</em> keeps ticking.		
吟		versify	As we have already learned characters for <i>poem</i> (Frame 370), <i>chant</i> (Frame 21), and <i>song</i> (Frame 508), it is important to protect this key word with an image all its own. Its elements are the same as those above; only the position has changed: <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>clock</i>.		7	1714	1589	41	ギン		A rapper is trying to <strong>versify</strong>, but sucks: Hickery dickery dock, the <em>mouth</em> spat out the <em>clock</em>. I'm gonna shoot you with my glock, if you don't suck my cock! <strong>Versify</strong>!	To<strong> versify</strong>, words of rhythm needs to shoot out of your MOUTH with a CLOCK-like regularity.	Just imagine a rapper using his <em>mouth</em> to <strong>versify</strong> with a big <em>clock</em> around his neck.	On the left-wing, people <em>mouth</em> about de<strong>versifying</strong>, but on the right, they want to turn back the <em>clock</em>.	<strong>Versify</strong> this kanji as follows: Hickery dickery dock, the <em>mouth</em> ran by the <em>clock</em>.		
念		wish	Clock . . . heart.		8	1715	1590	41	ネン		Someone<strong> wish</strong>ing from the bottom of their heart that the clock would stop. A mid-life crisis perhaps.	Remember in the Wizard of Oz when the tin man <strong>wished</strong> for a <em>heart</em> and the wizard gave him that dinky little <em>clock</em> instead?	A<strong> wish</strong> is something that your heart desires right now.	I<strong> wish</strong> with all my <em>heart</em> that I knew all the kanji <em>now</em>. This studying sucks!	I<strong> wish</strong> the <em>clock</em> would give me more time to do the things that my <em>heart</em> desires the most.		
捻		wrench	This kanji does not refer to the tool but to the act of twisting. Its elements: <i>fingers</i> . . . <i>wish.</i>		11	1716	2251	41	ネン、ジョウ	ね.じる、ねじ.る、ひね.くる、ひね.る	Ever try<strong> WRENCHING</strong> a bolt with just your FINGERS? Trust me, you'll WISH you had a wrench for<strong> WRENCHING</strong> to save your FINGERS.	"""I <em>wish</em> you would accept our friendly offer"", the mob guy said, as he started<strong> wrenching</strong> my <em>fingers</em> one by one."	I have an unfortunate habit of<strong> wrenching</strong> off other people’s <em>fingers</em> when I pull a <em>wish</em>bone with them.	The keyword refers to twirling or spinning something. Use your fingers the spin the hands on the clock wishing it would turn 5 and you can go home.	After your <em>finger</em> got <strong>wrenched</strong> in the lathe, you only have one <em>wish</em>: a new finger.		
琴		harp	A pair of <i>jewels</i> . . . <i>clock</i>.		12	1717	1591	41	キン	こと	Two <em>kings</em> were fighting over a beautiful koto (harp). So they had a <em>clock</em> built into it that would measure how long each one played it. That way they could be sure none played it more than othe other.	The <em>two kings</em> want to hear a<strong> harp</strong> right <em>now</em>!!	A pair 0f <em>kings</em> exchange gifts: a <em>clock</em> and a <strong>harp(koto)</strong>.	Two <em>kings</em> were fighting over a beautiful koto (harp). So they had a <em>clock</em> built into it that would measure how long each one played it. That way they could be sure none played it more than othe other.<em> (It helps me to remember that the kings are sitting atop the giant floor clock staring down in anticipation. for placement)</em>.	This is actually the kanji for <strong>koto</strong>. I pictute two mallets with <em>jeweled</em> heads beating on a <strong>koto</strong> in time to a metronome (<em>clock</em>).		
陰		shade	Just as the <i>sunshine</i> (Frame 1397) represents the masculine principle in nature (Yang), the <b>shade</b> stands for the feminine principle (Yin). Its elements are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>clock</i> . . . <i>rising cloud</i>.		11	1718	1592	41	イン	かげ、かげ.る	The only <strong>shade</strong> at <em>The Pinnacle</em> is in the shadow of the giant <em>clock</em> tower, or from a <em>rising cloud</em>.	Frosty the snowman is running around the pinnacle, staying in the<strong> shade</strong>. As he looks at his clock to see how much longer he can last, small clouds rise (steam) from his body. Nooo, Frosty!	The <em>pinnacle</em> is in the<strong> shade</strong>, because it has <em>now</em> become <em>cloudy</em>.	"To avoid the confusion with <a href=""../v4/1712.html"">shadow</a> (#1712 影), let's use a rhyme : At <em>The Pinnacle</em>, the only <strong>shade</strong> / is that of thinks that are man-made (The giant <em>clock</em> tower, and the <em>rising cloud</em> from a factory)."	You are now 75% of the way through the 2136 joyo kanji!		
予		beforehand	Think of this character as identical to the <i>halberd</i> (Frame 1311) except that the final stroke has been omitted. Return to that character and devise some image to take this difference into account.		4	1719	1593	41	ヨ、シャ	あらかじ.め	<strong>Beforehand</strong>, this was a <em>halberd</em> but I cut it short so it could <strong>be for hand</strong> to hand combat.	Your <em>halberd</em> doesn't have a handguard? You should have thought of that<strong> beforehand</strong> (i.e., before you were missing your hand).	This is the halberd<strong> beforehand</strong>, i mean: before you draw the hand (the last stroke of halberd).	Be sure to check your <em>halberd</em><strong> beforehand</strong> to make sure it's not missing its final stroke.	As others see it, think of<strong> BEFOREHAND</strong> with Forehand, which easily reminds you of a tennis racket for use as a primitive in later kanji. It even looks like a tennis racket, so all the better.		
序		preface	Cave . . . beforehand.		7	1720	1594	41	ジョ	つい.で、ついで	The<strong> preface</strong> to all human history was written <em>beforehand</em> in <em>caves</em>.	"Rename the ""beforehand"" part to be <em>glove</em> (because you have to wear <em>gloves</em> beforehand if you want to wield the halberd, which is why this primitive is an incomplete halberd). The story: a winter morning. A textbook author is holed up in his tiny office, a veritable <em>cave</em>. He wants to start his masterpiece textbook by first writing the<strong> preface</strong>. But he can't get started. He sits and stares at empty paper until evening. It gets cold and he puts on <em>glove</em>s, shivering, but still unable to start his<strong> preface</strong>."	In the<strong> preface</strong> to his latest edition of RTK, Heisig tells us that until he invented his brilliant kanji-learning method, he was living in a <em>cave beforehand</em>. Luckily, the publishing of the book gave him enough money to move out of the <em>cave</em> into an apartment. He could also finally afford to put a handle on his <em>halberd</em>.	Read<strong> preface</strong> on the <em>cave beforehand</em> or you'll be sorry…	I suck at <em>tennis</em> so I picked up a book by Roger Federer. The<strong> preface</strong> tells how he was so awesome that he managed to defeat a <em>cave wall</em> in a one-on-one <em>tennis</em> match. The cave wall eventually gave up and collapsed. The rest of the book was about boring <em>tennis</em> strategies.		
預		deposit	Beforehand . . . head.		13	1721	1595	41	ヨ	あず.ける、あず.かる	<strong>Deposit</strong>ing money into your savings account is something you do <em>beforehand</em> if you use your <em>head</em>. If you're in Japan your passbook says 預金機 （よきんき）when you make a<strong> deposit</strong>.	You bang your <em>head</em> on the ATM, wishing you'd<strong> deposit</strong>ed some money <em>beforehand</em>.	預血 means to<strong> deposit</strong> blood in a blood bank. Imagine bringing a severed <em>head</em> to the blood bank for a blood<strong> deposit</strong>. Of course, you are wearing <em>gloves</em> when handling the bloody <em>head</em>.	(RPG) All of you who enjoy playing RPGs every now and then should be familiar with this. When you accept a risky quest like hunting for the <em>head</em> of some evil monster. You should<strong> deposit</strong> your money (<em>shells</em>) <em>beforehand</em>, so that when you die you don't lose all of your wealth.	In Japan, instead of sending your statements in the mail, you are given a small book that you can insert into the ATMs and all activity will be printed inside. One of the few good things that Japanese banks do. When<strong> deposit</strong>ing money at an ATM, you must open your book to the right <em>page</em> and insert <em>beforehand</em> to have a record of the<strong> deposit</strong> written in.		
野		plains	This character refers to rustic life and rustic fields primarily, and from there gets derived meanings. Its elements: <i>computer</i>. . <i>beforehand</i>.		11	1722	1596	41	ヤ、ショ	の、の-	These days we all work in front of computers. Beforehand we all worked out in the fields, in the<strong> plains</strong>.	The <strong>plains</strong> are a challenging place to get any work done. Be sure you recharge your <em>computer's</em> battery <em>beforehand</em>, or you won't get anything done.	"In <em>windows XP</em>, if you don't change the background <em>beforehand</em>, it's that STUPID pitcure of<strong> plains</strong>. You ALL know what I'm talking about. <a href=""http://photos.codlib.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bliss_xp.jpg"">http://photos.codlib.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bliss_xp.jpg</a> Now that I look at it on Vista, I actually realized how pretty this place really is."	Think of<strong> plains</strong> in contrast to hills, mountains, and skyscrapers. A saboteur breaks into the military <em>computer</em> complex. Wearing <em>gloves</em> to avoid leaving fingerprints, he types a few codes into the <em>computer</em> that unleash the nuclear weapons on the target city. The target city, formerly a varied landscape of hills, mountains, and skyscrapers, is instantly flattened into level and barren landscape:<strong> plains</strong>.	If I'd checked Google maps on the <em>computer</em> <em>beforehand</em> I wouldn't be lost out on the<strong> plains</strong>.		
兼		concurrently	At the top we have <i>the animal horns</i> and the single horizontal stroke to give them something to hang onto. Below that, we see one <i>rake</i> with two handles. Finally, we see a pair of strokes splitting away from each of the handles, indicating that they are both splitting under the pressure. The composite picture is of someone holding down two jobs <b>concurrently</b>, using the same kit of tools to move in two different directions and ending up in a mess. Take the time to find this sense in the kanji and it will be easy to remember, despite initial appearances.		10	1723	1597	41	ケン	か.ねる、-か.ねる	Our ninja hero, disguised as a gardener with a <em>rake</em>, is suddenly attacked from both left and right<strong> concurrently</strong> by bulls with <em>animal horns</em>. Our hero lets out a blood-curdling scream and tears his rake handle vertically in half, so he now has two wooden staffs (<em>split rake handle</em>) to fight with. He grips each staff (left side and right side) and rams it into the horns of the charging bulls. The force of each charging bull causes the tips of each staff to split again (<em>split bottom of each rake handle</em>).	You decide to take the bull by the <em>horns</em> and do both chores<strong> concurrently</strong>, grabbing your <em>double-handled rake</em> before attempting to clean up both your's and your neighbours' garden. But unfortunately, it's not long until your <em>rake</em> <em>splits in two</em>.	Special <em>rake</em>, used to hold a bull by both <em>horns</em> <strong>concurrently</strong>. Two handles have V-like ends to set your arms against.	I'm going to use CASANOVA as the signal image here. A HORNY RAKE of a man who wants to date many women and/or men<strong> concurrently</strong>. The final four strokes, if you look carefully, turn the HORNY RAKE into a head on a body with arms open wide to embrace you. Run away!	<strong>Concurrently</strong> Primitive: Sarah Palin. She's<strong> concurrently</strong> Governor of Alaska and the vice presidential nominee. Quite a job. Some days she's shooting moose and mounting the <em>horns</em> on her wall. Other days she's being a maverick and <em>raking</em> up corruption in her own party. There's so much corruption she needs <em>two</em> rakes. She likes to do this all while wearing a <em>red skirt</em>. You can see the skirt flailing out on either side.		
嫌		dislike	Woman . . . concurrently.		13	1724	1598	41	ケン、ゲン	きら.う、きら.い、いや	Naturally, if you're dating more than one <em>woman</em> <em>concurrently</em>, they will certainly<strong> dislike</strong> each other!	Attempting to court two women concurrently will make them both<strong> dislike</strong> you.	WOMEN<strong> dislike</strong> CASANOVA because he dates more than one concurrently.	She'll<strong> dislike</strong> you if you have another <em>woman</em> <em>concurrently</em>.	<em>Women</em><strong> dislike</strong> men who date other <em>women</em> <em>concurrently</em>.		
鎌		sickle	Metal . . . concurrently.		18	1725	1599	41	レン、ケン	かま	This is a special<strong> sickle</strong> with metal blades on both sides. It can cut many things concurrently!	The <em>gold</em> <strong>sickle</strong> of the USSR flag represents both leaders and workers laboring <em>concurrently</em>.	The<strong> sickle</strong> was one of the choice weapons of the stealthy ninja. Made of sturdy <em>metal</em>, it could function <em>concurrently</em> as an apparently harmless farming tool, as well as a lethal weapon in combat, as well as a grappling hook. (True story).	Have you wondered why so many people can die at a particular instant when there's only one Grim Reaper? Wonder no more! He uses a magical <em>metal</em><strong> sickle</strong> that can kill mutiple people <em>concurrently</em>.	For Harvest Moon Players: You upgrade to a golden<strong> sickle</strong> that can cut lots of grass concurrently.		
謙		self-effacing	Words . . . concurrently.		17	1726	1600	41	ケン		When you are<strong> self-effacing</strong> you use words to concurrently bring yourself down and make yourself look better.	Try to compliment a Japanese person and they'll interrupt you by saying<strong> self-effacing</strong> <em>words concurrently</em>.	Though the man's <em>words</em> were<strong> self-effacing</strong>, his actions <em>concurrently</em> made it clear that his modesty was false.	This<strong> self-effacing</strong> guy always <em>speaks concurrently</em> with someone else. That is, he waits for someone to speak, then speaks at the same time. When the other person stops speaking he stops as well, thinking nobody noticed he was speaking, but having said aloud whatever he had to say anyway.	Say + Concurrently:<strong> Self-effacing</strong> people <em>say</em> little about their accomplishments even while they are <em>concurrently</em> working on multiple tasks.		
廉		bargain	Cave . . . concurrently.		13	1727	1601	41	レン		"Stores don't want you to know it, but if you find the secret <em>cave</em>, they run <strong>bargains</strong> there <em>concurrently</em> to their regular prices. (Image: pulling a certain level in a store to find the ""<strong>bargain</strong> <em>cave</em>)."	Think of the cave as a<strong> bargain</strong> basement, where shoppers rush in concurrently as soon as it opens.	With multiple sales going on <em>concurrently</em> in the same <em>cave</em>, you’re sure to find a<strong> bargain</strong>.	CASANOVA wanted to take you to a love hotel, but he loves a<strong> bargain</strong>; you ended up with CASANOVA in a CAVE.	"<a href=""Http://youtube.com/watch?v=hfvWz6IzoXw"">Http://youtube.com/watch?v=hfvWz6IzoXw</a> This clip says it all. The Filene's basement bi-annual wedding dress sale. This year's sale has moved to a <em>cave</em>. Hundreds of insane brides rushing in <em>concurrently</em> just for a<strong> bargain</strong>."		
西		west	To our way of counting directions, the <b>west</b> always comes fourth. So it is convenient to find the character for <i>four</i> in this kanji. But since we want only <i>one</i> of the <i>four</i> directions, the <b>west</b> adds the <i>one</i> at the top and sucks the <i>human legs</i> a bit out of their <i>mouth</i> in the process.	* As a primitive, the meaning of <i>west</i> can be expanded to refer to the <i>Old West</i> of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for <i>east</i> was expanded into <i>the East</i>. Note, however, that in its primitive form the <i>legs</i> are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the <i>mouth</i>. Hence, we get the shape ⻃. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives.	6	1728	1602	41	セイ、サイ、ス	にし	"The old<strong> west</strong> represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare <a href=""../v4/1427.html"">sign of the bird</a> (#1427 酉) whiskey bottle about one third full)."	Note: this kanji is also used to denote Spain.	The Spaghetti <strong>Western</strong> movies, typified by <em>empty bottles of whisky</em>, were so-called because it was often an Italian director that shot them. Most of these films however, were actually shot in <strong>Spain</strong> (another meaning this kanji holds).	Only <em>one</em> out of every <em>four</em><strong> west</strong>erns is worth watching. Even that's debatable. The rest are crap.	<em>One</em> of the <em>four</em> directions: The<strong> West</strong>.		
価		value	Person . . . Old West.		8	1729	1603	41	カ、ケ	あたい	"Mr. T has a high<strong> value</strong> in the Old West because you see him in ""Wanted"" posters all over the place! (thanks fiminor)."	"What might it mean for a <em>person</em> in the <em>old west</em> to be of<strong> value</strong>? Their face is on a ""Wanted!"" poster, of course. Imagine the reward…"	Mr T is highly<strong> value</strong>d in the West.	You wanna know the <strong>value</strong>? To know its <strong>value</strong>, consult <em>Mr. T</em>, who, surprisingly, is an expert in <em>old west</em> artifacts. He'll tell you the <strong>value</strong>.	A <em>jedi</em> went back in time to the <em>Old West</em>. His lightsaber made short work of bullets, so soon he was on Wanted posts everywhere, and his<strong> value</strong> was skyhigh!		
要		need	Old West . . . woman.		9	1730	1604	41	ヨウ	い.る	(ヨウ) When Clint<strong> need</strong>s a woman, he likes to be on top.	In the <em>Old West</em>, <em>women</em> were<strong> need</strong>ed because nobody knew how to cook or clean.	In some movie with the theme of the <em>Old West</em>, the population of a town finds themselve in dire<strong> need</strong> of <em>women</em>, after all of the town's <em>womens</em> became crazy and started gunshooting and participating in duels and such.	"<em>Old West</em>ern drunkard in a saloon in a town of men (cowboys, gold panners, blacksmiths, etc), ""I <strong>need</strong> me a <em>woman</em>! Get over here, boy, you'll have to do.""."	In the <em>old west</em> the<strong> need</strong>s of a <em>woman</em> were always at the bottom.		
腰		loins	Part of the body . . . need.		13	1731	1605	41	ヨウ	こし	"If you want to get closer to the actual meaning, then I think that 腰 (こし) is more like the hips or the small of the back. After being sat down in the office too long, people often say <a href=""midori://search?text=%E8%85%B0%E3%81%8C%E3%81%84%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84%EF%BC%81"">腰がいたい！</a> It's the <em>part of the body</em> that <em>needs</em> massaging."	"To the puritans reading this site - please stop reporting stories that have anything to do with sex! Although (as wrightak said) this kanji really refers to the hips, Heisig clearly chose the keyword 'loins' because it was anatomically close enough, and the primitives lent themselves to an easy-to-remember story. Just because you're all sexually repressed doesn't mean other people won't benefit from a story such as ""the <em>part of the body</em> people <em>need</em> more than any other are the<strong> loins</strong>""."	My <strong>loins</strong> ache! They <em>need</em> some <em>flesh</em>!	"The <em>body part</em> that has more ""<em>needs</em>"" than any other is the<strong> loins</strong>."	<strong>Loin</strong> clothes cover up the <em>part of the body</em> that really <em>needs</em> to be covered up.		
票		ballot	Old West . . . altar.		11	1732	1606	41	ヒョウ		In the Old West there were no<strong> ballot</strong> boxes. Afraid of fraud and fighting among the gunslingers, the<strong> ballot</strong>s were posted into a slot in the top of the local church altar instead. They may have been rough, but the cowboys wouldn't fight in the church.	In <em>western</em> political elections (US), peoples <strong>ballots</strong> will often depend on religion and at which <em>altar</em> the prospective president prays.	In the <em>West</em> we <em>show</em> our opinion through the<strong> ballot</strong> box.	"Clint eastwood and alter. Here clint eastwood imposes law and order. Teh first thing he does is to hold a vote ""But we dont have a<strong> ballot</strong> box"". clint punches a hole in the altar and says "" you do now!"" (imagine him standing over the altar and punching down kinda like karata guy would)."	Even in the <em>Old West</em>, the<strong> ballot</strong>s <em>showed</em> Obama winning.		
漂		drift	Water . . . ballot.		14	1733	1607	41	ヒョウ	ただよ.う	In Florida, Bush through Kerry's <em>ballots</em> into the <em>water</em>, watching them<strong> drift</strong> away and setting the whole country adrift.	The political fanatic stole all the <em>ballots</em> and dumped them in the <em>stream</em>. He calmly watched them <strong>drift</strong> away as the cops came to a screech behind him.	<strong>Drift</strong>ing on the <em>water</em> we held a <em>ballot</em> to decide who to kick off the raft.	Picture a<strong> drift</strong>ing lifeboat, <em>water</em> splashing over the side, and the occupants holding a <em>ballot</em> to decide who to eat next.	Not correctly understanding the process, I put my absentee ballot in a bottle and threw it in the ocean in hopes that it would<strong> drift</strong> back to the states.		
標		signpost	Tree . . . ballot.		15	1734	1608	41	ヒョウ	しるべ、しるし	<em>Trees</em> were frequenly used as <strong>signposts</strong> in those days, indicating where one had to go to cast their <em>ballots</em>.	"Large <em>wooden</em><strong> signpost</strong>s are planted on peoples lawns, with the faces of their representatives all saying: ""Vote [1] Me!"" for the upcoming <em>ballot</em>."	"The republicans attempted to rig the election by placing<strong> signpost</strong>s on a progression of trees saying ""democrat ballot boxes this way."" The last sign pointed to a cliff. Very funny, guys."	[Warning: Not a very nice story] There's a<strong> signpost</strong> up high in the <em>tree</em> that says where the blacks can cast their <em>ballots</em>. It's so high up, they cannot read it. (In the old West, blacks were able to vote, but prevented from doing so.).	"You always know there's a <em>ballot</em> coming up when <em>wooden</em><strong> signpost</strong>s start appearing everywhere saying ""vote for me!""."		
栗		chestnut	Old West . . . tree.		10	1735	1609	41	リツ、リ	くり、おののく	<strong>Chestnut</strong> tree, west nut tree.	The cowboy climbed the tree to see where they were in the woods. The poor guy chose a <strong>chestnut</strong> tree. ouch ouch.	Picture an <em>old western</em> cowboy on his front porch shooting <strong>chestnuts</strong> off his <strong>chestnut</strong> <em>tree</em>.	"One of the <em>trees</em> most common in the <em>Old West</em> was the<strong> chestnut</strong>. Not the <a href=""../v4/514.html"">horse chestnut</a> (#514 栃). They tried that first, but the horses spent all day eating those and they could never ride them."	Due to the great <strong>chestnut</strong> blight, since the time of the <em>old west</em> you just cannot find any more of these <em>trees</em>.		
慄		shudder	State of mind . . . chestnut.		13	1736	3024	41	リツ	おそ.れる、 おのの.く、 ふる.える	<strong>shudder</strong>: You’re in the state of mind of<strong> shudder</strong>ing with fear when the chestnut tree is falling over towards you.	<strong>Shudder</strong>. If <em>chestnut</em> trees were sentient, <strong>shudder</strong> would be their <em>state of mind</em> as the tree shaker approaches. Note: Tree shakers are used commercially to harvest nuts and cider apples. A tree shaker makes a tree <strong>shudder</strong> causing all the ripe <em>chestnuts</em> to fall.	<strong>shudder in fear</strong>: <em>Data</em> <strong>shudders in fear</strong> whenever he sees a <em>chestnut</em> because they look like tribbles.	Data, chestnut: Some pranksters were throwing <em>chestnuts</em> at <em>Data</em> who was passing by. However, they started to <strong>shudder</strong> in fear when suddenly <em>Data</em> turned around and his eyes turned red in anger!	"In a nostalgic state of mind, I bought some chestnuts from a street vendor in NYC, only to<strong> shudder</strong> when I realized ""these aren't chestnuts…""."		
遷		transition	West . . . St. Bernard dog . . . snake . . . road.		15	1737	1610	41	セン	うつ.る、うつ.す、みやこがえ	Since the days of the <em>Old West</em>, traveling has<strong> transition</strong>ed from trying not to step on <em>big snakes</em> to driving on <em>big roads</em>.	The <em>west</em> has gone through quite a<strong> transition</strong>, gone are the days when <em>dogs</em> and <em>snakes</em> roamed the desert, it's all <em>roads</em> and casinos now.	Going west on the road you will notice it<strong> transition</strong>s from a big highway to a snaking gravel road.	I was driving through the desert, west into the sun, wearing my<strong> transition</strong> light-to-dark glasses. They were too dark, and I accidentally hit a dog. When I got out to see if it was still alive, a rattlesnake bit me. Before I died I saw the dog hobble over and drive off with my car. As I made the<strong> transition</strong> between life and death, I scratched this kanji into the sand.	In Dragon Ball, the<strong> Transition</strong> after death occurs as follows: You go <em>West</em> on a <em>Big</em> <em>Serpent</em> <em>Road</em> (Snakeway) .. and, well, you keep going.

覆		capsize	West . . . restore.		18	1738	1611	41	フク	おお.う、くつがえ.す、くつがえ.る	The U.S.S. Old West has<strong> capsize</strong>d, and all the cowboys on board are trying to restore her upright.	Remember Oregon Trail? Remember how you had to float your wagon across rivers to get to the <em>Old West</em>? Well, sometimes that wagon<strong> capsize</strong>s. Once that happens you'd better quickly head to the nearest town to restore.	Many stories about the <em>old west</em> are arguably glorifying the wrong side - if properly <em>restored</em> to the truth, one would see the situation <strong>turned upside down</strong> (that is to say, <strong>capsized</strong>), with the natives heroically trying to fight off villainous foreign invaders.	On its journey WEST-ward, the cruise ship<strong> CAPSIZE</strong>D and was damaged so bad that they couldn't RESTORE it.	(Talka) The U.S.S. Old West was<strong> capsize</strong>d during the attack on Pearl Harbor. But it was later restored and used in the Pacific Theater.		
煙		smoke	Hearth . . . Old West . . . ground.		13	1739	1612	41	エン	けむ.る、けむり、けむ.い	In the <em>Old West</em>, they used to light <em>fires</em> in the <em>ground</em> to make<strong> smoke</strong> signals.	"Should be easy.<strong> SMOKE</strong> brings to mind ""Where there's<strong> SMOKE</strong>, there's FIRE"". So, the FIRE in the OLD WEST can tell people we're you're at, so put out the FIRE with SOIL to keep the<strong> SMOKE</strong> to a minimum."	In the <em>old west</em> people not only <em>fired</em> up and<strong> smoke</strong>d tobacco filling the air with its<strong> smoke</strong> but they chewed it too, spitting it on the <em>ground</em>.	Clint sits by the fire on the dirt, smoking his cigarillo, watching the<strong> smoke</strong> float up slowly. This is his ideal way to spend time.	They used to light <em>fires</em> in the <em>Old West</em> on the <em>ground</em> to make<strong> smoke</strong> signals.		
南		south	<i>Belt</i> . . . <i>happiness</i>. Note how the <i>belt</i> runs through the middle of <i>happiness</i>.		9	1740	1613	41	ナン、ナ	みなみ	<strong>South</strong> of my <em>belt</em> leads to <em>happiness</em>.	"In the<strong> south</strong> (Southern Alabama,<strong> South</strong>ern Africa, picture any<strong> south</strong>, but choose one and stick with it) ""they measure <em>happyness</em> by the <em>belt</em>"". If someone has a larger belly (and a longer <em>belt</em>), it is believed they are well fed and thus are <em>happy</em>."	"The<strong> South</strong> is characterized by the region known as the ""Bible <em>Belt</em>,"" which is so named because any <em>happiness</em> to be had there is <em>belted</em> down by ultra-conservative Evangelical Christian values."	Some people can only find <em>happiness</em> through the<strong> south</strong>ern regions below their <em>belt</em>.	A BELT cost 10 YEN in the<strong> SOUTH</strong>.		
楠		camphor tree	Tree . . . south.		13	1741	1614	41	ナン、ダン、ゼン、ネン	くす、くすのき	We traveled to <em>southern</em> Japan just to see a<strong> camphor tree</strong>. It's what we <strong>came for</strong>.	Trivia: Cinnamomum <em>camphora</em> is native to Taiwan, <strong>southern</strong> Japan, <strong>south</strong>east China and Indochina,.	<strong>Camphor tree</strong> + <em>south</em> = <em>Southern</em> Comfort (the liquor) <em>tree</em> (works for me).	<strong>Fact:</strong> The <strong>camphor</strong> is known for its effects on the man's sex drive and consequently it is used sometimes in the food served to soldiers. <strong>Story:</strong> you can think of the<strong> camphor tree</strong> as a <em>tree</em> that prevents <em>happiness</em> under the <em>belt</em>.	There is a <em>tree</em> in the <em>south</em> that legand has if you CAMP under it, you will be visited by a WHORE.		
献		offering	South . . . chihuahua.		13	1742	1615	41	ケン、コン	たてまつ.る	A <em>South</em> Korean street vendor is<strong> offering</strong> <em>chihuahu</em> snacks.	If you go to someones place and the food sucks, you lower it down <em>south</em> of the table as an<strong> offering</strong> to their <em>dog</em>.	KFC is<strong> offering</strong> southern fried chiwawa for a limited time only.

門		gates	The pictograph of two swinging <b>gates</b> is so clear in this kanji that only its stroke order needs to be memorized. In case you should have any trouble, though, you might doodle with the shapes on a piece of paper, taking care to note the difference in the stroke order of the two facing doors. The <b>gates</b> usually serve as an enclosure, and are written BEFORE whatever it is they enclose.	* As a primitive, we shall continue to give it the meaning of <i>gates</i>, but recommend the image of swinging doors (like the kind once common at entrances to saloons) to distinguish it from the primitive for <i>door</i>.	8	1743	1616	42	モン	かど、と	"Heisig's stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful – first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the ""sun"" attachment as you would normally. In fact, if you just wrote it out as two suns with elongated sides, you'll get the stroke order exactly correct."	The<strong> gates</strong> to Hell. guarded by Cerebus or … Bill<strong> Gates</strong>?	Bill<strong> Gates</strong> is just about to walk into a saloon.	The<strong> GATES</strong> of Hell make a great primitive for the following frames.	Primitives, Either<strong> gates</strong> to hell, or the pearly<strong> gates</strong> :D.		
問		question	Gates . . . mouth.		11	1744	1617	42	モン	と.う、と.い、とん	"A mouth on the Gates of Hell says ""Answer me these<strong> question</strong>s three, or thru the gates ye soon will be""."	You begin to<strong> question</strong> all of the <em>holes</em> Gates leaves in his software.	The mouth is the gate from which<strong> question</strong>s are asked.	To get access to Bill Gates' supermansion you have to answer several<strong> question</strong>s asked by a weird detached mouth at the entrance. Get a<strong> question</strong> wrong and the mouth will eat you.	"As you walk through the <em>saloon doors</em>, everyone shuts up and stares at you, <em>mouths</em> open… the barman asks the<strong> question</strong> on everyone's mind - ""Who the fuck are you son?""."		
閲		review	<i>Gates</i> . . . <i>devil</i>. Keep the connotation of this key word distinct from those of <i>inspection</i> (Frame 1174), <i>revise</i> (Frame 362), and <i>perusal</i> (Frame 919).		15	1745	1618	42	エツ	けみ.する	A little <em>devil</em> at the <em>gates of hell</em><strong> review</strong>s your record to see if you're evil enough to get in.	As I was <strong>reviewing</strong> for my exam at a quiet saloon, the <em>devil</em> popped out of nowhere and offered to make sure I pass. But I told him no way, since that's cheating. Besides, I'm just <strong>reviewing</strong> things I already know. I won't fail. But he kept insisting, so I kicked him and sent him crashing through the entrance <em>gates</em>.	<em>Gates'</em> IS the <em>devil</em>. He releases software that clearly hasn't gone through any kind of <em>review</em> process.	At the <em>gates</em> of Hell, the <em>Devil</em> greets you with his punishment: to<strong> review</strong> kanji flash cards for the rest of your life! (Not that I think anything is wrong with Heisig, but it does get tiring and I certainly wouldn't want to do it all my life. ;)).	"At the Gates of Hell: ""What did I do to get here?"" you ask in disbelief. ""Well, let's<strong> review</strong>…"" says Satan."		
閥		clique	Gates . . . fell.		14	1746	1619	42	バツ		You set a guard at the gate to fell intruders not of your<strong> clique</strong>.	The <em>felled</em> souls of the world, cut down like trees, pass through the <em>gates of hell</em> and join the <strong>clique</strong>.	A<strong> clique</strong> is a small exclusive group of people usually gathering around a leader or for a common purpose. Here we see <em>Mr. T</em>'s fan club meeting for a <em>fiesta</em> at a very select club called the 'Perly <em>Gates</em>'.	<em>Bill Gates</em> has been known to <em>fell</em> any rival software company that threatens his little<strong> clique</strong> at the top.	You only get through the <em>gates</em> into <em>that person's</em> <em>fiesta</em> if you are in the same<strong> clique</strong>.		
間		interval	<i>Gates</i> . . . <i>sun/day</i>. This <b>interval</b> applies to time and space alike, but the latter is better for creating an image.		12	1747	1620	42	カン、ケン	あいだ、ま、あい	The<strong> interval</strong> between star systems (<em>suns</em>) was too large, so the star<em>gates</em> were created to travel between them.	We open the <em>gates</em> at regular <strong>intervals</strong> to let a bit of <em>sun</em> in.	At regular<strong> interval</strong>s the gates of Hell burn like the sun keeping all within nice and toasty.<strong> Interval</strong> paining.	At almost regular<strong> interval</strong>s of a year or so, <em>Bill Gates</em> tries again to take on their rival <em>Sun</em> in the server market, and thankfully UNIX and Linux always prevail.	<em>Lesbians</em> do their thing on one <em>day</em><strong> interval</strong>s because their <em>gates</em> get so sore.		
闇		pitch dark	Gates . . . sound.		17	1748	2777	42	アン、オン	やみ、くら.い	Through the gates of hell there is no sound, no light, its all<strong> pitch dark</strong>.	In the<strong> pitch dark</strong>, I can hear the <em>sound</em> of the <em>lesbians</em> rubbing their <em>gates</em> together.	I like to think of a horror movie where the protagonists enter a graveyard when suddenly their flashlights go out and it becomes<strong> pitch dark</strong>, whereupon they hear the <em>sound</em> of the <em>gate</em> creaking shut behind them.	When it is <strong>pitch dark</strong>, you must navi<em>gate</em> by <em>sound</em>.	I opened the gates and it was<strong> pitch dark</strong>. Only a eerie sound could be heard.		
簡		simplicity	Bamboo . . . interval.		18	1749	1621	42	カン		The <strong>simplicity</strong> of <em>bamboo</em> plant is in all its joints being at equal <em>intervals</em>.	[simplicity; brevity] The ししおどし is a <em>bamboo</em> device for scaring birds from the gates of your garden by clacking against a stone at regular <em>interval</em>s. Its design is <strong>simplicity</strong> itself. (Inspired by PepeSeco).	"Wordplay:<strong> simplicity</strong> -> simcity. You are playing a game of SimCity, a city simulator. You can choose from one of several pre-defined city layouts. One of the city layouts is called ""<strong>SimpliCity</strong> (a simple city for SimCity)"". This layout has nothing but an empty field with <em>bamboo</em> trees planted at regular <em>intervals</em>."	In an existence of utmost<strong> simplicity</strong> you spend time listening to the liquid-filled <em>bamboo</em> tube (ししおどし) clacking at regular <em>interval</em>s.	I imagine one of those little <strong>bamboo</strong> fountains where the bamboo fills with water, tips over and lets out the water, and then tips back to get filled again. In this way, it marks out even <strong>intervals</strong>. THAT is<strong> simplicity</strong>.		
開		open	Gates . . . two hands.		12	1750	1622	42	カイ	ひら.く、ひら.き、-びら.き、ひら.ける、あ.く、あ.ける	Sure you can squeeze through these <em>gates</em> by kicking them or pushing them with your body, but if you want to get them wide<strong> open</strong>, you need to do that with <em>both your hands</em>.	To<strong> open</strong> the <em>gate</em>, use your <em>both hands</em>.	The <em>lesbians</em> use <em>both hands</em> to<strong> open</strong> each other's <em>gates</em>. Sick, but try forgetting this kanji now.	Bill gates is entering the major gate of his mansion and needs his two hand in order to<strong> open</strong> the gate. (you would probably think that Bill Gates has an electric door and that's the case but the conputer that controls it has crashed!).	To<strong> open</strong> those big heavy <em>Gates of Hell</em> it takes <em>both hands</em>…		
閉		closed	Gates . . . genie.		11	1751	1623	42	ヘイ	と.じる、と.ざす、し.める、し.まる、た.てる	"The <em>gates</em> are too big to be <strong>closed</strong> by man. Only a <em>genie</em> can. ""Close sesame!""."	"You hear <em>lesbians</em> moaning ""オォ~"" from behind<strong> closed</strong> <em>gates</em>, and you ask a <em>genius</em> how to get in there."	Bill GATES keeps his operating system<strong> CLOSED</strong>, does that make him a GENIUS? I think not.	"A <em>genie</em> is making sure that the gates of Ali Baba's Cave are always <em>closed</em>. Picture the genie (who lives in an oil lamp in that cave) grumbling about how Ali Baba is so forgetful, and that it's always him, the genie who has to check that the gates are<strong> closed</strong>. See previous frame 1622 ""open"". – Note : I don't worry about the keyword ""cave"" here because you can't have the ""cave"" enclosure within the same kanji as the ""gates"" enclosure."	"""オー no! I stayed out past curfew, and now the gate has been<strong> closed</strong>!""."		
閣		tower	Gates . . . each.		14	1752	1624	42	カク		"To keep this distinct from other kanji such as ""watchtower"" and ""pagoda"", I use the mnemonic ""<em>towering<strong> tower</strong></em>"". – In some old 8-bit kung-fu videogame, with a plot similar as Bruce Lee's last, unfinished movie, the hero must break through a <em>gate</em> at <em>each</em> level of the<strong> tower</strong>ing<strong> tower</strong>, fighting with opponents using various styles of kung-fu until he meets the finale at the topmost level of the ""towering<strong> tower</strong>""."	Remember the two<strong> tower</strong>s from lord of the rings… <em>each</em> has it's own - very difficult to master - entrance <em>gate</em>.	"<em>Each lesbian</em> waits for her turn with ""the<strong> tower</strong>""."	There is a<strong> tower</strong> on each side of the gate, they are posts for archers.	Since<strong> tower</strong> confuses me too much with other Kanji, I will use (political) CABINET instead, where this Kanji is frequently used. The CABINET decides that EACH GATE of a saloon has to have a sign saying that you have to be an adult to be allowed to drink there.		
閑		leisure	Gates . . . tree.		12	1753	1625	42	カン		Imagine the <em>gates</em> the Garden of Eden, the ultimate land of<strong> leisure</strong>. You're not allowed in, but if you peek through you can see <em>trees</em>.	Getting <em>wood</em> watching <em>lesbians</em> is my idea of<strong> leisure</strong> time.	Beyond the <em>Gates of Hell</em>, there is only one<strong> leisure</strong> spot for all the billions of souls within, a single <em>tree</em> beneath which people can sit for a few seconds. Ah, but that moment of<strong> leisure</strong> makes the rest of Hell that much worse…	Imagine <strong>Leisure</strong> Suit Larry walking through the <em>saloon doors</em> with <em>wood</em> in his pants, hoping to get lucky.	"""You can rest in<strong> leisure</strong>, Master Peregrin Took, until battle begins, because the guards of Gondor defend the <em>Gates</em> of the City and the White <em>tree</em>.""."		
聞		hear	<i>Gates</i> . . . <i>ear</i>. Compare the story you invented for the kanji meaning <i>listen</i> (Frame 890).		14	1754	1626	42	ブン、モン	き.く、き.こえる	Press your ear to the gates and see if you can<strong> hear</strong> what is going on inside.	To distinguish from listen, you<strong> hear</strong> someone at the door (gate).	At the GATES of Hell, along with the mouth that asks the impossible questions there is of course a giant EAR to<strong> HEAR</strong> the answers. The ear doesn't really listen as it knows they will always be wrong.	"The genius tells me to put my <em>ear</em> up to the <em>gates</em> in order to<strong> hear</strong> the <em>lesbians</em> better (see <a href=""../v4/1623.html"">closed</a> (#1623 閉)."	"Your ears are the gates that allow you to<strong> hear</strong>. NOTE: You <a href=""../v4/1626.html"">hear</a> (#1626 聞) with your <em>ear</em> alone, but to <a href=""../v4/827.html"">listen</a> (#827 聴) you need to engage your <em>heart</em> as well."		
潤		wet	Water . . . gates . . . king.		15	1755	1627	42	ジュン	うるお.う、うるお.す、うる.む	Forgetting about the moat, the king stepped out of his gate and landed in the water. Needless to say he got<strong> wet</strong>.	(I had the same idea as Dingomick) I imagine some prankster who put a bucket full of <em>water</em> on top of the huge <em>gates</em>, so that it would fall on the <em>king</em> as he came through them. See the king now, between the gates, all<strong> wet</strong>, dripping <em>drops of water</em>.	If I was <em>king</em>, I would be<strong> wet</strong> with the <em>water</em> of <em>lesbians</em> rubbing all over me.	Some prankster threw <em>water</em> on the <em>king</em> as he came to the city gates. Now he's all <strong>wet</strong>.	"I immediately thought of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Imagine <em>King</em> Arthur standing in front of the <em>gate</em> shortly before the end of the movie. When he demands to be let in by the French, they throw dung on him and Belvedere and they get<strong> wet</strong>. (Think of the dung as <em>water</em> in this case, it's liquid anyway) <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs</a> The scene I thought of is at the end of the vid."		
欄		column	Tree . . . gates . . . east.		20	1756	1628	42	ラン	てすり	A <strong>column</strong> of text scratched on a black tree beside the <em>gates of Hell</em>: To the <em>East</em> lies The Beast.	[column; handrail; blank; space] I think about <em>oriental</em> (<em>eastern</em>) Torii <em>gates</em>: they have two supporting <strong>column</strong>s made of <em>wood</em>.	"Ancient morning newspaper<strong> column</strong>, posted daily on a <strong>tree</strong> at the <strong>east gate</strong>. Why the <strong>east gate</strong>? Well, it's a morning paper, and the sun rises in the east, so the morning rays shining through the gate illuminate it nicely. I picture all the ojisan who rise in the wee hours gathering around the tree each, waiting for the sun rise so they can read the paper. ""Been coming here every day for 40 years! Can't start the day without my paper!""."	<em>Bill Gates</em> already dominates the software industry in the West, and now he is turning his attention to the <em>East</em>. Trying to gain popularity and a glentler image there he writes a <em>column</em> in newspapers there about how he plans to save the <em>trees</em> using the latest and greatest features of Windows Vista.	This is a <strong>column of text</strong>, as used in a newspaper. The trick for this kanji is that to mark the <strong>columns</strong> in the old printers, you place <em>wooden</em> blocks at certain intervals of the paper. Now, look at the right part; it looks as if you had put a <em>wooden</em> block in an <em>interval</em> primitive. That graphical reminder will help you to remember this kanji!!		
闘		fight	<i>Gates</i> . . . <i>table</i> . . . <i>glue</i>. Do not confuse with <i>contend</i> (Frame 1238).		18	1757	1629	42	トウ	たたか.う、あらそ.う	During the saloon brawl, one guy got <em>glued to a table</em> and was tossed out <em>through the saloon gates</em>. But he really wanted to<strong> fight</strong>, so he ran back through those gates (with the table still glued to his back) only to be tossed out again. Imagine him repeatedly running in and being tossed back out.	Food<strong> fight</strong>! Look, beans are stuck to the gates like glue.	<em>Bill Gates</em> and <em>Mr. Bean</em> having a <em>glue</em><strong> fight</strong>.	He's<strong> fight</strong>ing to get through the <em>gates</em>, but <em>Mr. Bean</em> doesn't know they are just for show & have been <em>glued</em> together.	In any classic bar<strong> fight</strong> scene, someone crawls under a <em>table</em>, someone sits <em>glue</em>d to the piano, and someone gets thrown clear throught the saloon doors (<em>gates</em>). 戦闘 せんとう battle,<strong> fight</strong>, combat; 闘うたたかう to<strong> fight</strong>; to battle; to combat; to struggle against; to wage war; to engage in contest.		
倉		godown	The single <i>gate</i> is used here not in order to represent one <i>gate</i>, but many of them, indeed a <i>meeting of gates</i>. Add <i>mouth</i> (as an entrance here) and you end up with <b>godown</b>. That should help keep this character distinct from <i>warehouse</i> (Frame 633).		10	1758	1630	42	ソウ	くら	(Warning-this one is crude) Imagine a<strong> godown</strong> (dockside warehouse) where you can <em>meet</em> girls who will <em>godown</em> on you with their <em>mouth</em>. To keep the place a bit of a secert, they only have one <em>gate</em>.	"Hint : the ""godown"" is like a warehouse, it's on the docks and mostly in Asia. To make an image distinct from that of ""warehouse"" or ""storehouse"", etc, I picture the goods stored there, piled up on pallets really high, and thus they have to ""godown"" before they can be taken outside. The front of this<strong> godown</strong> is a ""<em>meeting of small gates</em>"", i.e. a row of gates through which goods come in and out. The <em>mouth</em> can be an opening somewhere in the back, or the top, where cranes lift down the goods."	<strong>Note:</strong> this is not <em>gate</em> but actually a variation of <em>door</em> and is written as such, with the vertical stroke last not first.	Imagine a mafia<strong> godown</strong> at the docks where shifty mafia types <em>meet</em> and lots of dodgy deals<strong> godown</strong>. This is a very secret place, so there is only one <em>gate</em>, and to enter you have to say the password with your <em>mouth</em>.	"A <strong>godown</strong> is an old style warehouse where goods were temporarily stacked stacked to the <em>roof</em>(meeting). A series of <em>gates</em> with <em>mouths</em>(doors) were used access them for shipment. (Primitive <em>EAST INDIA TRADING</em>) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image</a>:WarehousesinAmsterdam.JPG."		
創		genesis	Godown . . . saber.		12	1759	1631	42	ソウ、ショウ	つく.る、はじ.める、きず、けず.しける	Back in the day the people were so excited to get hold of the Sega<strong> genesis</strong> they looted the godown with sabers.	I prefer to have girls <em>Godown</em> on my <em>sabre</em> to prevent unwanted<strong> GENESIS</strong> of babies………… 創造 そうぞう (creation).	The<strong> genesis</strong> of my hatred of kanji learning is when you get so mad that you have to look up what a <em>godown</em> is, and you end up cutting the book (or even Heisig himself) up with a <em>saber</em>.	"In the story of<strong> Genesis</strong> Adam and Even were kicked out of the Garden of Eden. They had to ""go down"" out of the garden and the entrace was guarded with sabers to prevent their return."	God actually has everything ever conceived in a big <em>godown</em>: if you want to exist, you have to grab a <em>sabre</em> and fight your way out. Such is<strong> genesis</strong>.		
非		un-	"This key word, a negating prefix, is a doodle of a heavy iron pole with bars extending in both directions, to create the picture of a jail cell. From there to ""<b>un-</b>"" is but a short step."	* As a primitive, we shall draw on the explanation above for the meaning of <i>jail cell</i>.	8	1760	1632	42	ヒ	あら.ず	This looks like a pictogram of 3 fingers from each hand trying to open up a crack in a wall. That's an<strong> un-</strong>believable way to escape from prison OR the<strong> UN-</strong> have a prison in the Hague.	People in the jail cell are<strong> un-</strong>friendly,<strong> un-</strong>comely, and<strong> un-</strong>cooperative.	Ever wanted to have an <strong>un</strong>do button in life? Well, when you're in a <em>jail cell</em>, that's when you most want to press that button.	<strong>Un-</strong>zipped.	This is a pictograph of goatse. Rather<strong> un-</strong>appealing image, huh?		
俳		haiku	This character is used for the <b>haiku</b>, the 17-syllable poem that is one of Japan's best-known literary forms. Its elements: <i>person</i> .. . <i>jail cell</i>.		10	1761	1633	42	ハイ		I pity the fool/ Who put me in this jail cell/ I pity the fool. (Credit taijuando).	I pity the fool/ Who put me in this jail/ I pity the fool.	<em>Person</em> is put in <em>jail</em> for writing a<strong> haiku</strong> with the wrong number of syllables.	While in jail, some people find Islam, but Mr T finds<strong> haiku</strong>.	A person stuck in jail has nothing better to do than to compose<strong> haiku</strong>.		
排		repudiate	Fingers . . . jail cell.		11	1762	1634	42	ハイ		When ordered to go to the <em>jail cell</em>, the defendant gave the judge the <em>finger</em> and said he<strong> repudiate</strong>d all that the legal system stood for if they were going to send an innocent man like him to jail.	He reached his fingers through the bars of his jail cell, trying to touch his beloved. But she<strong> repudiate</strong>d him and left.	Once he had his <em>fingers</em> around the <em>jail cell bars</em> he <strong>repudiated</strong> all ties with his former gang!	排他 【はいた】 (n) exclusion; (P) 排日 【はいにち】 (n) anti-Japanese; (P) 排出 【はいしゅつ】 (n,vs) evacuation; emission (e.g. of CO2, etc.); ejection; (P) 排除 【はいじょ】 (n,vs) exclusion; removal; rejection; (P) STORY: Giving everyone the FINGER in a JAIL CELL is a good way to be EXCLUDED by everyone from the next prison break.	"Sarah Palin finally gets thrown behind bars in a JAIL CELL for being a complete disgrace to the country. Indignant, she points a FINGER at the guards, screaming, ""I refutiate this! I refudiate it!"" Picture the guards and the other prisoners replying, ""Don't you mean,<strong> REPUDIATE</strong>?""."		
悲		sad	Jail cell . . . heart.		12	1763	1635	42	ヒ	かな.しい、かな.しむ	<strong>Sad</strong>dness is like having your <em>heart</em> captured and <em>jailed</em> because of some<strong> sad</strong> or terrible event, etc. Here the<strong> sad</strong> <em>heart</em> waits for someone to come and <em>un</em>-lock their <em>jail cell</em> and set them free again.	Stuck in a <em>jail cell</em> with his <em>heart</em> crying out to see his family again, the prisoner has never felt so<strong> sad</strong>.	A <em>jail cell</em> will make any <em>heart</em><strong> sad</strong>.	"For some reason, this kanji makes me think of some Toni Braxton song, but I change the lyrics to ""Un-<em>jail</em> my <em>heart</em>"". Now that mnemonic has stuck in my head."	Imagine the<strong> sad</strong> image of a prisoner in a <em>jail cell</em> feeling<strong> sad</strong> as he looks at all the little <em>hearts</em> his daughter used to draw for him when she was just a child. Now she wants nothing to do with him.

"An old man serving a very long jail sentence painted a life-like <em>door</em> at the back of his <em>jail cell</em>, hlafway open, with the blue sky, clouds, etc, as some kind of symbol of freedom. Every time the prison officers come to take him they ask him to come to the door. The old man with a grin always answers ""Which <em>door</em>?"", looking at his painted door with a grin. And the prison officer always answer, sighing - ""The<strong> front door</strong> !""."	It's a sad reflection on modern times that our<strong> front door</strong>s need to be built like <em>jail cell</em>s to keep us safe. 扉 (とびら) : door, opening.	A jail cell only has one door. The<strong> front door</strong>.	Your<strong> front door</strong> leads to a jail cell in order to trick burglers.		
侯		marquis	<i>Person</i> . . . <i>key</i> . . . <i>dart</i>. Hint: the pun suggested by the pronunciation of the key word and the primitive for <i>key</i> may come in helpful.		9	1767	1639	42	コウ		<em>Mr. T</em> is made a <strong>marquis</strong> after he and the A-Team save the life of a duke. The duke also gives Mr. T the key to the gentleman's <em>dart</em> room where one can relax in luxury, smoke a cigar, and play a friendly game of <em>darts</em>. <em>Mr. T</em> eagerly accepts the <em>key</em> and places it on one of the gold chains that hang around his neck which acts as a key chain.	(Going off various) Mr. T. is made a<strong> marquis</strong> and given the key to the city. But somebody disagrees with it and assassinates him with a dart.	MR.T had one final challenge before he would be promoted to a<strong> MARQUIS</strong>. He must shoot a DART through the hole of a KEY.	<strong>Marquis</strong> Keydartee (make-believe french name, Key+dart+T).	"The French government hires <em>Mr. T</em> to bring the<strong> Marquis</strong> de Sade to justice. The<strong> Marquis</strong> runs away frantically. T pronounces himself ""The Mar-<em>key</em> de <em>Darts</em>"" and throws a bunch at Sade, felling him on the city streets."

The <em>Marquis de Sade</em> was kinda gay. He used to <em>mouth</em> down a lot of deep-<strong>throat</strong> action.	"I think of ""clearing your<strong> throat</strong>"". Some stuffy guy opens his <em>mouth</em> to clear his<strong> throat</strong> so the <em>marquis</em> can speak."	"""I swear, I'll cut his <strong>throat</strong>! If he opens his <em>mouth</em> one more time, I'll cut the <em>marquis</em>' <strong>throat</strong>"", his rival the baron said."	After MR.T was made a MARQUIS he was given a KEY to the DART room which he put in his MOUTH and swallowed down his<strong> THROAT</strong>.		
候		climate	<i>Marquis</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i>. Note where the <i>walking stick</i> is positioned in this kanji.		10	1769	1640	42	コウ	そうろう	The <em>marquis</em> has absolutely no interest in issuses of<strong> climate</strong> change. He's old and near death. [Don't forget the <em>walking stick</em> to symbolize his old age.].	The <em>marquis</em> moves to a warmer<strong> climate</strong> after he gets old enough to need a <em>walking stick</em> to get around.	In his old age (<em>walking stick</em>) Marquis T becomes Al Gore's<strong> climate</strong> control nemisis.	The Marquis de Sade grows old, grabs a walking stick and moves to Florida for the warmer<strong> climate</strong> and to torture older ladies with his darts.	"As Mr. T drives off the lot in his new Mercury Grand <em>Marquis</em>, the<strong> climate</strong> control screws up, causing him to pull out his <em>walking stick</em> and beat up the dash. ""I pity the fool who sold me this piece of junk""."		
決		decide	The etymology of <b>decide</b> (de-cidere = cut off) will help here; the elements are: <i>water</i> . . . <i>guillotine</i>.		7	1770	1641	42	ケツ	き.める、-ぎ.め、き.まる、さ.く	"""<strong>Decide</strong>!"" ""<strong>Decide</strong>?! Death by drowning in polluted <em>water</em> or death by <em>guillotine</em>. How can I <strong>decide</strong>?"" I asked."	To<strong> decide</strong> if someone is a witch or not first dunk them in <em>water</em>. If they don't drown they are a witch and can be sent to the <em>guillotine</em>.	(Seriously, do we really need the guillotine primitive? Surely <em>key</em> and <em>person</em> are adequate…) I have<strong> decide</strong>d that drinking more water is the <em>key</em> to becoming a more healthy <em>person</em>. 決まる きまる be<strong> decide</strong>d, fixed, certain; 決める きめる<strong> decide</strong>, fix, choose; 決心 けっしん determination, resolution; 決定 けってい decision, determination; 解決 かいけつ settlement, solution, resolution.

A <strong>cheerful</strong> crowd of insulted aliens applaude as <em>Data</em>'s head is chopped off by <em>guillotine</em>.	Data is<strong> cheerful</strong> as he goes to the guillotine. That's because he knows he can just solder his head back on afterwards.	<em>Data</em> was soo<strong> cheerful</strong> when he was put in charge of the <em>guillotine</em>! He can't wait for the next person to commit a crime!	"If Monty Python had set their movie ""Life of Brian"" in the time of the French revolution, you can just picture how the characters in a<strong> cheerful</strong> <em>state of mind</em> would sing: ""Always look on the bright side of life!"" on their way to the <em>guillotine</em>."		
偉		admirable	Person . . . locket.		12	1772	1643	42	イ	えら.い	Mr. T is certainly an<strong> ADMIRABLE</strong> PERSON, so much so that parents are buying lockets with his picture in it and having their children wear them like amulets.	"For <em>locket</em>: The <em>locket</em> (<em>key</em> dangling from something, the vertical stroke) opens like a <em>mouth</em>, but you need a jeweler's <em>monocle</em> to make out the pictures within. —– <em>Dracula</em> survives a staking attempt when the <em>locket</em> with Mina's<strong> admirable</strong> picture deflects the blow. ""It was an<strong> admirable</strong> attempt,"" he admits as he sucks his attacker's blood."	<strong>Stroke order:</strong> Heisig says that the added vertical stroke is the third stroke, but it's the first of primitive (so it's the third of <em>this</em> kanji, but in the book he's talking about the primitive).	She thought that <em>Mr. T</em> was a tough, heartless guy, but then she found out that he carries around a <em>locket</em> with a picture of his daughter. Suddenly, she found it<strong> admirable</strong> that he had such a soft side.

You ask people if they've seen it, but no luck. ""Just buy another one,"" someone says. ""I mean, what's the<strong> difference</strong>?"" Then of course you say ""Well, it makes a huge<strong> difference</strong>!! Since it has sentimental value, I don't want a different one! "" Then of course they understand."	You loose your LOCKET on the ROAD and report it to the 交番 . They find one, and show it to you. 「これですか？」 But it's the wrong one… You say, 「いいえ。。<strong>違います</strong>。。」.	"An odd version of The Road Less Traveled: ""I found a <em>locket</em> in the <em>road</em>, and that has made all the<strong> difference</strong>.""."	You know what the<strong> difference</strong> is between you and me? I find this expensive locket on the road and I look for the owner. You, on the other hand, look for a pawn shop. THAT's the<strong> difference</strong>.	Noticing a<strong> difference</strong> between the <em>locket</em> hanging around his lover's neck and the <em>locket</em> he had giver her he rips it off her and throws it in the <em>road</em>.

Spiderman on a boat, marking the Earth's <strong>latitudes</strong>. He first attaches a personal locket to a small piece of thread for ballast and good luck, and shoots with his right hand. After a few minutes (and lots and lots of thread), the <em>locket and thread</em> have flown around the world. Spiderman catches the locket with his left hand, and ties the thread's ends together. Voilà.	"Hint : this kanji also means ""latitude"", which are the<strong> horizontal</strong> lines on a globe. Do you remember James Heisig's story for frame 175 ""black ink"" ? Here a cartographer on a ship, is using his ""<em>thread locket</em>"" to mark<strong> horizontal</strong> lines on a map. He pulls a chalked thread from the locket, and snaps it to mark<strong> horizontal</strong> lines. Imagine the ""thread-locket"" in the shape of a globe, filled with dark powder and a little bobbin of thread."	Spiderman gave up being spiderman and promised Mary Jane to live the<strong> horizontal</strong> life like the rest of us. Whenever he starts to feel like he wants to go back to his spidy ways, he takes out his locket with a mary jane picture to remind him that he will forever live<strong> horizontal</strong>y.

Since it was in the middle of the <em>boulevard</em>, everyone could see she hit the man only in self-<strong>defense</strong>, as he was trying to steal her valuable <em>locket</em>.	I think of<strong> defense</strong> as an attribute in video games. Like Final Fantasy, for example.

韓		Korea	As with <i>Italy</i> (Frame 1245) and <i>Africa</i> (Frame 1391), this character simply abbreviates the full name of <i>Korea</i>.

I bomb<strong> Korea</strong> every night, then I send them 10 sunflowers and a locket to apologize the next morning.		
干		dry	It is best to see this kanji as a pictograph of a revolving circular clothesline (viewed from the side). Spin it around quickly in your mind's eye to give it the connotation of to <b>dry</b>.	* The primitive meaning is <i>clothesline</i>.	3	1777	1648	43	カン	ほ.す、ほ.し-、-ぼ.し、ひ.る	<strong>Dry</strong> <em>one</em> item in <em>ten</em> minutes on the <em>clothesline</em>.	Note: the book shows the strokes for <em>potato</em> rather than<strong> dry</strong>…dry does not have the hook at the end.	<em>Vampire</em>: Upside down samurai. They suck humans<strong> dry</strong>.	"A<strong> dry</strong> <em>water lily</em> with no <em>drops</em> on it (see <a href=""../v4/1484.html"">even</a> (#1484 平)."	Heisig's pictograph of a <em>clothesline</em> is fine, but I also see another pictograph here, that of <em>one</em> <em>needle</em> trying to push its way through the<strong> dry</strong> <em>surface of the earth</em> above it but because of a lack of rain the earth is parched and<strong> dry</strong> thus this <em>one</em> <em>needle</em> stays buried in the earth below. Furthermore, you could say that the earth is so<strong> dry</strong> that there's not even <em>one needle</em> left on it.		
肝		liver	Part of the body . . . dry.		7	1778	1649	43	カン	きも	Well you all know that the<strong> liver</strong> is the <em>part of the body</em> that would be quite grateful if you led a <em>dry</em> lifestyle (i.e. no alcohol).	The slaughterhouse prefers to ship dried<strong> liver</strong> to the supermarkets (can you imagine boxes soaked in blood on the truck that delivers them?). Imagine them lifting the slabs of flesh and hanging them on the clothesline to dry.	"Imagine Hannibal Lecter recounting his <em>flesh</em>-eating days: ""I ate his<strong> liver</strong> with some fava beans and a nice <em>dry</em> chianti""."	Imagine a beat up<strong> liver</strong>(too much alcohol). The doctor takes your<strong> liver</strong> out of your body, and puts it on a clothes line to dry off. Then puts it back in your body, sealing up the flesh. A dry<strong> liver</strong> is a healthy<strong> liver</strong> he chuckles as he puts it back.	The part of the flesh that keeps the blood dry of toxins is the<strong> LIVER</strong>.		
刊		publish	Dry . . . saber.		5	1779	1650	43	カン		The newspaper pages are hung on the <em>clotheseline</em> to dry and then cut down with a <em>sabre</em> to be <strong>publish</strong>ed.	The newspaper pages are hung on the <em>clotheseline</em> to dry. This gives the government a chance to censor the news: they cut up unwanted stories with a <em>sabre</em>. Therefore, only state-approved stories are <strong>published</strong>.	The author's work was so <em>dry</em> that he had to threaten the<strong> publish</strong>er with a <em>sabre</em> in order to get them to<strong> publish</strong> it.	<em>Cut</em> and <em>dried</em> - yeah, that sounds like most of the drivel<strong> publish</strong>ed nowadays.	I can't<strong> publish</strong> this. It's too <em>dry</em>. Don't you have any stories with people getting attacked with <em>sabre</em>s or something?		
汗		sweat	Water . . . dry.		6	1780	1651	43	カン	あせ	The way<strong> sweat</strong> is supposed to work: it gets your skin <em>wet</em>, and then as it evaporates/<em>dries</em>, it cools you off.	When you<strong> sweat</strong> your clothes become soaked with <em>water</em>, prompting you to hang them to <em>dry</em> on a clothesline.	<strong>Sweat</strong> a process to regulate body temperature : <em>water</em> comes out of the pores of the skin, and when it <em>dries</em> it cools you off.	When you want to<strong> sweat</strong>, there are 2 kinds of sauna - wet (<em>watery</em>) and <em>dry</em>.	Vampire trivia: <em>vampire</em>s have no<strong> sweat</strong> glands to secrete <em>water</em>. Have you ever seen a vampire wet with<strong> sweat</strong>? That is why they can't be in the sun. The<strong> sweat</strong> water can't come out so they will just explode.		
軒		flats	This kanji, a counter for houses, is made up of <i>cars</i> . . . <i>dry</i>.		10	1781	1652	43	ケン	のき	<strong>Flats</strong> in the city are crowded. You get a space for your <em>car</em> in front, and a <em>clothesline</em> out back. Nothing else.	Small <strong>flats</strong> (garages) for <em>cars</em> help keeping them <em>dry</em>.	Did you hear about the guy obsessed with his <em>car</em>? He keeps it in his <strong>flat</strong> to keep <em>dry</em>.	A flat/house definition: 'The thing that is between the car (in front) and the clothesline (in back) .	I don't have a garage, so I keep my <em>car</em> in my <strong>flat</strong> to keep it <em>dry</em>.		
岸		beach	Mountain . . . cliff . . . dry.		8	1782	1653	43	ガン	きし	At the base of <em>mountain</em> <em>cliff</em>s, there is usually a<strong> beach</strong>. You often can see people lying there, <em>drying</em> off after a swim.	Three impossibilities for a <strong>beach</strong>: There cannot be a <strong>beach</strong> at the top of a <em>mountain</em>. There cannot be a<strong> beach</strong> on the top of a <em>cliff</em>. There cannot be a<strong> beach</strong> that is completely <em>dry</em>.	"I use a play on words here to help with the similar keywords such as ""strand"", and ""coast"". The<strong> Beach</strong> Boys just had a concert down at the<strong> beach</strong>, and they're all wet after the performance. It's not <em>dry</em> enough down at the<strong> beach</strong> so they climb the nearest <em>cliff</em>. Still, it's not <em>dry</em> enough there so they climb the nearest <em>mountain</em>. Finally, the air seems <em>dry</em> and they take a rest while their clothes <em>dry</em>."	The fastest way to reach the<strong> beach</strong> starting from our mountain cabin is to go down the MOUNTAIN until the CLIFF and slide down the CLOTHESLINE directly onto the<strong> beach</strong>!	A nude<strong> beach</strong> is generally sheltered from sight under a <em>mountains</em> or a <em>cliff</em>, where the bathers can <em>dry</em> in privacy.		
幹		tree trunk	<i>Mist</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>dry</i>. The meaning of this key word extends beyond <b>tree trunks</b> to represent the main stem or line of anything from railway lines to managerial staffs. This should help distinguish it from the stories used earlier for <i>book</i> (Frame 224) and <i>body</i> (Frame 1030), both of which made use of the image of a <b>tree trunk</b>, as well as the kanji for <i>trunk</i> (Frame 194).		13	1783	1654	43	カン	みき	A fine <em>mist</em> is falling, and so everyone gathers around near the<strong> tree-trunk</strong>, effectively using the rest of the tree as an <em>umbrella</em> in order to keep <em>dry</em>.	By astridtops - In the rainy <em>mist</em>, Totoro is standing in front of a<strong> tree-trunk</strong> at the bus stop, under the <em>umbrella</em> he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains <em>dry</em>! Great story…which I get to by thinking:<strong> tree-trunk</strong>-><strong>TT</strong> -><strong>T</strong>onari no <strong>T</strong>otoro. I also imagine Mickey Mouse is there too as the KUNyomi for this kanji is みき.	The word that you will sure see with this kanji is shinkansen (bullet train). 新幹線 . STORY: Shinkansen is very expensive, so I only use it when a MIST is falling. I prefer the train than an UMBRELLA to stay DRY.	There is no tree in this kanji! So think of a cold, bare, dead<strong> tree-trunk</strong>, with the upper branches all cut off. Residents of the neighboring house have run a <em>clothesline</em> from their window to the dead<strong> tree-trunk</strong>. You are filled with sadness, seeing the greatness of nature being destroyed and exploited by mankind. You are walking by this sad scene on a cold and drizzly day with a fine <em>mist</em> descending, using an <em>umbrella</em> to keep yourself <em>dry</em>.	In the rainy <em>mist</em>, Totoro is standing in front of a<strong> tree-trunk</strong> at the bus stop, under the <em>umbrella</em> he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains <em>dry</em>!		
芋		potato	Flowers . . . potato.		6	1784	1655	43	ウ	いも	If your <strong>potato</strong>s are growing <em>flowers</em> and those little <em>hooked roots</em>, you should either buy less or eat them faster.	If your<strong> potato</strong>es are growing <em>flowers</em>, you need to store them in a more <em>dry</em> place, like hanging them on <em>hooks</em> so they don't accumulate moisture on the floor.	"Believe it or not, originally the <strong>potato</strong> was cultivated because of its beautiful <em>flowers</em> rather than for eating the actual ""<em>potato</em>"" below. (historical fact)."	"Tip : the bottom primitive (<em>potato with hooks</em>) can be thought of as ""Mr<strong> Potato</strong> Head"", the toy patented in 1952 with which you can make faces. This <em>potato</em> has little <em>hooks</em> onto which you can attach ears, noses, glasses, etc. to make all sorts of faces."	"The<strong> potato</strong> plant consists of both flowers and the root below. The root (the part of a plant that hooks into the soil), is all that most people think of when they hear the word ""potato."" Therefore, while the kanji for <strong>potato</strong> contains all parts of the plant - flowers and roots - as a primitive, only focus on the important part - the roots."		
宇		eaves	House . . . potato.		6	1785	1656	43	ウ		Under the<strong> eaves</strong> of the house the poor family has potate plants.	Very good image Erik. To help those who struggleded with this, the<strong> eaves</strong> of a house is usually the bit where you hang the roof gutter along, usually made of zinc or plastic and shaped as a half-pipe. It catches rain water, so it flows to a drain pipe instead of down onto people and windows. And in this family the potato plants grow along the<strong> eaves</strong> so the water pours down on them. They are poor. so no gutter.	This kanji means <strong>universe</strong>, seen here as a <em>roof</em> as that was how it was represented back then the <em>vault of heaven</em>. Today, we know that seen from the <strong>universe</strong>, our planet has the aspect of a <em>potato</em>, and not a perfect sphere.	During christmas, since your family is TOO POOR, you hang potatoes off the<strong> eaves</strong> instead of christmas lights.	"Sam at the beginning of the Lord of the Rings was outside the house in the potato bushes when Gandalf was talking with Frodo, even though he denied it: ""I wasn't dropping no<strong> eaves</strong>, sir. Honest!""."		
余		too much	<i>Umbrella</i> . . . <i>potato</i> . . . <i>little</i>. The last stroke of <i>potato</i> and the first of <i>little</i> coincide in this character.	"* Since the phrase ""<i>too much</i>"" is overly abstract, we shall take the image of a <i>scale</i> whose indicator spins round and round on the dial because <i>too much</i> weight has been set on it. It will help to use this image in learning the kanji itself."	7	1786	1657	43	ヨ	あま.る、あま.り、あま.す、あんま.り	You hang an <em>umbrella</em> upside-down on a hook of the <strong>scales</strong> and fill it with <em>little</em> <em>potatoes</em>. No luck: it weights <strong>too much</strong>.	"This is the kanji for 「あまり Amari」, which means <strong>too little</strong> in negative sentences and <strong>too much</strong> in the rest (always with a negative sense). I take the liberty of using the symbol "">"" (<strong>more than</strong>, another meaning!!) as the <em>umbrella</em> component, and using <a href=""../v4/2.html"">two</a> (#2 二) and <a href=""../v4/105.html"">little</a> (#105 小) for the <em>potato</em> primitive. So, this kanji either means ""<em>two</em> much"" (more than 2) or ""<em>two little</em>"". (thanks, Virtua_leaf and Thunderball!)."	I was worried that my <em>POTATOES</em> were getting<strong> TOO MUCH</strong> direct sunlight so I stood over them with an <em>UMBRELLA</em>. Now they are getting too <em>LITTLE</em> rain! I clearly have<strong> TOO MUCH</strong> free time on my hands.	<em>Umbrellas</em> for <em>little potatoes</em>??? That's<strong> too much</strong>!	You're weighing potatoes to take from the market but they weigh<strong> too much</strong>. It's windy, so you hook your umbrella onto the scale hoping to subtract weight by catching the wind's force. Still<strong> too much</strong> weight. Just give up and select some smaller potatoes, man. Won't be<strong> too much</strong> weight then.		
除		exclude	Pinnacle . . . scale.		10	1787	1658	43	ジョ、ジ	のぞ.く、-よ.け	To become a member of <em>The Pinnacle</em>, they test you on a <em>scale</em>. If you weigh <em>too much</em>, they <strong>exclude</strong> you.	You won't make it unless you <strong>exclude</strong> something. The climb to the <em>pinacle</em> cannot be completed if you are carrying <em>too much</em>. You just have to decide what you can afford to <strong>exclude</strong>.	Before entering <em>The Pinnacle</em>, one must be weighed on a <em>scale</em>. The authorities have to<strong> exclude</strong> anyone who is over 300 pds since their weight might damage the floor.	Officials at the Acropolis<strong> exclude</strong> access to vehicles that weigh too much. Some gate staff also apply this to people (generally Americans) who weigh over 250 lbs.	(insert fat celeb here) is<strong> exclude</strong>d at <em>The Pinnacle</em> because he/she weighs <em>too much</em>.		
徐		gradually	Line . . . scale.		10	1788	1659	43	ジョ	おもむ.ろに	You can't expect weight loss to happen overnight. You should limit <em>going</em> to the <em>scale</em> to weigh yourself to once a day or once a week, in order to observe the anticipated weight loss<strong> gradually</strong>.	I set up a <em>column</em> chart next to my <em>scales</em> so I could record my weight<strong> gradually</strong> changing.	Remember the urban legend of the ARMY COLUMN that weighed TOO MUCH with their rythmic marching that the bridge collapsed? Now ARMY COLUMNS will march<strong> GRADUALLY</strong> across so that they do not bear TOO MUCH on the bridge.	<em>Flash</em> didn't get fat overnight. He <strong>gradually</strong> added a pound on the <em>scale</em> here and there until finally he weighed <em>too much</em> to fit into his snazzy red costume. (Credit: CharleyGarrett).	Ever since he's stopped doing Tours, <em>Lance</em> has been<strong> gradually</strong> gaining weight. See him cringe as he steps on a <em>scale</em> and sees it<strong> gradually</strong> go up!		
叙		confer	<i>Scale</i> . . <i>crotch</i>. The key word has to do with <b>conferring</b> ranks, titles, and awards. It should not be confused with <i>bestow</i> (Frame 1335) or <i>impart</i> (Frame 795).		9	1789	1660	43	ジョ	つい.ず、ついで	Amazed at the <em>weight</em> of his <em>crotch</em>, they <strong>confer</strong>red every honor upon him. (Image: guy with his junk on a scale getting a medal pinned to his chest/around his neck/being knighted, etc.).	"(This kanji stands for <strong>description</strong> in my kanji dictionary) ""At first, I thought it was <em>too little</em>, but soon became <em>too much</em>"", is the <strong>description</strong> that my girlfriend gave of my <em>crotch</em>."	When you<strong> confer</strong> <em>again</em> 又 , you<strong> confer</strong> <em>too much</em> 余 !	When the fighter was weighed, the <em>scales spun wildly</em>. On closer inspection, it seems he is well-endowed and his <em>crotch</em> was pressing against the scales, adding vastly more amounts of weight. The judges then had to<strong> confer</strong> amongst themselves to consider what should be his real weight division.	Having honours<strong> confer</strong>red on him proved to be <em>too much</em>! He overbalanced, so instead of kneeling at the queen's feet, he somehow ended up sitting <em>cross-legged</em>.		
途		route	Scale . . . road.		10	1790	1661	43	ト	みち	On this<strong> route</strong>, all trucks have to check in at the scales before they can get on the road.	There are <em>too many roads</em>, so you need to plan a<strong> route</strong>.	When you’re spending <em>too much</em> time on the <em>road</em>, you’re always en <em>route</em> to somewhere.	Truck drivers in the US have to drive the truck onto some massive scales at state borders, for tax reasons. They have to plan their<strong> route</strong> accordingly; there aren't scales on every road.	Too much traffic on this road, lets take a different<strong> route</strong>!		
斜		diagonal	Scale . . . measuring cup.		11	1791	1662	43	シャ	なな.め、はす	The main bar of an old-fashioned <em>scale(balance)</em> will be very <strong>diagonal</strong> if you place a giant <em>measuring cup</em> on one side.	The <em>scale</em> tilts<strong> diagonal</strong>ly when a <em>measuring cup</em> filled with <em>too much</em> is set on one end.	"The constellation of libra (meaning "" scales"" in latin) is<strong> diagonal</strong> to the handle of the big dipper."	An old scale with <em>measuring cups</em> on both sides: If you put <em>too much</em> in only one of the <em>measuring cups</em>, the bar will change its position to<strong> diagonal</strong> (one <em>measuring cup</em> outweights the other).	If you visit<strong> DiagonAl</strong>ley, you'll find a lot of shops measuring out potion ingredients with <em>scales</em> and <em>measuring cups</em>.		
塗		paint	Water . . . scale . . . ground.		13	1792	1663	43	ト	ぬ.る、ぬ.り、まみ.れる	If you add <em>too much water</em> to the<strong> paint</strong> it will drip onto the <em>ground</em>.	A true artisan mixes his own <strong>paint</strong> from <em>water</em> and <em>soils</em> on a <em>scale</em> in careful proportions.	People ask why the ground of our backyard is entirely white. Well, my cheapskate dad wanted to add a fresh coat of white<strong> paint</strong> to our house. He bought the biggest, cheapest tub, placed it on a scale in our yard, and started diluting it with water. It was working fine, and he was adding water drop by drop and carefully checking the weight each time. However, his hand slipped, and he added <em>too much water</em> and the <em>scale broke down violently</em>, spilling the<strong> paint</strong> <em>all over the ground</em>.	The<strong> paint</strong> was WATERed down and TOO MUCH dripped on the GROUND.	If you put too much water in the<strong> PAINT</strong> mix in some soil to make it thicker.		
束		bundle	In the same way that we were able to see the <i>sun</i> in the <i>tree</i> within the kanji for <i>east</i>, here we see a square container in the shape of a <i>mouth</i>.		7	1793	1664	43	ソク	たば、たば.ねる、つか、つか.ねる	Mnemonic:<strong> Bundle</strong> of joy. Here I see the proverbial stork with a baby hanging from its <em>mouth</em> fly straight into a <em>tree</em>. Painful, but he doesn't drop the<strong> bundle</strong>.	Unlike in 杏 , this big mouth isn't content to wait for apricots to fall in his mouth, so he has climbed the tree and is taking them in<strong> bundle</strong>s.	A<strong> bundle</strong> of some kind has been stuffed into the <em>opening</em> of a <em>tree</em>.	This is an image of the monster Gojira (AKA Godzilla) that is so mad it has eaten all the trees. So a<strong> bundle</strong> of trees sticks out of Gojiras mouth as it rampages through Tokyo.	"Tip: I was looking for a personification for<strong> bundle</strong> man [+fab] and came across this evocative story from the archives (1889) <a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9901E5D9163BE033A25755C2A9659C94689FD7CF"">http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9901E5D9163BE033A25755C2A9659C94689FD7CF</a> Caution: the famous vagrant is known as Leather Man so don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/1893.html"">leather</a> (#1893 革). But in the end I couldn't resist both because of the interesting story and the fact one of the possessions found in his mysterious sack (bundle) was an awl as used in subsequent frames 1671-1674!"		
頼		trust	Bundle . . . head.		16	1794	1665	43	ライ	たの.む、たの.もしい、たよ.る	We found a bundle of severed heads in your room, its difficult to<strong> trust</strong> you.	Don't<strong> Trust</strong> the press just a <em>bundle</em> of lies on every <em>page</em>!	[trust; request] Do you <strong>trust</strong> anything? Actually we do, as long as a <em>bundle</em> of <em>heads</em> say the same thing. If a <em>bundle</em> of scientist's <em>heads</em> say we live in a 12 dimensions universe, why should we not <strong>trust</strong> them?	"Even though the stork didn't drop its <em>bundle</em> when it crashed into the tree, I still don't<strong> trust</strong> it to deliver any more babies - the one I got isn't right in the <em>head</em>. Must be a result of the stork-tree collision (see also <a href=""../v4/1669.html"">quick</a> (#1669 速))."

瀬		rapids	Water . . . bundle . . . head.		19	1795	1666	43	ライ	せ	You need complete <em>trust</em> in your <em>water</em> guide to attempt Class 5 <strong>rapids</strong>.	You can never trust the water in the<strong> rapids</strong>, it will do everything it can to pull you under. Imagine a line of natives with bundles upon their heads all fighting the<strong> rapids</strong> to cross the river.	The water in the<strong> rapids</strong> can't be trusted.	When I saw a <em>bundle</em> of severed <em>heads</em> floating in the water, I didn't <em>trust</em> the<strong> rapids</strong>, or the guide for that matter…	The <em>water</em> of the<strong> rapids</strong> are not to be <em>trusted</em>.		
勅		imperial order	In order to keep this character distinct from that for an <i>imperial edict</i> (Frame 366), we must draw again on a pun. Think of the <b>order</b> here as a mail <b>order</b> or an <b>order</b> of pizza phoned in by the Emperor for delivery to the <b>imperial</b> palace. Then it will not be hard to put together <i>bundle</i> and <i>muscle</i> to form a story about an <b>imperial order</b>.		9	1796	1667	43	チョク	いまし.める、みことのり	This is an<strong> imperial order</strong> for pizza. To deliver the huge bundle of pizzas to the emperor, the pizza boy needs huge muscles.	<strong>Imperial order</strong> carries quite a <em>bundle</em> of executive <em>power</em>.	"""Did someone have an<strong> imperial order</strong> for pizza?"" says the muscular delivery boy with a large ""bundle"" in the new adult film, ""The Emperor's Nude Groove""."	The emperor makes an<strong> imperial order</strong>: A <em>bundle</em> of seafood pizzas, mainly with <em>muscles</em> for topping.	A (written)<strong> imperial order</strong>: a little <em>bundle</em> of paper that carries a lot of <em>power</em>.		
疎		alienate	<i>Zoo</i> . . . <i>bundle</i>. Note that the element for <i>zoo</i> is flattened out on the left just as <i>leg</i> (Frame 1372) had been. This is the only time we will meet this form in this book.		12	1797	1668	43	ソ、ショ	うと.い、うと.む、まば.ら	[True story] In Osaka the homeless (the<strong> alienate</strong>d) live in large numbers around the city <em>zoo</em>. Picture them in winter all <em>bundled</em> up in rags trying to keep warm,<strong> alienate</strong>d from the society, living literally worst than the animals in the <em>zoo</em> who at least are <em>bundled</em> in their natural furs and have pens to live in sheltered from the elements.	This kanji is so strange that it was<strong> alienate</strong>d at the kanji <em>zoo</em>. The <em>bundle</em> of joy stork bundles this kanji up and takes it to a kanji foster home.	Think of a Kanji <em>Zoo</em>, where we <em>bundle</em> up all the bizarre and hard to remember kanji, to be ridiculed and <em>alienated</em> from the other more sensible kanji. This kanji definately belongs there!	The cleaner at the ZOO felt<strong> ALIENATE</strong>D by everyone. Granted, he was carrying around the BUNDLE of manure he cleaned from the ZOO cages. (Just picture a zoo cleaner carrying a bundle of dung with the crowd avoiding him).	"Very rarely does this kanji appear in a word meaning ""alienate."" The better meaning is ""sparse,"" such as not dense, very few, scattered, or spread irregularly. It also appears in words that have to do with ""neglect."" 疎ら 【まばら】 (adj-na,n) sparse; (P) STORY: at the ZOO BUNDLES of happy animals are SPARSE."		
辣		bitter	Spicy . . . bundle.		14	1798	3025	43	ラツ	から.い	<strong>bitter</strong>, <em>spicy</em>, <em>bundle</em>: In a desperate attempt of creating a new drink, they decided to mix a <strong>bitter</strong> drink with a <em>spicy</em> one – now <em>bundled</em> together for the same price of one! However,<strong> bitter</strong>ness didn't go well with the spicy, as seen in the misshape to the left.	The<strong> bitter</strong> taste was so awful that I put whole <em>bundle</em> of <em>spice</em> in my mouth to get rid of it.	I'm rather <strong>bitter</strong> that someone stole my <em>spice bundle</em>.	<strong>severe</strong>: When you were forced to put the spicy bundle of Wasabi in your mouth, you experienced severe pain.	Too many spicy things bundled in a meal will make anyone feel<strong> bitter</strong> towards the cook. 辛辣 ; 辛らつ 【しんらつ】 (adj-na,n)<strong> bitter</strong>; sharp; acrimonious 悪辣 ; 悪らつ 【あくらつ】 (adj-na) crafty; vicious; unscrupulous; sharp.		
速		quick	Bundle . . . road.		10	1799	1669	43	ソク	はや.い、はや-、はや.める、すみ.やか	If you find a bundle of money on the road, pick it up<strong> quick</strong> before anyone notices.	Uh oh. The stork just dropped the <em>bundle</em> of joy in the middle of the <em>road</em>. Somebody save it,<strong> quick</strong>!	Jack be nimble, Jack be <strong>quick</strong>, Jack jump over the <em>bundle</em> in the middle of the road.	A <em>bundle</em> of optic fibers running along the <em>road</em> makes for<strong> quick</strong> internet access.	I banged her<strong> quick</strong>, then bundled up and hit the road!		
整		organize	Bundle . . . taskmaster . . . correct.		16	1800	1670	43	セイ	ととの.える、ととの.う	Recycling in Japan, you have to make sure all your <em>bundles</em> are<strong> organize</strong>d <em>correctly</em> otherwise the <em>taskmasters</em> won't accept them.	When a <em>bundle</em> of <em>taskmasters</em> <strong>organize</strong> something chances are it won't be done <em>correctly</em> because they are constantly arguing.	<strong>Organize</strong>, def: when <em>taskmasters bundle</em> tasks <em>correctly</em>.	At stork headquarters there is a<em> taskmaster</em> who<strong> organize</strong>s all the outgoing <em>bundles of joy</em>. It is very important to<strong> organize</strong> things so that the <em>correct</em> bundle goes to the <em>correct</em> place!!! (Just imagine if the crocodiles opened their bundle to find kittens!!!).	When you have a <em>bundle</em> of things to<strong> organize</strong> appoint a <em>taskmaster</em> to oversee it is done <em>correct</em>ly.		
剣		saber	<i>Awl</i> . . . <i>saber</i>. As we promised way back in frame 87, here at last is the kanji on which the primitive element of the same name is based.		10	1801	1671	43	ケン	つるぎ	If it helps, make the awl primitive <strong>ice pick</strong> instead. They're basically the same thing. This kanji is an easy David vs. Goliath story of the <strong>icepick</strong> vs. the <em>saber</em>…	"Every self-respecting ninja knows the story of ""The <em>Awl and the Sabre</em>"". According to the legend, a woman once defended herself by using an <em>awl</em> against a <em>sabre</em>! She used to work all day with that <em>awl</em>. However, the bandit using the <em>sabre</em> had no skill. And thus the <em>awl</em> beat the <em>sabre</em>. And from there the saying goes : ""The <em>sabre</em> is powerless against the <em>awl</em>, if one can't use the <em>sabre</em>.""."	ICE PICK primitive: How do you FIT a PERSON into a tight BOX (mouth primitive)? Poke holes in him with a ICE PICK, draining the blood and making the body smaller. STORY: If that does not work, take out your<strong> SABER</strong> and cut them up into neat pieces.	As a non-native speaker of English, I really couldn't work with the awl primitive, since I can't even imagine what kind of tool it would be. So, I had another look at the primitive and it practically screamed a different meaning: <em>fit together</em> and <em>person</em>, i.e. Frankenstein's Monster. // The crowd came after the monster of Frankenstein with sabres!	My light<strong> saber</strong> has an <em>awl</em> setting. When I toggle the switch, the beam shrinks down to a little spike. My light<strong> saber</strong> becomes a light <em>awl</em>.		
険		precipitous	Pinnacle . . . awl.		11	1802	1672	43	ケン	けわ.しい	The edge of <em>The Pinnacle</em> is <strong>precipitous</strong>, so they have a guard posted with an <em>ice pick</em> to poke people and keep them from the edge.	Well I have someone climbing an inflatable<strong> precipitous</strong> <em>pinnacle</em>. Once at the top it is so<strong> precipitous</strong> that the person is afraid to climb down and instead punctures the inflatable <em>pinnacle</em> with an <em>awl</em> to get safely and slowly back to the ground.	Frankenstein is chased by the villagers up to the<strong> precipitous</strong> edge of the pinnacle. (ref 1671 astridtops).	The <em>Ice Climbers</em> enjoy<strong> precipitous</strong> climbs - and what better place to climb than the<strong> precipitous</strong> <em>Pinnacle</em>!	The rock climber trying to get up to the pinnacle is dangling from a<strong> precipitous</strong> edge, hanging only one with his icepick.		
検		examination	Tree . . . awl.		12	1803	1673	43	ケン	しら.べる	"You're giving a TREE an<strong> EXAMINATION</strong>. You take a wood sample from the TREE with an AWL (cmp <a href=""../v4/1278.html"">exam</a> (#1278 校))."	"Don't confuse with <a href=""../v4/1278.html"">exam</a> (#1278 校), <a href=""../v4/354.html"">test</a> (#354 試), <a href=""../v4/1487.html"">evaluate</a> (#1487 評). Think of<strong> examination</strong> as a doctor's<strong> examination</strong>. You're having problems getting <em>wood</em> in bed. You go in for a doctor's<strong> examination</strong>. The doctor shoves an <em>icepick</em> into your manhood as part of the<strong> examination</strong>."	"After intense cross-<strong>examination</strong> from the prosecutor, the <em>tree</em> confessed to murdering the <em>wood</em>-pecker with an <em>awl</em>… ""He just kept at it, he kept poking at me with that beak, so I thought I'd see how HE liked it!!"" The autopsy<strong> examination</strong> revealed at least a dozen puncture wounds, what a brutal case."	"The doctor gives a physical<strong> examination</strong> to <em>Frankenstein's Monster.</em> The monster is so big the doctor has to use a <em>tree</em> to hit his knee and check his reflexes. (I am using astridtops' primitive of <em>Frankenstein's Monster</em> (fit (together) and person) in place of ""awl"")."	"Patient goes to see the doctor for an<strong> examination</strong>. he says ""Everytime i walk i fart"". Doc asks him to take a few steps and he farts constantly. Docs puzzled and has never seen this before. He asks him to repeat and it happens again. So the doc tells him to go to the examinatino area and take his pants off. He then gets out a giant wooden awl slightly hooked at the end. What the f*<em>k are you going to do with that!? asks teh patient. ""Open the windows, it f</em>cking stinks in here!"" replies the doc."		
倹		frugal	Person . . . awl.		10	1804	1674	43	ケン	つま.しい、つづまやか	<em>Mr. T</em> is as <strong>frugal</strong> as they come. He uses his one <em>ice pick</em> for everything: to eat, pick his teeth, clean his toilet, kill people, cook, etc.	<em>Mr. T</em> is so <strong>frugal</strong>, he hires <em>Frankenstein</em> as a butler because he doesn't have to pay him.	Mr T is a<strong> frugal</strong> person in spite of his brash appearance. He brings an awl with him to fight for the A team, not wasting needless ammo and dynamite, since no one ever gets killed anyway in A team series.	"Some <em>n00b</em> spent all the club's money, so <em>Haruhi</em> teaches him how to be<strong> frugal</strong> (see <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1671"">sabre/saber</a> (#1671 剣)."			
重		heavy	<i>Thousand</i> . . . <i>ri</i>. Note how the long vertical stroke doubles up to serve both elements.		9	1805	1675	43	ジュウ、チョウ	え、おも.い、おも.り、おも.なう、かさ.ねる、かさ.なる、おも	The first computer in the world was as<strong> heavy</strong> as thousand computers are now.	"To me it looks like a car with two extra wheels, like a truck. As it is a very<strong> heavy</strong> vehicle I suggest an image of a huge mining truck, like the yellow Liebherr T282B.

A<strong> heavy</strong> duty <em>truck</em> with four-wheel drive.		
動		move	Heavy . . . muscle.		11	1806	1676	43	ドウ	うご.く、うご.かす	Even though the furniture is <em>heavy</em>, it'll be easy to<strong> move</strong> with all the <em>muscles</em> that he has.	His MUSCLES are so HEAVY, he barely can<strong> move</strong>…thats ironic.	Heavy things can be<strong> move</strong>d with a bit of muscle.	To<strong> move</strong> something heavy, you need muscles.	Everyone knows that (Force x Mass= acceleration), and as is typical when converting western expressions to eastern expressions this kanji gives us the same equation in reverse order and pictorialized: (Heavy x Muscle =<strong> Move</strong>). ;-p easy peasy.		
腫		tumor	Flesh . . . heavy.		13	1807	2467	43	シュ、ショウ	は.れる、は.れ、は.らす、く.む、はれもの	A<strong> tumor</strong> is a useless <em>body part</em> that is nothing but <em>heavy</em>.	The world's <em>heaviest</em><strong> tumor</strong> ever removed from a human body was a 300-pound stomach<strong> tumor</strong>, removed in 1991 in Stanford Hospital. Now that's a <em>heavy body part</em>!	When <em>flesh</em> clumps together and gets <em>heavy</em>, it forms a<strong> tumor</strong>.	You've got a<strong> tumor</strong> on your <em>flesh</em>? That's <em>heavy</em>, man.	The FLESH of a<strong> TUMOR</strong> is HEAVIER than normal FLESH.		
勲		meritorious deed	<i>Move</i> . . . <i>oven fire</i>. So as not to confuse this kanji with the general character for <i>merit</i> (Frame 1369), you may associate the key word with military decorations and medals of distinction, both of which it is used for.		15	1808	1677	43	クン	いさお	A<strong> meritorious deed</strong>? Like moving a damsel in distress out of a fire, maybe.	Prometheus did a meritous deed for humanity by MOVING FIRE from the gods to us humans.	Oskar Schindler is best remembered for his<strong> meritorious deed</strong>: moving 1200 Jews to his factory so that they could be saved from the fires of Auschwitz.	"(from Raichu) The classic<strong> meritorious deed</strong> is saving a damsel in distress from a burning building. You hear her sweet voice crying ""help! help!"" from inside. But when you get inside, you see that she's quite heavy… you'll need some muscles for this deed."	You get a medal if you do some <strong>meritorious deed</strong> in combat. When the shooting starts, some freeze and cannot <em>move</em>. The normal ones can move under <em>fire</em>. But the REAL medal winners are the ones that move over <em>flames</em>!. Not that is a <strong>meritorious deed</strong>!		
働		work	<i>Person</i> . . . <i>move</i>.

Mr Ts new exercise video called ""Work it suckaz"". Here is shouting ""move it<strong> work</strong> it move<strong> work</strong> it!""."

"In his poor days, <em>Mister T</em>, thanks to his healthy build, used to<strong> work</strong> as a (furniture) <em>mover</em> (Br. ""removal man"").

種		species	Wheat . . . heavy.		14	1810	1679	43	シュ	たね、-ぐさ	After the whole low-carb craze, scientists developed a new low-carb<strong> species</strong> of <em>wheat</em>, so that dieters could eat it without getting <em>heavier</em>.	"This kanji also means ""Seed."" STORY: Scientists have developed a new<strong> SPECIES</strong> of WHEAT that has large HEAVY seeds. Now we can feed the world."	The <em>heavy wheat</em> is a special type or<strong> species</strong> of wheat used to fatten livestock.	This is also the word for <strong>seed</strong>. Wheat seeds are sorted by how heavy they are.	The hot chick from <strong>Species</strong> has been eating a lot of <em>bread</em> lately, and she's really gotten <em>heavy</em>.		
衝		collide	Boulevard . . . heavy.		15	1811	1680	43	ショウ	つ.く	Two <em>heavy trucks</em> in a game of chicken <strong>collide</strong> while racing toward each other on the <em>boulevard</em>.	Something <em>heavy</em> rolling down the middle of the <em>boulevard</em> is definitely going to end up <strong>colliding</strong> with something.	衝 【しょう】 (n) (1) important point (e.g. on a route); (2) important role (responsibility, etc.); (3) (astronomical) opposition. STORY:Two HEAVY trucks are playing a game of chicken on the BOULEVARD. However, they both missed the IMPORTANT POINT: that they have to turn in different directions. Naturally, they<strong> COLLIDE</strong> when they both turn in the same direction. (ty dingomick).	Two heavy sumo wrestlers, in normal clothing while shopping, see each other at opposite sides of the boulevard and suddenly get in their stance and charge at each other until they<strong> collide</strong>, knocking everyone else out of the way.	The LHC (Large Hadron <strong>Collider</strong>) is as wide as a <em>boulevard</em> and so <em>heavy</em> that machinery had to be used to assemble the pieces.		
薫		fragrant	<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>heavy</i> . . . <i>oven fire</i>. Do not confuse with <i>incense</i> (Frame 977) or <i>perfumed</i> (Frame 532).		16	1812	1681	43	クン	かお.る	"Do you know how they make those<strong> FRAGRANT</strong> air fresheners? Well you take some FLOWERS, compress them with a HEAVY weight, and put them on an OVEN FIRE for a while… (cmp <a href=""../v4/493.html"">perfume</a> (#493 芳))."	The heavier the flowers the stronger their fragrance when you burn them.	These <em>flowers</em> emit very <em>heavy</em> <strong>fragrance</strong> when burned <em>over the fire</em> (e.g. the <strong>fragrant</strong> jasmine flowers).	(クン) Steve Jobs does it again. This heavy duty mac computer has a place for flowers on top. When the computer heats up (the fire on the bottom), the flowers release a beautiful<strong> fragrant</strong> smell.	As the <em>heavy duty truck</em> smolders in <em>flames</em>, the<strong> fragrant</strong> smell of <em>flowers</em> is emitted from the pine tree air freshener still hanging from the rear-view mirror.		
病		ill	Sickness . . . third class.		10	1813	1682	44	ビョウ、ヘイ	や.む、-や.み、やまい	<em>Caveman</em> got <strong>ill</strong> after flying <em>third class</em>. The cabin air and food got to him. (Primitive: these all got MUCH easier when using <em>CAVEMAN</em> instead. ).	If you hang around a <em>third class</em> hospital, you'll get<strong> ill</strong> with the <em>sickness</em> everyone else has.

I have this female friend who complains about <em>third class</em> type stuff a lot. She'll say stuff like ''That train ride made me<strong> ill</strong>. Seriously,'' and ''Oh my god, sitting next that dirty guy made me<strong> ill</strong>. Seriously.'' Sometimes I just want to kick her in the cunt.	Hint: The<strong> ill</strong> in<strong> ill</strong> almost looks like the roman numeral <strong>III</strong>. Use as a hint to 3rd class. The<strong> ill</strong> are more abundant in <em>third class</em> countries (<em>third world</em>).		
痴		stupid	Know . . . sickness.		13	1814	1683	44	チ	し.れる、おろか	Of course <em>caveman</em> is <strong>stupid</strong>. He doesn't <em>know</em> anything. He's a <em>caveman</em>!	"This kanji shows<strong> stupid</strong>ity as a ""<em>knowledge-sickness</em>"". Everybody can be<strong> stupid</strong> at times, and it usually happens because of a lack of experience. Hence the<strong> stupid</strong>ity is a ""<em>knowledge sickness</em>""."	"Ever since reading dingomick's story, I've had this dialogue stuck in my head when I come across the keyword: ""<em>Caveman</em> not<strong> stupid</strong>, <em>Caveman</em> <em>know</em> things.""."	You mean you didn't <em>know</em> you'd get <em>sick</em> living in an <em>icy cave</em>? Are you<strong> stupid</strong>?	<strong>Stupidity</strong> is a common <em>illness</em> that afflicts everyone. It is said to cause a lack of <em>knowledge</em>.		
痘		pox	Sickness . . . beans.		12	1815	1684	44	トウ		<em>Caveman</em> has horrible <strong>pox</strong>. They look like edamame <em>beans</em> oozing bight green paste.	<strong>Pox</strong> is a <em>sickness</em> which symptoms include <em>bean</em>-shaped bumps on the skin.	"<em>Mr. Bean</em> tries to explain to the <em>caveman</em> that he is covered in chicken<strong> pox</strong> and not to come near him, but the <em>caveman</em> misunderstands and eats him. ""THIS CHICKEN<strong> POX</strong> NOT TASTE GOOD.""."	<strong>Pox</strong> is a very contagious <em>sickness</em>, you'll get it just by sitting at the same table as someone infected.	The <em>Geico caveman</em> gets chicken<strong> pox</strong>. The doctor says the only cure is to take a bath in <em>baked beans</em>.		
症		symptoms	Sickness . . . correct.		10	1816	1685	44	ショウ		Once you have all the<strong> symptoms</strong> right, you have <em>correctly </em> identified the <em>sickness</em>.	A <em>sickness</em> can only be <em>correctly</em> diagnosed if the<strong> symptoms</strong> are identified <em>correctly</em>.	One of the<strong> SYMPTOMS</strong> of being a CAVEMAN is you don't get much CORRECT in a test.	"Doctor: ""let's go over your<strong> symptoms</strong>, <em>caveman</em>., shall we? Do you have a stuffy nose?"" Caveman: ""correct"". Doctor: ""Does your throat hurt?"" Caveman: ""correct"". Doctor: ""well, caveman, it sounds like you have a cold!""."	Checking the<strong> symptoms</strong> helps to identify the <em>correct</em> <em>sickness</em>.		
瘍		carbuncle	Sickness . . . piggy bank.		14	1817	3026	44	ヨウ	かさ	The witches <em>piggy bank</em> was cursed with a spell causing any thief who stole it's contents to fall ill. The <em>illness</em> would result in the victim being covered from head to toe in a mass of <strong>carbuncles</strong>. Crime doesn't pay!	<em>Caveman</em> has to open up his <em>piggy bank</em> to receive treatment for his monstrous <strong>carbuncle</strong>.	His <em>sickness</em> caused numerous<strong> carbuncle</strong>s, which when emptied by the doctors also emptied his <em>piggy bank</em>.	In this kanji the <em>Caveman</em> has a <em>piggy bank</em>-shaped<strong> carbuncle</strong> under his skin. Hmm, well, at least it looks kind of unique.	There goes the lonely miser, all covered in <strong>CARBUNCLE</strong>s. The local lore says that his hideous <em>ILLNESS</em> is divine retribution for his avarice: the <strong>CARBUNCLE</strong>s are said to be shaped like <em>PIGGY BANK</em>s!		
痩		lose weight	Sickness . . . monkey . . . crotch.		15	1818	2577	44	ソウ、チュウ、シュウ、シュ	や.せる	The <em>sickness</em> that only allows you to eat <em>monkey crotch</em> will surely make you<strong> lose weight</strong>.	<em>Caveman</em> want to<strong> lose weight</strong>… but not know how. He sees a lean <em>monkey</em> playing with its <em>crotch</em>. Ah! So that's how I<strong> lose weight</strong>, and he imitates the monkey.	Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, the precursor to HIV, is a <em>sickness</em> that is transmitted by carnal knowledge of a <em>monkey's crotch</em>. Naturally, it causes one to<strong> lose weight</strong>. <em>Cavemen</em> used to catch it all the time.	The poor <em>monkey</em> obviously had a <em>sickness</em>. He was scratching his <em>crotch</em> the whole time and when he started to<strong> lose weight</strong> heavily, the caretakers knew they couldn't save him anymore.	The most horrific way to<strong> lose weight</strong> is from that devastating sickness that came from a monkey's crotch.		
疾		rapidly	"Be sure to keep this character distinct from <i>quick</i> (Frame 1799) and <i>swift</i> (Frame 298). Picture a succession of poison <i>darts</i> (the sort that inflict <i>sickness</i>) flying out <b>rapid</b>-fire from a blowgun, so that ""<b>rapid</b>-fire"" can conjure up the proper image."		10	1819	1686	44	シツ	はや.い	I picture a sick caveman, and two people<strong> rapidly</strong> blowing darts at him. One is blowing poison darts, the other is blowing antidote darts. Will the sick caveman live or die? Depends on how<strong> rapidly</strong> they fire.	If shot with a <em>poison dart</em>, <em>sickness</em> develops<strong> rapidly</strong>.	"Hm, it's getting tougher to differentiate similar kanji: <a href=""../v4/280.html"">swift</a> (#280 迅), <a href=""../v4/1146.html"">hurry</a> (#1146 急), <a href=""../v4/1669.html"">quick</a> (#1669 速). Let's consider<strong> rapidly</strong> as a <strong>rapid</strong>-fire weapon: rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat. This weapon fires poison <em>darts</em><strong> rapidly</strong> in an automatic rapid-fire fashion. The poison darts are not lethal; they merely induce <em>sickness</em> in the victims."	The <em>sick caveman</em> is deteriorating <strong>rapidly</strong> from the <strong>rapid</strong>-fire gun that shot hime with <em>sickening</em> poison <em>darts</em>.	See book.		
嫉		envy	Woman . . . rapidly.		13	1820	2202	44	シツ	そね.む、ねた.む、にく.む	If you go through <em>women</em> <em>rapidly</em> you will be the object of<strong> envy</strong>.	Ah, puberty … the girl that starts her journey towards <em>womanhood</em> the most <em>rapidly</em> will become the subject of<strong> envy</strong> from all her classmates.	<strong>Envy</strong> (from FMA) is a boy homunculus (though a bit androgynous), but when they dubbed FMA to English, they somehow snipped his pickle and turned him into a <em>girl</em>. Wave of protests from hardcore fans emerged <em>rapidly</em>.	<em>Women</em> get envious very rapidly. Picture one <em>woman</em> walking into a party in a gorgeous dress, and all other <em>women</em> there rapidly getting envious of her beautiful dress.	WOMEN are full of<strong> envy</strong>. It's a Cupid thing– when one is hit with a dart of love, another's hit with a dart of<strong> envy</strong>, a kind of sickness that RAPIDLY infects everything she does.		
痢		diarrhea	Sickness . . . profit.		12	1821	1687	44	リ		For a country full of pay-per-use public toilets, sudden<strong> diarrhea</strong> is certainly the most <em>profitable sickness</em>!	<em>Caveman</em> doesn't have any skills, so he sells his <strong>diarrhea</strong> as <em>chili</em> to peasant wheat farmers for an amazing <em>profit</em>.	<strong>Diarrhea</strong> is a <em>sickness</em> that makes <em>wheat</em> go through me like a <em>saber</em>.	1. Give Caveman<strong> diarrhea</strong> 2. ??? 3. PROFIT!	<em>Caveman</em> sells his<strong> diarrhea</strong> to McDonalds so they can make shit burgers. The <em>caveman</em> turns a huge <em>profit</em> from his <em>sickness</em>.		
痕		scar	Sickness . . . silver.		11	1822	2578	44	コン	あと	I suffer from <em>silver-sickness</em>, that is, if anything made of silver even touches my skin it leaves a<strong> scar</strong>.	<em>Caveman</em> has a<strong> scar</strong> because he was shot with a <em>silver</em> bullet when he was mistaken for a werewolf.	I got <em>sick</em> and needed surgery, but the <em>silver</em> lining is that now I have these awesome<strong> scar</strong>s I can show off!	"<em>silver</em> nitrate will burn away <em>sick</em> tissue, but it will leave a<strong> scar</strong>. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nitrate#Medicine"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nitrate#Medicine</a>)."	That silverware had cut my skin, it got infected and i fell ill and even when it healed it left a permanent<strong> scar</strong>.		
疲		tired	Sickness . . . pelt.		10	1823	1688	44	ヒ	つか.れる、-づか.れ、つか.らす	I picture an <strong>exhausted</strong> <em>sick caveman</em> snuggling up in a <em>comfy pelt blanket</em>.	Your body feels<strong> tired</strong> when you have a sickness. All you want to do is wrap yourself up in a nice warm pelt and get better.	<em>Caveman</em> was <strong>tired</strong> after hauling mammoth <em>pelts</em> all day.	Being<strong> tired</strong> is a simple <em>sickness</em> that can treated by covering oneself with a <em>pelt</em> and resting well! (Thanks inuki).	I'm <em>sick</em> and <strong>tired</strong> of all these motherf~~ing <em>pelts</em> in all these motherf~~ing kanji.		
疫		epidemic	Sickness . . . missile.		9	1824	1689	44	エキ、ヤク		"<em>Sickness-missiles</em> are being engineered by bio-terrorists to spread<strong> epidemic</strong>s all over the world. Imagine seeing footage of a place where those<em> sickness-missiles</em> are built : rows after rows of <em>missiles</em>, and if you look closely on each is inscribed in tiny letters the name of different <em>sickness</em> such as ""flu"", ""plague"", etc."	SICKNESS / MISSILE ** Hint: True fact about biochemical warfare: in the medieval and ancient world, SICKNESS in the form of the corpses of those who had died from some<strong> EPIDEMIC</strong> or plague were often hurled at the enemy via the crude MISSILE launchers of the time. [C].	When CAVEMAN first fashions a primitive MISSILE and kills a mammoth with it, the technique spreads like an<strong> EPIDEMIC</strong> across the inhabited world.	An<strong> EPIDEMIC</strong> is a SICKNESS that hits like MISSLES.	When a <em>sick caveman</em> sneezes, the germs shoot out of his mouth like a <em>missile</em>. Ironically, this biological <em>missile</em> is much more deadly than any spear the <em>caveman</em> could throw, especially if it results in an <strong>epidemic</strong>.		
痛		pain	Sickness . . . chop-seal . . . utilize.		12	1825	1690	44	ツウ	いた.い、いた.む、いた.ましい、いた.める	The CAVEMAN felt such a<strong> pain</strong> after his POGO STICK got stuck in his butt.	When I was feeling <em>sick</em> my mum said I shouldn't go out to play on my <em>pogo stick</em> until I felt better. Well I wasn't strong enough to stay up on it and so fell over and have the<strong> pain</strong> to prove my mum right.	<em>Caveman</em> feels no<strong> pain</strong> (since he was frozen for so long his<strong> pain</strong> sensors are numbed). Here we see some kids using a <em>pogo stick</em> to jump on his hand.	Think of the phrase<strong> pain</strong> in the xxx. Then think of a <em>pogostick</em> up your xxx. That's<strong> pain</strong>ful, right? The real question is why a <em>pogostick</em> is up your xxx. That's <em>sick</em>, dude.	It causes me great<strong> pain</strong> to <em>utilize</em> my <em>chopseal</em> to pay for all of my wife's bills due to her shopping <em>sickness</em>.		
癖		mannerism	Sickness . . . ketchup.		18	1826	1691	44	ヘキ	くせ、くせ.に	<em>Caveman</em> has a bad <strong>mannerism</strong> of putting <em>ketchup</em> on everything he eats. I guess that's ok since raw mammoth can't be too good…	This <strong>mannerism</strong> is a <em>sickness</em> of the modern generation. It was only recently that we started putting <em>ketchup</em> on everything.	Building on inuki's idea: Monk, who suffers from OCD (a <em>sickness</em> involving <strong>mannerisms</strong>) sees a row of <em>ketchup</em> bottles at a restaurant crime scene and spends twenty minutes making the Heinz labels face exactly the same direction.	Sufferer from OCD (a <em>sickness</em> involving <strong>mannerisms</strong>) places thousands of drops of ketchup on his food in intricate patterns.	A SICK<strong> MANNERISM</strong> is putting KETCHUP on everything.		
匿		hide	Box . . . young.		10	1827	1692	44	トク	かくま.う	<em>Young</em> kids likes to <strong>hide</strong> in <em>cardboard boxes</em>. (Primitive: <em>CARDBOARD BOX</em>, especially kids playing with them.).	Note that stroke order with <em>box</em> primitive is as follows: first horizontal line, then enclosed element, and then a hook (it's incorrect in 4th edition).	This kanji doesn't really mean <strong>hide</strong> in the sense of<strong> hide</strong> and seek. It is more towards the meaning of hiding one's identity. ————————–AKA <strong>anonymity</strong>———– Schools are getting so strict now about personal identity, that they make <em>young</em> children keep <strong>anonymity</strong> by making them wear <em>cardboard</em> boxes over there heads.	Primitive = Solid Snake. <em>Solid Snake</em><strong> hide</strong>s in a <em>cardboard box</em> so he wont be detected. He's loved hiding in boxes ever since he was <em>young</em>.	"When I was YOUNG I used to play to<strong> hide</strong> and seek ….Everything was good for that : even and old BOX . I was quite innocent at that time …. Later I learned games of adult : especially lies and conceal one's feelings…. NB : In order to avoid confusion with <a href=""../v4/1313.html"">conceal</a> (#1313 隠)<strong> hide</strong> is given a material meaning while conceal will be more intellectual …. The background of youth strenghten this conception."		
匠		artisan	Box . . . ax.		6	1828	1693	44	ショウ	たくみ	Most people don't know that one of the most revered <strong>artisan</strong>s in Japan preserves the ancient art of cutting <em>cardboard boxes</em> with an <em>ax</em>.	The axe murderer considered himself an<strong> artisan</strong> for how his tastefully chopped up his victims and arranged their remains artfully in boxes.	We here have the axe-man who's an<strong> artisan</strong> at making sculptures with his axe… The only thing is, he never shows anyone, keeping all his sculptures inside a box down in the basement. He doesn't want any attention.	Hint:<strong> Artisan</strong>/Ax Def: An<strong> artisan</strong> is a skilled manual worker; a craftsperson. Here we see his tools represented by the<strong> artisan</strong>'s <em>ax</em> stored in his tool<em>box</em>.	The tool <em>box</em> of the<strong> artisan</strong> has an <em>axe</em> within.		
医		doctor	Box . . . dart.		7	1829	1694	44	イ	い.やす、い.する、くすし	The <strong>doctor</strong> puts the <em>cardboard box</em> on his head and throws a <em>dart</em> at a chart to determine his patients' illnesses.	This<strong> DOCTOR</strong> prefers to use DARTS instead of syringes for injections. Here, he pulls out his BOX of DARTS, and the child on the examination table squirms.	The<strong> doctor</strong> is tired of seeing one patient after another wanting vaccinations, so he steps into the waiting room with a big <em>box</em> full of <em>darts</em> loaded with the medicine. Bam, bam, bam, all done.	"A<strong> doctor</strong> is someone who keeps a <em>box</em> full of poison-<em>dart</em>-like syringes. (Careful not to mix up with <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/47"">Dr.</a> (#47 博), from waaay back in lesson 3. This is ""doctor"" as a profession, where as ""Dr."" is a title.)."	This<strong> doctor</strong> is carrying her <em>syringes</em> around in a nice portable <em>cardboard box</em>.		
匹		equal	Box . . . human legs.		4	1830	1695	44	ヒツ	ひき	This kanji is used commonly as a <strong>counter for small animals</strong>. This is a pictograph of a SMALL ANIMAL'S view from inside a CARDBOARD BOX looking out at his masters HUMAN LEGS. He's probably hiding so the master does not COUNT him with the other animals which will probably be eaten (thus he avoids everyones<strong> EQUAL</strong> fate on the farm: the kitchen table).	Put a <em>box</em> over everyone's heads, letting only the <em>legs</em> show, and we all look pretty much<strong> equal</strong>.	Imagine a magician doing that trick where he puts his assistant in a <em>box</em> and proceeds to saw her in half. Don’t the <em>human legs</em> sticking horizontally out of the <em>box</em> remind you of an<strong> equal</strong> sign?	Four minus one stroke is<strong> equal</strong> to..?	<em>4 - 1</em> <strong>=</strong> this kanji.		
区		ward	The <b>ward</b> referred to here is a subdivision of a large city. Its elements: <i>box</i> . . . <i>sheaves</i>. When used as a primitive element, it may be helpful at times to break it up into these same composite elements.		4	1831	1696	44	ク、オウ、コウ		That's the homeless <strong>ward</strong> of the city. <em>Wolverine</em> lives in a <em>cardboard box</em> there.	In the<strong> ward</strong> office the <em>sheaves</em> of paper of the<strong> ward</strong> registration forms are kept in a <em>box</em>.	In the Akihabara<strong> ward</strong>, it is mandated that every resident own an X-BOX (well more like a PS3 but you get the point).	This is a special<strong> ward</strong> at the hospital for bad crops, where the farmers gently bring in their <em>sheaves</em> tucked away in little <em>boxes</em> for treatment, the poor things.	X man lives in a small BOX apartment in Shibuya<strong> WARD</strong>.		
枢		hinge	Tree . . . ward.		8	1832	1697	44	スウ、シュ	とぼそ、からくり	The <strong>hinge</strong> on <em>Wolverine's</em> <em>cardboard box</em> is made of wood because he doesn't have enough budget to buy metal <strong>hinge</strong>s.	You notice a<strong> hinge</strong> on a <em>tree</em> and realize there's a secret door. You open it up to find an <em>Xbox</em>!!!	The<strong> hinge</strong> in this hospital <em>ward</em> was made of <em>wood</em> because they didn't have enough budget to buy metal<strong> hinge</strong>s.	"I like using ""X Box"" as the primitive instead of ward. The first <em>X Box</em> had a lot of problems. I guess Microsoft was in a hurry to get it out. I even noticed that the<strong> hinge</strong>s were made of <em>wood</em>… what the hell?"	Make sure you install the<strong> hinge</strong> the right way. If it opens <em>treeward</em> (= <em>tree</em> <em>ward</em>), you won't be able to get the fence open, make sure it opens houseward.		
殴		assault	Ward . . . missile.		8	1833	1698	44	オウ	なぐ.る	The city decides to disperse the <em>homeless ward</em> with a precision <em>missile</em> <strong>assault</strong>. They didn't know <em>Wolverine</em> was living in a <em>cardboard box</em> there though…	The biggest<strong> assault</strong> on Japan during WW2 is when the <em>wards</em> in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were wiped out by nuclear <em>missiles</em>.	In this hospital <em>ward</em>, the personnel is<strong> assault</strong>ed by <em>missiles</em>. Think of a <em>ward</em> where crazy old people<strong> assault</strong> the personnel because they don't like the food, they don't want to take their medicines, they want to go home, etc. The patients use whatever they can get their hands on as <em>missiles</em>.	Kids these days are just<strong> assault</strong>ed by violent games. Just look at these <em>X-Box</em> games - they all have <em>missiles</em> in them! Even Barbie Horse Adventure!	Best game of the year award goes to…. MISSLE<strong> ASSAULT</strong> for the XBOX! What a great game :-D.		
欧		Europe	<i>Ward</i> . . . <i>yawn</i>. Like the kanji of frame 1776, this character is an abbreviation of the name of a geographical region.		8	1834	1699	44	オウ	うた.う、は.く	"""<strong>Europe</strong>? <em>Yawn…</em> I've been to every <em>ward</em>(country/area),"" says <em>Wolverine</em> interviewed from his <em>cardboard box</em>."	[Europe] <em>X-Box</em> was first released in America and Japan (the biggest videogame markets). <strong>Europe</strong> had an <em>X-Box</em> <em>lack</em> for a while…	Do japanese consider<strong> Europe</strong> like just a <em>ward</em>, boring enough to make them <em>yawn</em>?? This kanji is offensive!	The <strong>EU</strong> <em>lacks</em> separate economic <em>wards</em>.	The <em>X-Box</em> wasn't a big hit in<strong> Europe</strong>. They took one look at it and collectively <em>yawn</em>ed.		
抑		repress	Fingers . . . box . . . stamps.		7	1835	1700	44	ヨク	おさ.える	A true <em>stamp</em> collecting nerd won't be able to<strong> repress</strong> the urge to get his <em>fingers</em> on the latest <em>box</em> of collector <em>stamps</em>!	They would <strong>repress</strong> dissents by cutting off their <em>fingers</em> and mailing them to relatives in <em>small boxes</em> (of course including <em>stamps</em> for proper postage).	"A chikan (bus-molester) tries to<strong> repress</strong> his <em>finger</em>-groping desire by refusing to travel by bus anymore. Instead, he seals himself in a <em>box</em>, makes sure there are enough <em>postage stamps</em> on the outside, and mails himself. He's a good man at heart , you see… just a bit of a slave to his libido. (I suggest using this same Chikan as the primitive for the ""box and stamp"" combo on the right side of this kanji, which come up more than once later on)."	I'm just gonna say what we're all thinking. Young women work hard to<strong> repress</strong> their urges to put their <em>fingers</em> in their <em>boxes</em> because if their mothers found out, they could be <em>stamped</em> with a big WHORE stamp across their faces for the rest of their lives. Such a stamping is avoided by severe <strong>repression</strong>.	The right side is a rabbit ( 卯 ) that has lost one ear. He (I'm thinking of a cartoony rabbit who has lost the ear in some battle with an enemy) has to<strong> repress</strong> (concretely, with his fingers!) his urge to revenge, which is hard to contain in his little head.		
仰		faceup	This character is used both for lying on one's back <b>faceup</b>, and for looking up to someone with respect and awe. Its elements: <i>person</i> . . . <i>box</i> . . . <i>stamps</i>.		6	1836	1701	44	ギョウ、コウ	あお.ぐ、おお.せ、お.っしゃる、おっしゃ.る	All <em>stamps</em> in <em>Mr T</em>'s collection <em>box</em> are lied carefully <strong>face-up</strong>.	Mr T with the post package at the post office: 'these stamps don't stick to the box, foo' Postguy:' Try it again but this time with the stamp,<strong> face-up</strong>.'.	<em>Chuck Norris</em> always plays poker with his cards<strong> face-up</strong> because he can't be beat anyway. Try and cheat and you'll end up the recipient of a roundhouse kick to the head and will leave the room in a <em>box</em> with a <em>stamp</em> addressed to the local morge.	A person who is a <em>stamp</em> collector has all of the <em>stamps</em><strong> face-up</strong> in their box.	"If you're using ""chikan"" for the small box + stamp primitive, here's a story for you: chikan's trip in the small box with the stamps all over it is getting boring… good thing he's laying<strong> face-up</strong> though and has a flashlight with him, because he's pasted pictures of Mr. T to the roof of the box. That's his idol who he looks up to in awe, and never grows tired of looking at him (this covers both meanings Heisig mentioned)."		
迎		welcome	Box . . . stamps . . . road.		7	1837	1702	44	ゲイ	むか.える	<em>Stamp-collectors</em> sit and wait on the <em>road</em> to <strong>welcome</strong> new mail arrivals.	The stamp collector goes out to the <em>road</em> to<strong> welcome</strong> the arrival of his new <em>stamp box</em>.	"I found a <em>small stamped box</em> on the <em>road</em>, and figured it wouldn't hurt to open it. As I opened it, I pricked myself on a small needle. Thinking nothing of it, I unfolded a note that read ""<strong>Welcome</strong> to the AIDS club!"". Fuck!"	I<strong> welcome</strong> the <em>box from Amazon</em> (a <em>box</em> with <em>stamps</em> on it) that has come a long <em>way</em>.	"Even though she was homeless and living in a <em>box</em> along the <em>road</em>, she <em>stamp</em>ed her ""home"" with the word ""<strong>welcome</strong>"". Hospitality can be found in the humblest of abodes."		
登		ascend	<i>Teepee</i> . . . <i>table</i>. Do not confuse with <i>rise up</i> (Frame 43).		12	1838	1703	44	トウ、ト、ドウ、ショウ、チョウ	のぼ.る、あ.がる	When an American Indian warrior dies, his body is placed on a TABLE inside a TEEPEE, and a ritualistic ceremony is held to encourage his spirit to<strong> ASCEND</strong> to that big buffalo hunting ground in the sky.	When I was a kid I went out camping in a teepee. I ate beans for dinner, and afterwards I produced so much gas that my teepee actually<strong> ascend</strong>ed in the air!	Stroke order for <em>teepee</em> primitive is incorrect (in 4th edition), 3rd and 4th strokes should be reversed.	<em>Mr Bean</em><strong> ascend</strong>s a <em>teepee</em>, which then collapses, flattening the American Indians trapped inside.	The smell of a <em>bean</em> fart<strong> ascend</strong>s up, up and out the top of the <em>teepee</em>.		
澄		lucidity	Water . . . ascend.		15	1839	1704	44	チョウ	す.む、す.ます、-す.ます	Scuba divers know that when you <em>ascend</em> in the <em>water</em>, your<strong> lucidity</strong> increases (For non-divers, the deeper you go, the more you become mentally impaired by nitrogen narcosis, every 50 feet is like drinking one martini). Scuba divers also know that as you <em>ascend</em> in the <em>water</em>, the<strong> lucidity</strong> of the <em>water</em> improves, too.	Lucid dreams allow me to control what is happening. In a drowning nightmare, I forced<strong> lucidity</strong> and allowed myself ascend to the surface.	A few <em>drops of acid/peyote</em> and the Indians obtain <strong>lucidity</strong> on their vision quest, as if they were floating in the <strong>lucid</strong> sky.	"The keyword refers to limpid <em>water</em>, but also to something that is clear (as in ""crystal clear""). In Buddhism the thinking mind is often compared to a pond : if you stir the <em>water</em>, the mud from the bottom mixes with the water, and the mind is ""muddy"". To attain<strong> lucidity</strong>, one has to let the mud settle, or as in this kanji, take a shortcut and just <em>ascend</em> through the <em>water</em>."	This kanji is also used for CLEAR WEATHER. Imagine the RAIN/WATER ASCENDING back up into the sky, and the clouds floating away, giving you CLEAR WEATHER. (it's like hitting rewind).		
発		discharge	This key word refers to the <b>discharging</b> of guns, trains, people, and even words. The elements: <i>teepee</i> . . . <i>two</i> . . . <i>human legs</i>. Contrast the writing with frame 63.		9	1840	1705	44	ハツ、ホツ	た.つ、あば.く、おこ.る、つか.わす、はな.つ	I spent some time in her TEEPEE…just the TWO of us…but I looked between her HUMAN LEGS and I saw a nasty<strong> DISCHARGE</strong>…so I made my 出発 rather hastily.	<em>Two pairs of human legs</em> poking out of a <em>teepee</em>: you know there'll be a<strong> discharge</strong> soon, be it sexual, violent (husband returns home with a weapon), or dishonourable (soldier caught molesting a native), or perhaps all of the above.	The indian chief went into his <em>teepee</em> and found his wife sleeping with a cowboy. He <strong>discharged</strong> his gun at the <em>two</em> people, and left with their <em>legs</em> <strong>discharging</strong> out the door.	The soldier was dishonorably<strong> discharge</strong>d when his commanding officer saw <em>two pairs of legs</em> sticking out of a <em>teepee</em> designed for just one soldier.	Hier sieht man den Akt, der neues Leben <strong>hervorbringen</strong> kann: Ein <em>Tipi</em>, und <em>zwei</em> Paar <em>Menschenbeine</em> ineinander verschlungen.		
廃		abolish	Cave . . . discharge.		12	1841	1706	44	ハイ	すた.れる、すた.る	I think <em>discharging</em> nuclear weapons should be<strong> abolish</strong>ed. That includes underground tests in <em>caves</em>. You listening Kim Jong-il?	Guns were <strong>abolish</strong>ed, so gun enthusiats left for the hills to <em>discharge</em> their guns in <em>caves</em>.	<em>Discharging</em> guns in <em>caves</em> was<strong> abolish</strong>ed because the ricochets were causing too many injuries.	When slavery was<strong> abolish</strong>ed, defiant slave owners knew they had lost the war but as an act of spite herded up all their slaves into a remote <em>cave</em> and killed them all by <em>discharging</em> bullets into their heads. (The dead bodies then <em>discharged</em> various substances/fluids as voluntary muscle control was suddenly gone.).	Slaves have been <em>discharged</em> from the <em>caves</em> where they were kept thanks to the <strong>abolition</strong> of slavery.		
僚		colleague	<i>Person</i> . . . <i>pup tent</i>. Choose some connotation of the key word that will keep it distinct for you from <i>companion</i> (Frame 19), <i>friend</i> (Frame 760), <i>consort</i> (Frame 1287), and <i>comrade</i> (Frame 1765).		14	1842	1707	44	リョウ		Trivia: The right primitive is <em>kagaribi</em> - 尞 - <em>fuel used for sacrifices</em>. I would use <em>sacred bonfire</em> as a primitive . (Mnemonic: Top is a merged image of <em>big</em> and <em>fire</em> - <em>big sacred bonfire</em> that looks like <em>little sun</em>). Story: Your<strong> colleague</strong> got fired literally… in a <em>sacred bonfire</em> by Mr.T.	Some businesses allow pets in the office. Here, my<strong> colleague</strong> is <em>Mr T</em> and he set up a little <em>pup tent</em> for his minidog, then turns around and completes his TPS reports.	"Mr. T began working in a japanese compagny. As he sees that his<strong> colleague</strong> accept to do some extra work during the week-end and even sleep at the office, he says to them: ""I pity da fool who work during week-end! You might as well install a pup tent in the office and forget about your home""."	"(リョウ) When Ned (<em>insert male person here</em>) gets a <em>pup tent</em> (i.e. a woody), he calls it his ""colleague."" (again, sorry for the crudeness of many of my stories)."	"A<strong> colleague</strong> implies someone that you share work with, such as in your company or profession, etc. Here your<strong> colleague</strong> helps you to erect your <em>pup tent</em> during a company outing. Note: <strong>Heisig's warning</strong> to keep this distinct from other similiar kanji such as <a href=""../v4/19.html"">companion</a> (#19 朋), <a href=""../v4/704.html"">friend</a> (#704 友), <a href=""../v4/1203.html"">consort</a> (#1203 伴) and <a href=""../v4/1637.html"">comrade</a> (#1637 輩). That is why I chose to have the <em>person</em> element pictured as someone (the<strong> colleague</strong> in this case) helping with the work of building the <em>pup tent</em>."		
瞭		obvious	Eye . . . pup tent.		17	1843	2582	44	リョウ	あきらか	I paint a huge <em>eye</em> on the side of my <em>pup tent</em>. Why? – It’s<strong> obvious</strong>: when I’m at the camping site it makes it<strong> obvious</strong> which tent is mine so I can quickly locate it.	RevTKers please, open your <em>eye</em>s!! That's not a puptent you see! It's <em>kagaribi</em> (尞), fuel used for sacrifices. I know it wasn't<strong> obvious</strong> at first, but I hope it's clear to you now! :D.	It's<strong> obvious</strong> that the <em>pup tent</em> with a huge <em>eye</em> on the side belongs to the dark lord Sauron.	It is<strong> obvious</strong> that you shouldn't be staring into <em>sacred bonfires</em> with your <em>eyes</em>.	Open your <em>eyes</em>, it's<strong> obvious</strong> that not all of us can fit into that small <em>puptent</em>!		
寮		dormitory	House . . . pup tent.		15	1844	1708	44	リョウ		This guy would rather use his <em>pup-tent</em> as a <em>house</em>, than sleep in the<strong> dormitory</strong>. So he effectively turned that <em>pup-tent</em> into a <em>house</em> by getting a postal address for it etc. (just to emphasize house).	"All-male <strong>dormitories</strong> in Japan are really weird, and tend to have a little too much 男気 . Here is a trick they play where if they find that one dorm member has pitched a ""<em>pup tent</em>"" while sleeping, they make it into a <em>house</em> by putting a little roof on top of it – complete with a lit cigarette for a chimney – and wait for the ""fun"" to start (fun meaning…lighting their friend's genitals on fire)."	A<strong> dormitory</strong> room has the same characteristics of a pup tent, meaning that it's small and usually sleeps two people (you and your room mate), however you have an actual roof over your head.	To please gods and pass next exams you set a whole<strong> dormitory</strong> (<em>house</em>) afire. Wow! What a <em>sacred bonfire</em>!	A<strong> DORMITORY</strong> HOUSE has all the same characteristics as a PUP TENT; smelly, old, cramped, etc.		
療		heal	Sickness . . . pup tent.		17	1845	1709	44	リョウ		In Final Fantasy 4, sleeping in a tent completely<strong> heal</strong>s you and recovers all your HP and MP (and cures any <em>sickness</em> your characters may have).	Sick caveman has to sleep in his pup tent. Not the cave because to humid and cold but a nice small pup tent in the sun will<strong> heal</strong> him from his cold.	There’s nothing like a little getting away from it all, pitching a PUP-TENT in a scenic place, kicking back, relaxing and drinking in nature’s beautiful medicine. It’s a great way to<strong> HEAL</strong> the SICKNESSes of modern life that afflict us.	The <em>sick caveman</em> asks gods to<strong> heal</strong> him (from a hangover) and sets a <em>sacred bonfire</em> in his cave.	On the battlefield, the only place to<strong> heal</strong> from your <em>sickness</em> is inside the medic's <em>pup tent</em>. Think of M.A.S.H.		
彫		carve	The two primitives here, <i>circumference</i> and <i>shape</i>, belong naturally to the special connotations that differentiate <b>carving</b> from <i>engraving</i> (see frame 1639).		11	1846	1710	45	チョウ	ほ.る、-ぼ.り	Start with a <em>circumference</em> and<strong> carve</strong> away until you get the <em>shape</em> you want.	[My primitive for <em>shape</em> is Mystique, the shape-shifter from X-Men.] <em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter<strong> carve</strong>s obscure markings around the <em>circumfrence</em> of her blue body.	(Primitive: <em>shape</em> - when you were three you played with <em>Play-Doh</em>.) 彫 : Did anyone else use the <em>circumference</em> of the <em>Play-Doh</em> container to<strong> carve</strong> circular <em>shapes</em>?	"HINT: There are a lot of good stories on this website using Bruce Lee as a primitive for <a href=""../v4/2008.html"">sign of the dragon</a> (#2008 辰), so you may want to avoid using him for shape. Mystique works well, as suggested by ayoung24."	HINT: To help me remember that 彡 leans the opposite way as ミ, I am calling that primitive <em>my evil twin</em>. It's <em>mi</em> from the mirror universe. You can also think of it as the three strokes of my evil twin's goatee. STORY: I know the witness saw me<strong> carve</strong> the entire <em>circumference</em> of the victim's skin, but it wasn't me, officer; it was <em>my evil twin</em>.		
形		shape	Two hands . . . shape.		7	1847	1711	45	ケイ、ギョウ	かた、-がた、かたち、なり	Everyone in the kindergarten came up with fun and interesting<strong> shape</strong>s made out of <em>Play-Doh</em>, except for the kid with the amputated arm. Seems like you <em>really need both hands</em>.	"With your <em>two hands</em>, outline the <em>shape</em> of a curvaceous woman. Is that a universally understood gesture? [Careful: <a href=""../v4/680.html"">mould</a> (#680 型) which has two hands and soil/clay]."	<em>Mystique</em> is in great<strong> shape</strong>! I wanna run my <em>two hands</em> over the<strong> shape</strong> of her body.	Of coure, a sculptor needs <em>both hands</em> to<strong> shape</strong> his works of art.	Two hands can make many<strong> shape</strong>s.		
影		shadow	Scenery . . . shape.		15	1848	1712	45	エイ	かげ	The <em>sun</em> over the <em>capital</em> cast a<strong> shadow</strong> with the same <em>shape</em>.	<em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter blends into the <em>scenery</em> by transforming into a form that looks like little more than an animated<strong> shadow</strong>.	You make some of the famous <em>scenery</em> of Kyoto out of <em>play-doh</em>, even going so far as to add some black play-doh to depict<strong> shadow</strong>.	"You're out hiking looking at the SCENERY, suddenly out of the corner of your vision you see a large<strong> SHADOW</strong>'s indistinct SHAPE… could it be a grizzly? (cmp <a href=""../v4/1592.html"">shade</a> (#1592 陰))."	Godzilla attacks! Tokyo's <em>scenery</em> is covered by the <em>shape</em> of Godzilla's<strong> shadow</strong> yet again.		
杉		cedar	Tree . . . shape.		7	1849	1713	45	サン	すぎ	<strong>Cedar</strong> is an evergreen tree that keeps its SHAPE all year long. That is, it doesn't loose its needles/leaves in the winter.	Mystique leaning against a<strong> cedar</strong> tree for a photo shoot.	Why do<strong> cedar</strong> trees keep their shape (don't lose their needles)? Because they're not real trees, they're made out of play-doh.	Mmmm,<strong> cedar</strong>-scented Play-Doh. Finally, a scent that doesn't make me want to vomit.	<em>Mystique</em> is leaning against a<strong> cedar</strong> <em>tree</em> for a sexy photo shoot, holding a lump of <em>cheddar</em> (it's for a cheese advert).		
彩		coloring	Vulture . . . tree . . . shape.		11	1850	1714	45	サイ	いろど.る	In Sydney we occasionally get exotic birds. You first notice a <strong>colouring</strong> in a <em>tree</em>. You look more carefully and you make out the <em>shape</em> of a bird (here represented by its <em>claws</em>).	<em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter changes the<strong> coloring</strong> of her skin to camouflage tones and perches herself in a <em>tree</em> like a <em>vulture</em> waiting for her pray.	<strong>warning:</strong> There is a mistake in the 4th edition, that's not a <em>fledgling</em> primitive on the left. It should be obvious but somehow I didn't notice it when I learned that one yesterday. v__v.	"A little kid about age 3 is<strong> coloring</strong> something that his teacher can't quite make out. It's just kind of a blob… an unknown shape. She asks, ""What's that?"" Of course, the child expects the teacher to know what it is and is offended that she didn't recognize what the shape/blob was. ""Don't you see it's a vulture in a tree!?"" Obviously very upset by this, the child's next drawing is of the vulture flying down from the tree and pecking the teacher to death."	When<strong> coloring</strong> something in you <em>grab</em> the crayon of choice to fill in the <em>shape</em>s.		
彰		patent	"<i>Badge</i> . . . <i>shape</i>. The key word is synonymous with ""clear"" or ""openly expressed."""		14	1851	1715	45	ショウ		The <em>shape</em> of a sheriff's <em>badge</em> makes it<strong> patent</strong> who he is.	<em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter sneaks into the<strong> patent</strong> office easily after she steals an identity <em>badge</em> from a security guard.	"Note: the keyword has nothing to do with trademarks and is to be understood in the sense of a ""public recognition"". However the kanji is not common, so getting the exact meaning is not a big deal."	YOU have the <strong>patent</strong> for <em>Playdoh</em>? That's <strong>patent</strong>ly false. See here, I have the <em>badge</em> of proof issued from the <strong>patent</strong> office.	It was<strong> patent</strong>ly absurd when the fellow tried to arrest me–his <em>badge</em> was the wrong <em>shape</em>: a <em>vase</em> and a <em>sunflower</em>? Come now.		
彦		lad	Vase . . . cliff . . . shape.		9	1852	1716	45	ゲン	ひこ	A young<strong> lad</strong> is <em>standing</em> atop a <em>cliff</em>, looking at the writhing <em>shape</em> of his fallen lass below.	A naughty young <strong>lad</strong> stands on the <em>cliff</em> and throws his <em>Playdoh</em> off the edge.	A<strong> lad</strong> <em>standing</em> on the top of a <em>cliff</em>, looking into the far, and thinking how to <em>shape</em> his future.	<em>Mystique</em> sneaks up behind a young security guard foolishly <em>stand</em>ing by a <em>cliff</em>. All it takes is a little push, almost playful, and she's free to assume his form. You made it too easy,<strong> lad</strong>.	"(See my story for 産 ""products"".) Someone is standing at the top of a cliff and urinating. You can tell it's a<strong> lad</strong> by his shape."		
顔		face	Lad . . . head.		18	1853	1717	45	ガン	かお	The <em>lad</em> jumps off the cliff, breaks his <em>head</em>, and smashes his<strong> face</strong>.	When I was a <em>lad</em>, a pretty<strong> face</strong> was all it took for someone to get in my <em>head</em>, and I'd fill <em>pages</em> of lovelorn letters to them.	"Ee gads!

Got that into your <em>head</em>?	You<strong> ought</strong> to like the <em>shape</em> of your <em>head</em> because you can't change it.	A little kid decorates his sleeping grandpa's <em>head</em> with <em>Play-Doh</em>: horns, moustache, boogers, earwax, moles.

It will begin to throb like a bass <em>drum</em> and will change <em>shape</em>.	If a PART OF your BODY begins to<strong> SWELL</strong> and resembles the SHAPE of a bass DRUM, you’re either pregnant or in desperate need of a diet.	"This kanji does not mean<strong> swell</strong> as in a inflammation. There is a different kanji for that meaning ( 腫れる ). This kanji means<strong> swell</strong> as in, a tire<strong> swell</strong>ing/expanding, your income<strong> swell</strong>ing/expanding, dough<strong> swell</strong>ing/expanding, etc. Johnskb's story is best b/c it does not involve<strong> swell</strong>ing in the sense of inflammation, just general expansion of the stomach. STORY: ""If a PART OF your BODY begins to<strong> SWELL</strong>/EXPAND and resembles the SHAPE of a bass DRUM, you’re either pregnant or in desperate need of a diet.""."	Which part of your body can change shape and, when it does,<strong> swell</strong>s up and throbs like a drumb? Hmmm…	<em>Mystique</em>'s tummy<strong> swell</strong>s into a big <em>drum</em>.

He broke his <em>elbow</em>, and it became really <em>big</em> and contorted into a weird <em>shape</em>. I hope he will be all right!	Whenever the postman has to pay a<strong> visit</strong> to this place, he brings an elbow-shaped thingy that he throws to the St. Bernard.	I paid a<strong> visit</strong> to my neighbour, but I forgot he had this huge <em>St. Bernard dog</em>. The doctor said my <em>elbow</em> will never be the same <em>shape</em>.	"I was a little nonplussed by the inappropriateness of this keyword, so I decided to use ""the three kings"" instead; they are a threesome, and they make a religiously-motivated<strong> visit</strong>, right? Anyway, they travel by night, so they're just these three shapes moving through the gloom. They can't see well, so a St. Bernard dog noses their elbows whenever they start to go the wrong way."	"Hint: This is the humble/old kanji of the verb ""to go/to come"", and also is the kanji for ""three"" on legal documents. I suggest using the ""three musketeers"" for this primitive, raising their three blades with the elbow. (the elbow primitive could be viewed as a pictograph of the musketeer's hat, with a feather on the side, too)."		
惨		wretched	A state of mind . . . visit.		11	1857	1721	45	サン、ザン	みじ.め、いた.む、むご.い	Whenever I have to <em>visit</em> the relatives… that puts me in one hell of a<strong> wretched</strong> <em>state of mind</em>.	Data feels<strong> wretched</strong> because he has no family to visit.	I don't know about you, but it seems to me that whenever I'm in a<strong> wretched</strong> <em>state of mind</em> and just want to be left alone, that's the time that other people always seem to decide to <em>visit</em> me!	Your state of mind at the end of the previous frame.	"<em>Data</em> felt <strong>wretched</strong> his visit to a ""third-world"" and seeing how <strong>wretched</strong> the people lived."

Note : the meaning is in the positive sense, to cultivate one's character or interests. To work to make yourself or something better.	You may not have known it, but Mr. T is into discispline. Not just self<strong> discipline</strong>, in order to get into shape, but what he really likes is when the Task master spanks him with her walking stick. Don't tell Mr. T I told you. I pity da fool, and da fool would be me!!!	"Compare with <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/958"">permanence/remote</a> (#958 悠). <em>Mr. T</em> went to visit his old <em>taskmaster</em> who had a <em>walking stick</em>. Halfway on the way to that remote region, <em>Mr. T</em> was about to give up because of the long and difficult journey when he ran into <em>Bruce Lee</em>, who told him that<strong> discipline</strong> is needed to reach your goal."	<em>Mr. T</em> joins the X-men. When they catch <em>mystique</em>, he beats her with a <em>walking stick</em> like a true <em>taskmaster</em> to<strong> discipline</strong> her. But it turns out mystique has taken the shape of the walking stick, and she then beats him.		
珍		rare	Jewel . . . umbrella . . . shape.		9	1859	1723	45	チン	めずら.しい、たから	The king has a really<strong> rare</strong> umbrella, it can change shape.	"Tip: <em>umbrella</em> + <em>shape</em> : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it may be worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest ""<em>parasol</em>"" (because it is the same <em>shape</em> as an <em>umbrella</em>). REF: <em>rare</em> (FRAME 1723) , <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1724"">check-up</a> (#1724 診), <a href=""../v4/2574.html"">measles</a> (#2574 疹), <a href=""../v4/2720.html"">fallible</a> (#2720 謬)."	"<em>Mystique</em> stole the<strong> rare</strong> <em>jewel</em>-encrusted <em>umbrella</em> by simply morphing into a <em>king</em>, marching into the palace and taking it. ""I'll be back, I'd like to take a quick stroll in the rain!' S/he said, and casually strolled off holding the umbrella (pictograph - you can see the umbrella over Mystique)."	It's<strong> rare</strong> to see the <em>king</em> carrying his own <em>parasol</em> - typically he gets one of his attendants to do it for him (thanks to Katsuo for <em>umbrella + shape = parasol</em> and to Peppi for the story idea).	The ancient <em>jewel</em> that is <em>shaped</em> like an <em>umbrella</em> is extremely<strong> rare</strong>, and so is hung from the chin (ちん) of the royal <em>king</em> of Mezura (めずら) to signify his importance.		
診		checkup	<i>Words</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>shape</i>. The key word refers to a medical examination.		12	1860	1724	45	シン	み.る	The doctor at my checkup was expressing words of concern about my umbrella shaped gut.	At a<strong> check-up</strong> the proctologist views an X-Ray. I <em>say</em>, is that <em>shape</em> an <em>umbrella</em>?	"Mystique goes to get a<strong> check-up</strong> and the doctors words cut her to the bone, ""I'm sorry Mystique but you've changed shape too many times, you'll be stuck as an umbrella forever""."	(Using Katsuo's umbrella+shape=parasol suggestion). The words giving the results of the STD ridden geisha's<strong> check-up</strong> are discreetly written on her parasol.	<strong>Check-up</strong> <em>result</em>: your blood is infested with an <em>umbrella shaped</em> parasite.		
文		sentence	Under the familiar <i>top hat</i> we see a crisscross pattern or design, like that found on woodwork or garments. This should make an ugly enough image to help remember it. It can be associated with <b>sentence</b> by thinking of a <b>sentence</b> as a grammatical pattern.	* The primitive meaning for this character will be <i>plaid</i>, the familiar crisscross pattern frequently used in textiles.	4	1861	1725	45	ブン、モン	ふみ、あや	A twist on greenapple: The teacher puts a tophat on all pupils with gramatically correct<strong> sentence</strong>s, while the rest are left with a big red X on their homework.	The teacher in the tophat puts an X on all the grammatically incorrect<strong> sentence</strong>s.	I celebrated finishing the Heisig books by buying myself a <em>plaid top hat</em> (<em>top hat</em> with <em>criss cross</em> pattern to symbolize the crisscrossing flashcards) and then I began the AJATT<strong> sentence</strong> method.	"It should not be a problem to see this as<strong> SENTENCE</strong>. For the primitive, think in a Scottish accent and say ""PLAID kilt"". Guess it can look like a Beret wearing scot."	I'm making <strong>sentence/plaid</strong> into a new primitive: <strong>Catholic schoolgirl</strong>. (This should be fun.) // All of the Catholic schoolgirls wear uniforms with <em>top hats</em> and <em>plaid</em> skirts, and sit in school practicing their<strong> sentence</strong>s.		
対		vis-à-vis	Plaid . . . glue.		7	1862	1726	45	タイ、ツイ	あいて、こた.える、そろ.い、つれあ.い、なら.ぶ、むか.う	When sitting <strong>vis-a-vis</strong>, <em>Scots</em> will <em>glue</em> their <em>kilt</em> down to avoid embaressment.	"This is a character that is used in Japanese for ""vs."" (as in, ""Alien vs. Predator"")."	This isn't plaid, it's tophat and sheaf. In the tophatted wheat cutting competition, one contestant gathered more sheafs than anyone else, he had an advantage<strong> vis-a-vis</strong> the rest because he had glued his tophat on, everyone else's hat kept coming off.	The word<strong> vis-a-vis</strong> is like <em>sentence glue</em>, it kind of joins sentences together.	<em>Wolverine</em> has to <em>glue</em> a <em>top hat</em> to his head when sitting<strong> vis-a-vis</strong> on a train so no one recognizes him.		
紋		family crest	Thread . . . plaid.		10	1863	1727	45	モン		Who knew that <em>Spiderman</em> was <em>Scottish!</em> He has sewn his<strong> family crest</strong> onto his uniform.	A<strong> family crest</strong> sown on to a garment with <em>thread</em> sometimes has a Latin <em>sentence</em> as a motto.	"If you look closely, you can see that on SPIDERMAN'S CREST, there is sown in his favorite SENTENCE, ""with great power, comes great responsibility.""."	"On <em>Spiderman's</em><strong> family crest</strong> reads the <em>sentence</em> ""With great power, comes great responsibility""… in Latin of course."	The scotsmen proudly display the <strong>family crest</strong> <em>threaded</em> into their <em>kilts</em>.		
蚊		mosquito	Insect . . . plaid.		10	1864	1728	45	ブン	か	The<strong> mosquito</strong> (an <em>insect</em>) knows only one <em>sentence</em>: Bzzzzz.	<strong>Mosquito</strong>es are the <em>insect</em> who love <em>Scots in plaid kilts</em> because it makes for easy access to the best parts.	How to tell a scottish<strong> mosquito</strong>? Easy. They are the <em>insects</em> with the <em>plaid kilts</em> on. (imagine a far side comic strip with a bunch of<strong> mosquito</strong>s at a house party).	Just when I thought there was no effective<strong> mosquito</strong> repellent, I found out they seem to really hate plaid sweaters!	The west coast of Scotland is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Unfortunately, there is one thing which can really 'bug' you while you're there - midges (like a small<strong> mosquito</strong>). Imagine them getting under a Scotsman's <em>tartan</em> kilt and having a feast.		
斑		speckled	Ball . . . plaid . . . ball.		12	1865	2556	45	ハン	ふ、まだら	Two kings, kilt: After an hour in the onsen, the two scottish <em>kings</em>, both heavily<strong> speckled</strong> like the scottish are wont to, decide to get out. However, in the mean time one of their <em>kilts</em> was stolen and only one was left.	"Wolverine was easily able to join the <a href=""../v4/1229.html"">squad</a> (#1229 班) when he was seen wearing a <em>top hat</em><strong> speckled</strong> with <em>jewels on the sides</em>.

He reached down and <strong>adjusted</strong> the <em>two things</em> between his skinny fencepost <em>legs</em>.	"This kanji means ""symmetry"" not ""adjusted."" STORY: The TWO FENCEPOSTS need to be SYMMETRICAL in size, otherwise you may smash your mouth into the lower side and start saying naughty SENTENCES."	You are trying to stretch a <em>plaid</em> between <em>two</em> <em>fenceposts</em>. It's not easy, as for all wrinkles to go away posts' positions must be carefully <strong>adjusted</strong>.	"HINT: this kanji as a primitive can mean <em>goalkeeper</em>. The ""fence posts"" are goalposts, and the two goalkeepers wear plaid uniforms (this kanji also means <strong>uniform</strong> as in even), making them uniform with each other and distinguishing them as goalkeepers from the rest of the team."	"[+dingomick] The <em>Scottish goalkeeper</em> has lost both of his legs and was forced to replace them with two bent <em>white picket fenceposts</em> nailed together with two boards, but that hasn't stopped him from playing his favorite sport: soccer. Imagine the camera zooming in on him after he makes a great play: ""Great save! Ah, there he is reaching under his <em>kilt</em> - he just<strong> adjusted</strong> his fencepost legs. There he goes again, oop, looks like he just<strong> adjusted</strong> something else as well!""."		
剤		dose	<i>Adjust</i> . . . <i>saber</i>. Think of this as a <b>dose</b> of medicine.		10	1867	1730	45	ザイ、スイ、セイ	かる、けず.る	When my medicine<strong> dose</strong> is way too large, I adjust it by cutting it into smaller pieces with my saber.	We had to <em>adjust</em> his<strong> dose</strong> slightly, after he went on a rampage with a <em>sabre</em>.	The <em>Scotsman goalkeeper</em> took a <strong>dose</strong> of medicine injected by <em>saber</em>, like a real man.	See my story for 1729. STORY: If you have one pill and you need to take an even<strong> DOSE</strong> of it twice a day, just cut it as SYMMETRICALLY as possible with your SABER.	The <em>Scotsman</em> in huge pain from a hangover demands his doctor adjust his pain killer <strong>dosage</strong> up and threatens him with a <em>saber</em>.		
済		finish	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>adjust</i>.

Subzero <em>adjusts</em> the <em>water</em> in your body and crushes you into a few million pieces.	After i've<strong> finish</strong>ed having a pee i adjust my trousers.	After you<strong> finish</strong> exercising, be sure to drink some water and adjust your pace (cool down and stretch).	"After the <em>Scotsman goalkeeper</em> gave someone a dose of poison [1730], someone from the opposing team engaged him in a match of Mortal Kombat. Uh oh, looks like the <em>Scotsman</em> lost - ""Finish Him!!!"" and as the <strong>finish</strong>ing punch is delivered, drops of <em>water</em> (ala SNES) come out, not blood…pretty disappointing."		
斎		purification	"<i>Plaid</i> . . . <i>fenceposts</i> . . . <i>altar</i>.

"An exorcism, or ""purification"" of the soul. The possessed girl is tied to two <strong>posts</strong> next to the <strong>altar</strong>, her head spinning around and around. Then the priest says the required <strong>sentence</strong>: ""The power of Christ compels you!""."	Kind of vulgar, but here the SCOTSMAN got tired of adjusting himself so decided try<strong> PURIFICATION</strong>. Sadly, he did it by straddling the ALTAR with his skinny LEGS.	The scottish priest in a <em>tartan</em> kilt is purifying his genitals. He's standing delicately atop two <em>fence posts</em>, and gingerly dipping himself atop the <em>altar</em>.	"[+fudo] The <em>Scotsman goalkeeper</em> is going all out to stop balls from crossing the goal line. Here he is in a <strong>purification</strong> ritual with a little mini <em>altar</em> on the goal line, throwing salt about and burning incense in order to <strong>purify</strong> the line. He prays: ""Oh dear Lord, let no balls pass this <strong>purified</strong> line of salt and chalk…"". He then <strong>purifies</strong> himself by rubbing the mini <em>altar</em> all over under his <em>kilt</em>. A shower would do, really…"		
粛		solemn	<i>Rake</i> . . . <i>rice</i> . . . <i>fenceposts</i>. Take special care to draw this character in the same order as the primitive. Note too, that the fourth stroke for <i>rice</i> is already taken care of by the fourth stroke of <i>rake</i>.		11	1870	1733	45	シュク、スク	つつし.む	Even though it's a maddening task, the monks stay <strong>solemn</strong> as they rake <em>rice</em> between the <em>fenceposts</em>.	<strong>Note:</strong> This is not <em>sieve</em> as it has a full <em>rice</em> and not <em>rice grains</em> and the hook is missing from <em>rake</em>. Also the given stroke order is incorrect (<em>fenceposts</em> should come last).	This is a zen rice garden. It is different from rock garden in only one aspect. Here you see <em>raked</em> white <em>rice</em> between the <em>fenceposts</em>. In<strong> solemn</strong> silence the monks rake rice every morning.	I tie CONDI RICE in between two FENCEPOSTS and prepare for the<strong> SOLEMN</strong> task ahead….beating her over the head with a RAKE.	The RICE thrown at the wedding must be RAKED up before the<strong> SOLEMN</strong> funeral procession enters between the FENCE POSTS.		
塁		bases	The kanji of this frame refers to the four <b>bases</b> that are placed at the corners of a baseball infield.

I learned this as enjoyable (which is 楽しい -　たのしい）<strong> Music</strong> is - 音楽 - おんがく as in sounds that are enjoyable.	The most <strong>enjoyable</strong> kind of <strong>music</strong> is when the conductor conducts with a <em>white sparkler</em> while standing in a <em>tree</em>.		
薬		medicine	Flowers . . . music.		16	1873	1736	45	ヤク	くすり	New-age<strong> medicine</strong> involves using things like <em>music</em> and <em>flowers</em> (aromatherapy) as treatment.	Oh man, this <strong>medicinal</strong> marijuana is making me hear MUSIC and see FLOWERS everywhere…	<em>Flowers</em> and <em>music</em> are the best<strong> medicine</strong> to make you happy.	You go to the 薬屋 to fill the prescription for your<strong> medicine</strong>, and upon opening the jar, a <em>flower</em> pops up and <em>music</em> starts playing.	<strong>Medicine</strong> commercials these days don't even tell you what the<strong> medicine</strong> does!

He's poking around the inside of his monitor with a magnesium <em>needle</em> when he causes a short circuit which sets his needle on fire making the needle look just like a <em>sparkler</em>.	It's quite <em>mysterious</em> how each <em>sparkler</em> gives of sparkles at a precise<strong> ratio</strong> of <em>ten</em> to one. Physicists have been studying this effect for decades, known as the Sparkler Effect, and using it to explain why stars look like sparklers in the night sky.	"A witches spell requires the proper<strong> RATIO</strong> of ingredients: ""TEN SPARKLERS and TEN COCOONS into the HAT ye load, wait TEN minutes and watch it explooooode! hehehehehe""."	When I first started downloading torrents, I thought that<strong> ratio</strong>s were very mysterious. Now I keep a <em>sparkling ten</em> to one<strong> ratio</strong>!

Youve got the st bernard dead centre in your sights (the box).	You must get the explosive into the <strong>center</strong>. The armor will protect him otherwise. The key is to wait for the <em>mouth</em> of the <em>St. Bernard</em> to be open, and then fling the dynamite into the <strong>center</strong> of it.	For the primitive, I'll try a <em>big</em> boxy <em>target</em> - like the kind you use to line up your enemy in a videogame before you blow it up. Here, though - you're given the opportunity to finally kill that <em>St Bernard</em> from <em>Duck Hunt</em> - just make sure to line it up in the <em>center</em> of your <em>target</em>…	"I see this as a modern-day pictogram for someone walking in carrying a big birthday cake, with one fat candle at its <strong>CENTRE</strong> (to remind me that the <strong>CENTRE</strong> vertical juts up from the ""cake""), and to be placed at the <strong>CENTRE</strong> of a table, in honor of the person who's the day's <strong>CENTRE</strong> of attention.

Imagine the<em> sun</em>, at the <em>center</em> of our solar system, like a huge disco-ball (a ball made with hundreds of tiny mirrors),<strong> reflect</strong>ing the light from the planets and stars around (instead of emitting light on its own). The kanji refers to images which are<strong> reflect</strong>ed, mirrored and also projected, as in the kanji compound 映画 (eiga) : a movie, film.

The two strokes of the <i>dagger</i> take the place of the middle stroke of <i>little</i>.	* As a primitive on the left, this kanji keeps the same form.

Those two dots we see are wolfies <em>animal legs</em> we see, by the way (a la smithsonian).	(I prefer to use <em>animal legs</em> instead of <em>little</em> so as not to resort to combining it with <em>dagger</em>:) The cow refused to leave the temple <em>grounds</em>, even when it was threatened with a <em>dagger</em>. Its <em>animal legs</em> just stayed planted firmly there so it could show its devotion to Buddha. This is the story of ''akabeko'', the<strong> red</strong> cow, a popular myth in the Aizu region of Japan.	This is a mass grave for <em>animal and human legs</em>. The serial killer is a Japanese guy with short legs and long-leg envy, so he cuts off legs that are longer than his and buries them here. Notice that since the legs have been cut off one-by-one and tossed in the grave randomly so the animal legs look a bit far apart and the human legs look a bit different than usual (direction of the curve of the right leg is opposite the usual). The <em>ground</em> is still<strong> RED</strong> with from all the blood spilled.	The <em>soil</em> was<strong> red</strong> after the hunter used his <em>dagger</em> to cut off the <em>animal's legs</em>.

In the<strong> Gulf</strong> war Iraq troops fight back with <em>water</em> guns, rotten <em>apples</em> and <em>bow</em> 'n' arrows - so much for the 'weapons of mass destruction' !	This is one beauty of a kanji! Looks like a painting of a sunset. You can see the sea (water), the coast shaped like a bow and the red sun (or some red apples trees planted nearby).

把		grasp	Fingers . . . mosaic.		7	1889	1752	45	ハ、ワ		Japanese censorship laws require pornos to use a <em>mosaic</em> screen, so you can't see what the porno chick is <strong>grasping</strong> with her <em>fingers</em> (but you can assume, neetch).

A man and woman are BOUND UP in a<strong> color</strong>ful sex act. She bends over, legs tucked underneath, exposing her FULL MOON buttocks in order to be penetrated. *Heisigian liberties aside, this is what the kanji literally means. By reporting this story, you are reporting Japanese to be a naughty language in general.	"This kanji has a secondary meaning relating to sex (so stop reading now if you have issues) and originally showed a bending person (<em>bound up</em>) over another bending person (<em>mosaic</em>).

Sometimes this process is slow, so you solve a RUBIK'S CUBE while you sit and wait.	If you're sick, a part of your body may produce<strong> fertilizer</strong> that makes a colorful mosaic.	Japanese porn producers apply a mosaic to the part of the body most frequently responsible for making<strong> fertilizer</strong> - too bad they neglect to mosaic the<strong> fertilizer</strong> itself! Sick, sick stuff.	This means <strong>manure</strong>, comma-shaped ( 巴 2096) output from a certain body part.	Natural<strong> fertilizer</strong> comes from a part of the body that cannot be shown on TV and therefore needs to be covered by mosaic.		
甘		sweet	This kanji is a pictograph of a small wicker basket. (The extra short stroke in the middle helps keep it distinct from the character for <i>twenty</i>.) All one needs to add is some image of <b>sweet</b> cakes or breads carried in the basket, and the union of picture and meaning is complete. Take care not to confuse with <i>confectionary</i> (Frame 1203).	* As a primitive, the pictograph's meaning of a <i>wicker basket</i> is used, a small one like the kind used for picnics.	5	1894	1757	46	カン	あま.い、あま.える、あま.やかす、うま.い	Little red riding hood is carrying around a wicker basket filled with<strong> sweet</strong> baked cookies for granny.

紺		navy blue	Thread . . . wicker basket.		11	1895	1758	46	コン		Thanks raulir - As many Japanese perverts know,<strong> navy blue</strong> threads conceal school girl sweetness underneath.	Much like Violet Beauregarde from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, <em>Spiderman</em> failed to heed <em>Willy Wonka</em>'s warnings, and upon chewing on the 3 course meal chewing gum turned a very navy shade of<strong> navy blue</strong>.	The sailor in the<strong> navy blue</strong> uniform grabbed the <em>lollipop</em> from the little girl, but luckily <em>Spiderman</em> swung in and saved it for her.	<em>Spiderman</em> bought his <em>sweet</em> a<strong> navy blue</strong> dress. Imagine Mary Jane walking down some stairs looking dazzling in it.	Girl in a school uniform made of<strong> navy blue</strong> threads carrying a wicker basket.		
某		so-and-so	The key word here refers to the adjective for an unspecified person or thing.

A generic person is described here as having body sort of like a tree trunk and head sort of like a wicker basket.	Two girls with a lollipop in a tree gossiping' so-and so did this.' 'really? so-and what did she do' ' o she is sooo wrong..'.	Lately I've been seeing a lot of<strong> so-and-so</strong> girls on the street. They have <em>sweet</em> faces, but their bodies look like <em>tree</em> trunks. It's like, damn bitch, if I had your potential, I'd lay off the donuts and hit the gym more often.	When <em>Willy Wonka</em> went into the jungle to search for the Oompaloompas, they at first believed him to be a malicious<strong> so-and-so</strong>, and so they chased him up a <em>tree</em>.	Tip : you can make<strong> so-and-so</strong> a person, which will help with the following kanji. Mr<strong> so-and-so</strong> has no defining features, i.e. no mouth, no eyes, just a grey blob.		
謀		conspire	Words . . . so-and-so.		16	1897	1760	46	ボウ、ム	はか.る、たばか.る、はかりごと	I imagine a clique of catty girls <strong>conspiring</strong> against a another girl…they are exchanging lots of <em>words</em>, chatting about how <em>so-and-so</em> girl is now up to such-and-such (gasp!), and how they will spread the word about it.	<em>Talking</em> about <em>so and so</em> behind their back.	"When you<strong> conspire</strong> against someone, you use the <em>word</em> ""<em>so-and-so</em>"" in case they or one of their friends are listening."	"You might hear the words of someone conspiring… ""If you do so-and-so…""."	Yes, it was indeed <em>Socrates</em> who<strong> conspire</strong>d with the Oompaloompas to send <em>Willy Wonka</em> up that <em>tree</em>.

In a divorce, the woman needs a<strong> mediator</strong> because she won't talk to that so-and-so.	The two little gossiping girls with their lollipops are having a fight. Now an adult woman (mom or teacher) has to come between them an serve as a<strong> mediator</strong>.	"Well the ""<em>so-and-so</em>""girl that was picked on in the previous frame tattled on the catty girls, and a catfight breaks out…at which point yet another <em>woman</em> was brought forth to be the<strong> mediator</strong> between their squabble. not like that would help things, but whatever…"	(inspired by akrodha, with basketman integrated in the story) Basketman is going through a divorce.

After 9-11, people sold<strong> national flag</strong>s by the bushel-basket. And for every <em>bushel-basket</em> you buy, you get a <em>free banner</em> with some cheesy patriotic quote.	A poor, agrarian nation features on its<strong> NATIONAL FLAG</strong> a BUSHEL BASKET.

One BUSHEL BASKET full of rice is enough to sustain a small family for a<strong> PERIOD</strong> of one MONTH.

The key word refers to the Japanese game played with black and white colored <i>stones</i> on a lined board.		13	1903	1766	46	ゴ		<strong>Go</strong> is <em>chess</em> played with <em>stones</em>.	The ignorant gaijin put a <em>rook</em> on top of his opponent's <em>stone</em> when playing<strong> Go</strong>, much to the consternation of the Japanese players.	The two<strong> Go</strong> masters, playing on a gigantic <em>stone</em><strong> Go</strong> board, take their <em>stone</em> playing chips from huge <em>barrels</em>.	<strong>Go</strong> needs a <em>bushel basket</em> full of <em>stone</em>s to play it.	I wanted to play <strong>Go</strong>, so I wanted to set up the board. I went for my <em>bushel basket</em>, where I keep all of the <em>stones</em>, but they fall out of the bottom! This is the same <em>bushel basket</em> that Charlie used in his escape! Now, I have nowhere to keep my <strong>Go</strong> stones. raulir 30-4-2006.		
基		fundamentals	Bushel basket . . . soil.		11	1904	1767	46	キ	もと、もとい	<strong>Fundamentals</strong> of <em>chess</em>: use the <em>rooks</em> to protect your <em>ground</em>.	A <em>Bushel-basket</em> full of <em>earth</em> contains the fundementals of farming. i.e. earth.	Before playing chess, you must learn the<strong> fundamentals</strong>: begin by placing a <em>rook</em> on the <em>ground</em>.	I took a course on the<strong> fundamentals</strong> of bushel basket-weaving. They teach you everything from the ground up. (sweetneet variation).	One doesn't become a grand master over night. Before he could graduate to using a real chess board, <em>Garry Kasparov</em> had to master the<strong> fundamentals</strong> of the game by drawing chess boards in a pile<em>dirt</em>. (a pile of <em>dirt</em> that he was for some reason straddling, I might add).		
甚		tremendously	<i>Bushel basket</i> . . . <i>equal</i>. Note how the first stroke of <i>equal</i> doubles up with the sixth stroke of the <i>bushel basket</i>, and how the <i>animal legs</i> of the <i>bushel basket</i> are dropped to make room for the <i>human legs</i> of <i>equal</i>.		9	1905	1768	46	ジン	はなは.だ、はなは.だしい	It's a tremendous match between the two chess-players. They are clearly eachother's equal.	These two <em>bushel baskets</em> are <strong>tremendously</strong> huge. But not only they are huge, they are also perfectly <em>equal</em> in size.	Losing both your <em>rooks</em> is <strong>tremendous</strong>. It's almost <em>equal</em> to having your queen's <em>legs</em> chopped from under her.	This kanji is<strong> tremendously</strong> difficult to remember because it is not <em>equal</em> to the other bushel baskets in this lesson. Their <em>bushel baskets</em> all have animal legs.	Equal I remember as the counter for small animals. Remember Battle Chess? I just picture a tremendous <strong>rook</strong> from Battle Chess wandering around stomping on <strong>little animals</strong>. Those guys were sweet.		
勘		intuition	Tremendously . . . muscle.		11	1906	1769	46	カン		<strong>Intuition</strong> is a <em>tremendously</em> <em>power</em>ful resource of the mind.	"Using Zareon's story for the previous frame ""tremendously""… The two chessplayers who are eachother's equals are so good at chess that they don't have to even move a muscle. Their brain power does it for them. Furthermore, they don't even have to think, really. Their<strong> intuition</strong> takes control. This is: extreme chess."	A woman's<strong> intuition</strong> is TREMENDOUSLY POWERful.	I had an<strong> intuition</strong> of who would win this fight by judging the size of my opponents <em>tremendously</em> large <em>muscles</em>.	<strong>Intuition</strong>–<em>tremendously powerful</em>.		
堪		withstand	Soil . . . tremendously.		12	1907	1770	46	カン、タン	た.える、たま.る、こ.らえる、こた.える	Because I hid myself behind a huge <em>dirt</em> barrier I dug, I was able to<strong> withstand</strong> the <em>tremendous</em> nuclear blast.	Plain old <em>soil</em> can <strong>withstand</strong> <em>tremendous</em> amounts of pressure.	The two equal chessplayers from the last two frames are duking it out still. Part of this extreme chess match is when the judges dump a huge mound of soil onto them. Watch as they<strong> withstand</strong> the weight of the dirt and how their brainpower keeps all the chess pieces, rooks and all, on the board. Simply astounding.	The Japanese high-rise was built to<strong> WITHSTAND</strong> <em>GROUND</em> tremors of <em>TREMENDOUS</em> force!	Though I had lost both rooks in chess, a <em>tremendous</em> loss, I was able to hold my <em>ground</em> on the chessboard and<strong> withstand</strong> my opponent's attacks.

遺		bequeath	Precious . . . road.		15	1909	1772	46	イ、ユイ	のこ.す	"Bilbo<strong> bequeath</strong>es the ""PRECIOUS"" to Frodo, who will carry it on the long ROAD to Mordor."	"""<strong>Bequeath</strong>"" is an odd old word, isn't it? Basically, it just deals with how I want my <em>precious</em> possessions dealt out, after I die, later down the <em>road</em>.

"I'm crossing the road with my <strong>precious</strong> items and suddenly a huge Mac truck springs out of the fog.

If sometime down the <em>road</em> I happen to die, I<strong> bequeath</strong> you everything <em>precious</em> I have.	When you're at the end of your ROAD, you<strong> BEQUEATH</strong> what is PRECIOUS to you.		
遣		dispatch	This kanji takes away the <i>maestro</i>'s baton and replaces it with a <i>purse</i>. The <i>road</i> represents his being <b>dispatched</b> on his way a san obvious misfit. You will remember that when he did have his baton, he was being <i>chased</i> down the road by his fans. All of which shows what a difference a single stroke can make!		13	1910	1773	46	ケン	つか.う、-つか.い、-づか.い、つか.わす、や.る	<strong>Dispatch</strong> all cars and <em>chase</em> the <em>maestro</em>!

He's thrown away his baton and stolen the <em>purse</em> of some lady on the <em>road</em>! 派遣 (はけん):<strong> dispatch</strong>, send 人材派遣会社 (じんざいはけんがいしゃ): temporary staff service (temp agency) 遣わす (つかわす): to send,<strong> dispatch</strong> 小遣い (こづかい): allowance, pocket money 気遣う (きづかう): be concerned about, care about, worry about.	To remember this one, I combine the <em>purse</em> with the key part of <em>bureaucrat</em> to come up with <em>diplomatic pouch</em>, the thing that is used to hold a<strong> dispatch</strong> whenever an emissary is<strong> dispatch</strong>ed on the <em>road.</em>.	<em>Bond</em> has stolen a lady spy's <em>purse</em> while she was asleep after their evening together.

無		nothingness	This character is the Japanese character for the supreme philosophical principle of much Oriental thought: <b>nothingness</b>. Make use of the oaken <i>tub</i> from the previous frame, and add to that the <i>oven fire</i> at the bottom.		12	1913	1775	46	ム、ブ	な.い	When I enter the <em>wooden tub</em> heated by <em>flames</em> in the onsen, I can let all my worries slip away and be submerged into<strong> nothingness</strong>.

As the <em>heat/flames</em> rises up through the <em>oaken tub</em> for a long period of time, all the water evaporates and what's left is<strong> nothingness</strong>.	In the ancient days of Buddhism, philosphers were common. Each of them would deeply ponder the meaning of <strong>nothingness</strong> while <em>reclining</em> in their <em>oaken tubs</em> of hot water. Underneath, there were <em>flames</em> to keep the water from cooling, tended by the non-philosophers. Immacolata 8-5-2006. Nothing too good for pondering the meaning of <strong>nothingness</strong>!

粗		coarse	Rice . . . shelf.		11	1915	1777	47	ソ	あら.い、あら-	Refined rice [1535] can only be found in exclusive grocery shops.<strong> Coarse</strong> <em>rice</em> by contrast fills the supermarket <em>shelves</em> - don't go looking for anything else there.	Ugh, why does this <em>shelf</em> feel so<strong> coarse</strong>? Because it's made of <em>rice</em>, of<strong> coarse</strong>! Get it? Of<strong> coarse</strong>?? Hahahahahahahahahah god i hate my life.	In America they sell<strong> coarse</strong> rice on the shelves. The Japanese are much more discriminating, as they eat rice all the time, so they want finer rice.	Japanese carpenters don't use sandpaper, they use rice-paper(rice glued on to some paper). Here the carpenter is using the<strong> coarse</strong> paper to smooth out the shelf he's making.	"""<em>RICE</em> is not nice,"" said the <em>CAT IN THE HAT</em>, ""it is much to<strong> COARSE</strong>, like food for a horse.""."		
租		tariff	Wheat . . . shelf.		10	1916	1778	47	ソ		The EU and US impose such high<strong> tariff</strong>s on food imports that third world <em>wheat</em> (the most basic of staples) never reaches first world supermarket <em>shelves</em>.	According to Henshall, this kanji originally represented the harvested rice (the wheat primitive) that farmers paid as a tithe. Its meaning today would seem to be very similar. Imagine the farmer putting aside some of his harvested <em>wheat</em> on a <em>shelf</em> in order to pay the<strong> tariff</strong> to his lord.	All the <em>wheat</em> imports sit on a <em>shelf</em> until the <strong>tariff</strong> is paid and it can be distributed.	Tax. (Heisig is trying to hard to come up with different words) The devil who has collected wheat taxes before, stores these taxes in shelves.	"""If <em>WHEAT</em> you'd like to eat,"" said the <em>CAT IN THE HAT</em>, ""then you'll have to pay the sheriff a<strong> TARIFF</strong>.""."

I think the <em>dogs</em> purposely<strong> aim at</strong> your <em>shelves</em> to deal the most damage.	Like a <em>pack of wild dogs</em>, my children<strong> aim at</strong> the top of my <em>bookshelf</em> where I hide my porn.	There's this game at the carnival where you<strong> aim at</strong> prizes on a <em>shelf</em>. In this particular variant, you<strong> aim at</strong> pictures of <em>wild dogs</em> on a <em>shelf</em>. The more you knock down, the better the prize!

祖		ancestor	Altar . . . shelf.		9	1918	1779	47	ソ		The<strong> ancestor</strong> worship is so common in Daoist and buddhist countries that you can buy tiny altars to put on the shelves, one for each deceased family member.	The urns of <strong>ancestors</strong> are kept on <em>shelves</em> next to the <em>altar</em>.	At the partents of my wife's house (she is Japanese) they have a shelf with pictures of their<strong> ancestor</strong>s. Its like a little shrine and they often pray to it.	An altar on the shelf to remember your<strong> ancestor</strong>s.	<strong>Ancestor</strong>s are revered in Japan. Some homes have large family <em>altar</em>s ( 仏壇 (ぶつだん)) with several <em>shelves</em> to accommodate the name plaques (and these days photographs) of all the<strong> ancestor</strong>s. 祖母 (そぼ): grandmother 祖父 (そふ): grandfather 祖国 (そこく): motherland, fatherland, native country 先祖 (せんぞ):<strong> ancestor</strong> 祖先 (そせん):<strong> ancestor</strong> [also used in a broader sense, such as apes were the<strong> ancestor</strong>s of humans].		
阻		thwart	Pinnacle . . . shelf.		8	1919	1780	47	ソ	はば.む	In a last ditch effort to <strong>thwart</strong> the invaders of <em>The Pinnacle</em>, they push glass <em>shelves</em> over the edge onto their heads below.	The shortness of the Japanese<strong> thwart</strong>s their attempts to reach the topmost (pinnacle) shelf without grabbing a chair.	<em>The Pinnacle</em> keeps its pantry <em>shelves</em> locked at nighttime, to<strong> thwart</strong> midnight snackers. No fatties allowed here!	Keeping porn on the <em>pinnacle</em> of a <em>bookshelf</em> can<strong> thwart</strong> snooping kids (thanks bodhisamaya).	To<strong> thwart</strong> attacks on the Pinnacle, their shelves are always full of various magical weapons.		
査		investigate	Tree . . . shelf.		9	1920	1781	47	サ		A whole team of cops is sent to <strong>investigate</strong> how a <em>tree</em> could grow on top of a <em>shelf</em> with no soil or water.	The result of the inverstigation of the missing <em>Trees</em>? Why, most of them had become <em>shelfs</em>!	"Police suspected that some <em>wooden shelves</em> had come from illigaly lumbered timber in the Amazon. They launched an investigation in to the matter. ""Trees are more important than shelves and therefore should be placed on top"" A spokesman for the police said in an interview."	Why the hell would a <em>tree</em> be growing on a <em>shelf</em>? Time to<strong> investigate</strong>. Also time to think up a story that makes more damn sense.	"I have a little potted <em>tree</em> sitting on my <em>shelf</em>, and I found a note in it that said ""You will die in 3 days."" So, naturally I try to figure out who put it there! Dave Chappelle did a comedy special way back (1997) where he does an impression of a white guy in a horror movie with just one line, 'I'd better<strong> investigate</strong>!' That would be me in this situation."		
助		help	<i>Shelf</i> . . . <i>power</i>. The reason why the <i>shelf</i> appears on the left here is that the right side is the normal position for power, the stronger primitive. Indeed, the only exception in all the kanji is the character for <i>add</i> (Frame 932).		7	1921	1782	47	ジョ	たす.ける、たす.かる、す.ける、すけ	<strong>HELP</strong>! Someone's pinned under this bookshelf and it's gonna take a lot of muscle to lift it off!	Can you <strong>help</strong> me move this <em>shelf</em>? I don't have the <em>muscle</em> to do it alone.	To assemble an <em>IKEA shelf</em>, logic is sometimes not enough. You need <strong>help</strong> from someone with brute <em>muscle</em> strength!	Anna doesn't have the <em>power</em> to reach the merchandise on the top <em>shelf</em>, so she asks a passerby - any old <em>Jo</em> (じょ) - to<strong> help</strong> her.	"While it's always the heroine that discovers the <em>hidden passageway behind the shelves</em>, they never have enough <em>muscle</em> power to open it on their own and they have to call for ""<strong>Help</strong>!""…"		
宜		best regards	This kanji, a polite way of expressing one's <b>best regards</b> to another. Its elements: <i>house</i> . . . <i>shelf</i>.		8	1922	1783	47	ギ	よろ.しい、よろ.しく	It seems like every time my Japanese friends send me their<strong> best regards</strong>, they accompany them with a gift. Over time, I've gotten so many that I had to buy a <em>second house</em> which contains nothing but <em>several fancy shelves</em>. Each shelf is dedicated to a certain friend of mine and contains every last one of their presents.	"Noone in japan will admit to this but every house has a secret ""best regards shelf"" hidden away somewhere.

畳		tatami mat	Rice field . . . crown . . . shelf.		12	1923	1784	47	ジョウ、チョウ	たた.む、たたみ、かさ.なる	The king is peacefully sleeping on his new<strong> tatami mat</strong> when all of a sudden a shelf falls over and kills him. You can see his crown poking out and the brains splatter out the top of his head from all the pressure.	Making <strong>tatami mats</strong> from <em>rice field</em> waste was Japan's <em>crowning</em> achievement, but for some reason other countries just <em>shelved</em> the idea.	Rice Field + Crown + Shelf:<strong> Tatami mat</strong>s were used by everyone - from the workers in the <em>Rice fields</em> to the <em>crown</em> - and when they were not in used, they were put on the <em>shelf</em>.	To rest on the<strong> tatami mat</strong>, he puts his BRAIN and CROWN on the SHELF. Dont forget to put it on again, when you leave!	After a hard days work in the <em>rice field</em>, the humble king hung his <em>crown</em> upon his <em>shelf</em>, curled up on his<strong> tatami mat</strong>, and slept.		
並		row	This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for <i>stand up</i>. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.	* The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it. ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line. We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to <i>upside down in a row</i>.	8	1924	1785	47	ヘイ、ホウ	な.み、なら.べる、なら.ぶ、なら.びに	This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of <em>two</em> people <em>standing</em> in a<strong> row</strong>.	"Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a<strong> row</strong>ing boat. In a<strong> row</strong>ing boat people sit in<strong> row</strong>s, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for ""rowboat"" coming at frame 1876. The<strong> row</strong>ing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for ""rowboat"" has a generic meaning of ""a small boat"". In any case, the kanji for ""rowboat"" will not appear as a primitive in the book."	Roman numeral II with 2<strong> row</strong>s of animal horns.	<strong>Full form:</strong> The image of a <em>viking longboat</em> has the advantage of being both a pictograph and lending to the idea of <em>rowing</em>. <strong>Flattened form:</strong> Here, we simply take the action of <em>rowing</em>, already reinforced by the previous image. <strong>Upside-down-in-a-row form:</strong> The horns on the top of this form follows the other forms as an image of a <em>Viking Berserker</em> with his horned helmet.	"Pictograph of the standing<strong> row</strong> in a theatre. // Primitive: a<strong> row</strong> of standing penguins (since they can't sit). If it's in the top position, the penguins are in a<strong> row</strong> in a balcony above the stage. If it's in the bottom position, the penguins are in the front<strong> row</strong>, lower than the stage. If the top 3 strokes are moved to the bottom (""upside down in a<strong> row</strong>""), then the penguins are in a<strong> row</strong> doing headstands."		
普		universal	Row . . . sun.		12	1925	1786	47	フ	あまね.く、あまねし	People at<strong> Universal</strong> Studios wait in rows so long that the sun goes down.	"To me, <em>row</em> is way too close to <a href=""../v4/812.html"">file</a> (#812 列), so I'm adopting Fab's meaning of <em>rowboat</em> from the previous frame.<strong> Universal</strong> Studios went through a number of logo animations before settling on the one they are most famous for: the letters<strong> UNIVERSAL</strong> orbiting the Earth. One of the most ridiculous of these involved a man <em>rowing</em> himself in a boat around the <em>sun</em>."	It is a <strong>universal</strong> human desire to sit in <em>rows</em> to watch the <em>sun</em> go down.	If every planet lined up in a row with the sun there would be a<strong> universal</strong> solar eclipse.	"A song<strong> universal</strong>ly known among the kinder, at least in the English-speaking world, is ""<em>Row, Row, Row</em> Your Boat"" - sung by a row of schoolchildren, <em>tongues wagging in the mouth</em> as in <a href=""../v4/21.html"">chant</a> (#21 唱)."

A <strong>musical score</strong> can be read, but not like <em>ordinary words</em>. Music is a <em>universal language</em>.	<strong>MUSICAL SCORE</strong>S are not written in WORDS, but in a UNIVERSAL language called notes.	Small addition to Raichu's story:<strong> Musical score</strong>s are in a <em>universal</em> language.

湿		damp	Water . . . sun . . . row.		12	1927	1788	47	シツ、シュウ	しめ.る、しめ.す、うるお.う、うるお.す	You first wash you clothes with <em>water</em> and wring them until they are just<strong> damp</strong> before hanging them in a <em>row</em> under the <em>sun</em> to dry. If you don't wring them<strong> damp</strong> first they will take days to dry!	When your things are<strong> damp</strong>, you line them up in a row under the sun.	An image: a shirt hangs on the oars of an old <em>rowboat</em>. Though it is slowly being dried by the <em>sun</em> high above, the occasional <em>drops of water</em> from it indicate that it is still<strong> damp</strong>.	I'll bet most of us have had this experience at a water park… You are gazing at the <em>water</em> hungrily while standing under the hot <em>sun</em>, waiting in a long <em>row</em> to get on the water slide. By the time it's your turn, you've been under the sun so long that you're not even all that wet anymore - just a little bit<strong> damp</strong>.	The <em>row</em> of penguins find themselves in the front row, right under the <em>sun</em>. It's very hot, so they spray themselves with cool <em>water</em>. This of course makes the entire theatre very<strong> damp</strong>!

At the time of Thanksgiving, there's a row of all sorts of food on the table, which you mustn't eat if you want to stay as<strong> slender</strong> as a thread.	<em>Spiderman</em> is watching his weight and trying to become<strong> slender</strong>, so instead of eating a whole turkey for <em>Thanksgiving</em>, he decides to only eat a <em>penguin</em>.	<em>Spiderman</em> has to stay<strong> slender</strong>, so during <em>thanksgiving</em>, he keeps away and <em>rows a rowboat</em>. (Zarxrax).	During <em>Thanksgiving</em> dinner, Spiderman is exercising on the <em>rowing machine</em>. He says he has to<strong> slender</strong> up so that he looks better in his Spidey-suit for Mary Jane.		
霊		spirits	"<i>Rain</i> . . . <i>two</i> . . . <i>row</i>. This character will refer only to the inhabitants of the ""<b>spirit</b> world,"" and not to moods or temperaments, for which we will learn another character in frame 2030."		15	1930	1791	47	レイ、リョウ	たま	After <em>raining</em> for <em>two</em> days in a <em>row</em>, you plead with the <strong>SPIRITS</strong> for some relief. (Adapted from johnskb,21-5-2006).	When it <em>rains</em>, <em>two</em> worlds come together and <strong>spirits</strong> can be seen in the forest, dancing in a <em>row</em>.	When it <em>rains</em>, the <strong>spirits</strong> have to cross between the <em>two</em> worlds in a <em>rowboat</em>.	Under a rainy sky Two <em>rows</em> of<strong> spirits</strong> wait one for heaven and one for hell.	After praying to the<strong> spirits</strong> for <em>two</em> days <em>in a row</em>, it finally <em>rained</em>. See! The <em>rain</em><strong> spirits</strong> really do exist!		
業		profession	In a row upside down . . . not yet.		13	1931	1792	47	ギョウ、ゴウ	わざ	A truly gruesome<strong> profession</strong>: an abattoir worker. Where the carcasses are <em>upside down in a row</em> that have <em>not yet</em> been cut up into sausages and steaks.	"My<strong> profession</strong> is taking unfinished rowboats and waterproofing them. Customers come in all the time asking if I've finished, and I point to their <em>upside-down rowboat</em>, still wet with sealant, and say, ""<em>not yet</em>""."	The oldest<strong> profession</strong>: prostitution. I was once in a brothel in Amsterdam where the working girls had a group of businessmen blindfolded and hanging <em>upside down in a row</em>, <em>not yet</em> spanked and whipped, but waiting eagerly.	My life is ruined. All my <strong>business</strong>es went <em>upside down in a row</em>. I'm <em>not yet</em> ready to change<strong> profession</strong>s though.	Taking this <em>upside down in a row</em> world and placing it upright is a<strong> profession</strong> that this world is <em>not yet</em> ready for.		
撲		slap	Fingers . . . upside down in a row . . . husbands.		15	1932	1793	47	ボク		After a row husbands take their wives upsides down over the knee and<strong> slap</strong> them with their fingers on the bottom (if that doesn't get me banned…).	Here we have badly behaving HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. Each wife approaches her HUSBAND, berates him, gives him a sharp<strong> SLAP</strong> in the face and, Three-Stooges style, pokes him in the eyes with her FINGERS.	A couple in a rowboat. The wife<strong> slap</strong>s the <em>husband</em> so hard with her <em>fingers</em> that the entire <em>boat</em> flips <em>upside-down</em>.	I'm the <em>husband</em>. I told my wife to lay <em>upside down</em> so I could have an easier time <em>fingering</em> her. Needless to say, I got a<strong> slap</strong> in the face.	"The wife immediately regretted giving her <em>Berserker husband</em> the <em>finger</em> after he <strong>slapped</strong> her half way across the room. See <a href=""../v4/1785.html"">row</a> (#1785 並)."		
僕		me	"This key word is yet another synonym for ""I,"" somewhat more familiar in tone. As a rule, it is a word that boys and men use to refer to themselves. Its elements: <i>person</i> . . . <i>husbands</i> . . . <i>in a row upside down</i>."		14	1933	1794	47	ボク	しもべ	"Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig<strong> me</strong>thod, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it's the kanji for ""boku."" Males usually use either ""boku"" or ""ore"" (instead of ""watashi"") to refer themselves. ""Boku"" is slightly boyish and soft; ""ore"" is rough & tough. Mr. T would definitely use ""ore"" – but when he's one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to ""boku"" when he pleads ""come on baby, it's<strong> ME</strong>!""."	Mr. T also finds himself as one of the HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. But when his wife comes up to punish him, he pleads, “It’s<strong> ME</strong>, Baby. I wasn’t behaving badly like these other foo’s.”.	<strong>Me</strong> awaken to discover<strong> me</strong>self upside down over Mr. T's knee getting slapped. Does this make Mr. T<strong> me</strong> husband??	"<em>Row of upside down husbands</em> all begging <em>Mr T</em> to set them free…""<strong>ME</strong>!<strong> ME</strong><strong> ME</strong>!""."	"<em>Mr T.</em> watches the <em>rowboat-overturning</em> <a href=""../v4/1793.html"">slap</a> (#1793 撲) from the shore and says, ""I'm sure glad that ain't<strong> me</strong>""."		
共		together	<i>Salad</i> . . . <i>animal legs</i>.	* The primitive retains the meaning of <i>together</i>. Imagine things <i>strung together</i> like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with <i>bushel basket</i>, this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure.	6	1934	1795	47	キョウ	とも、とも.に、-ども	"The character for <a href=""../v4/1799.html"">deluge</a> (#1799 洪) gave me the idea to use<strong> together</strong> as a primitive for <em>Noah's Ark</em>. Noah kept plenty of <em>salad</em> on board to entice the animals with their <em>animal legs</em> to scurry on board<strong> together</strong>, two by two."	The conjoined twins, who are always<strong> together</strong>, have trouble eating<strong> together</strong> because one is a vegetarian, eating <em>salad</em> and the other is a avid meat eater, eating <em>chicken legs</em>.[Thanks fuaburisu!].	Imagine yakitori with <em>animal legs</em> and <em>salad</em> skewered on<strong> together</strong>.	"<em>Salad</em> and <em>animal legs</em> just go<strong> together</strong>. This primitive means <em>chicken caesar salad</em>. <a href=""http://www.kfc.com/menu/salads.asp"">http://www.kfc.com/menu/salads.asp</a>."	"After I put animal legs in my vegetarian girlfriend's salad as a joke, she said, ""We can't be<strong> together</strong> anymore.""."		
供		submit	<b>Submit</b> here is a transitive verb, meaning to offer or present. Its elements: <i>person</i> . . . <i>strung together</i>.		8	1935	1796	47	キョウ、ク、クウ、グ	そな.える、とも、-ども	"It took over 600 frames for <em>Mr T</em> to <a href=""../v4/1142.html"">make</a> (#1142 作), the <em>Ark</em>, but when he was finally done, he cast his saw aside and<strong> submit</strong>ted the <em>Ark</em> to Noah for his approval. ""I pity the foo who doesn't climb aboard this ark,"" said Noah to his friend."	"<em>Mr. T</em> <strong>submits</strong> a resume <em>together</em> with his application. ""I pity da foo don't got no resume!"" he says."	When <em>people</em> are <em>together</em> and form a group, they suddenly<strong> submit</strong> their personal responsibility to the mob mentality.	Mr. T (<em>person</em>)<strong> submit</strong>s to the police all <em>strung together</em> the criminals that he has captured.	<em>Person</em> + <em>Together</em>: You have to be <em>together</em> with another <em>person</em> when you<strong> submit</strong> a request to get into the ark.

異		uncommon	Brains . . . together.		11	1936	1797	47	イ	こと、こと.なる、け	Noah's Ark is so<strong> uncommon</strong>ly large, he can even fit a rice field on top to feed the animals.	_potentially offensive (sorry): It's<strong> uncommon</strong> to find someone with <em>brains</em> who also believes in the story of Noah's <em>Ark</em>.	<em>Brains</em> <em>together</em> with beauty is an <strong>uncommon</strong> combination.	It's<strong> uncommon</strong> to find a pair of <em>together twins</em> who are connected at the brain! When such a set does turn up, they are inevitably showcased on TV.	Finding <em>brains</em> in a <em>chicken caesar salad</em> is<strong> uncommon</strong>, unless you eat at McDonald's.		
翼		wing	Feathers . . . uncommon.		17	1937	1798	47	ヨク	つばさ	The thing about feathers is that they usually cover the entire bird. A creature with <em>feathers</em> only on its <strong>wings</strong> would be very <em>uncommon</em>.	<strong>WING</strong>S without any FEATHERS would be an UNCOMMON site. Well, unless you like to eat chicken<strong> WING</strong>S alot.	This is つばさ. To make a distinct image you can think about aircraft<strong> wing</strong> for which this kanji is also used. <em>Feathers</em> would be extremely <em>uncommon</em> to use in design of an aircraft<strong> wing</strong>s.	When we talk about<strong> wing</strong>s and <strong>feathers</strong> we usually talk about 羽 , but the more <strong>uncommon</strong> form is つばさ for larger<strong> wing</strong>s- like angels - quite <strong>uncommon</strong> beings.	Reki's <strong>wing</strong> <em>feathers</em> were an <em>uncommon</em> color among haibane–they were black instead of white.		
戴		accept humbly	Thanksgiving . . . uncommon.		17	1938	2702	47	タイ	いただ.く	At <em>Thanksgiving</em>, it’s <em>uncommon</em> for people to<strong> accept humbly</strong> the food: most people just dig in.	You're invited to a <em>Thanksgiving</em> party in Japan! Awesome! You're so happy that your Japanese friends are trying to make you feel at home (you've been homesick recently). You sit down to the table, and they bring out some..uh…<em>uncommon</em> food. Really <em>uncommon</em>. Like just imagine the most <em>uncommon</em> <em>Thanksgiving</em> food ever, and that's what you're given (i don't know, a frisbee or something?). Of course, you have to be Japanese and<strong> accept humbly</strong> their food.	As THANKSGIVING is an American holiday, it is UNCOMMON to say いただきます! before eating.	"""<strong>ACCEPT HUMBLY</strong>"" is a translation for 頂戴する (chōdai-suru), a Japanese expression of <em>THANKS-GIVING</em> that shows an <em>UNCOMMON</em> degree of respect and formality, and is reserved for the most <em>UNCOMMONl</em>y solemn occasions. Ironically, 戴 also appears in 戴きます (いただきます), which is also a form of <em>THANKS-GIVING</em>, but is <em>anything but UNCOMMON</em>. In fact, it is so commonplace to that it borders on formulaic and meaningless. (NB: いただきます is also written 頂きます )."	"During <em>Thanksgiving</em> it is <em>uncommon</em> to see Americans<strong> accept humbly</strong> their meal. Usually they're more like ""Turkeyyy!!! Give me my turkeeeey, bitch!""."		
洪		deluge	Water . . . strung together.		9	1939	1799	47	コウ		<em>Water</em> plus <em>Noah's Ark</em> equals<strong> deluge</strong>.	Lots of water coming together is called a<strong> deluge</strong>.	Even as the <em>water</em> was rising, somehow Noah got <em>together</em> all the right animals before the<strong> deluge</strong> began in earnest.	I downed my <em>chicken caesar salad</em> with a<strong> deluge</strong> of <em>water</em>, and it was delugious!	The<strong> deluge</strong> of <em>water</em> was expected, and all were safe <em>together</em> aboard <em>Noah's Ark</em>.		
港		harbor	Deluge . . . snakes.		12	1940	1800	47	コウ	みなと	During a <em>deluge</em>, all the poor <em>snakes</em> get washed into the <strong>harbour</strong>.	All throughout the <em>deluge</em> Noah had been kicking himself for forgetting to bring any <em>snakes</em> onto the <em>Ark</em>. It wasn't until the <em>deluge</em> had finished, and Noah had brought the <em>Ark</em> safely back to the <strong>harbour</strong> that he realised that the <em>snakes</em> had been under the <em>Ark</em> all along.	"<strong>The Office of Film and Literature Classification advises that this story is rated M due to moderate horror violence, moderate coarse language, sex scene and incidental drug use.</strong> ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking <em>snakes</em> on this motherfucking <em>Ark</em>! Get it to the <strong>harbour</strong> now!"" (thanks rgravina and uragi)."	"<strong>While edited for consistency and more family oriented viewing, the Office of Film and Literature Classification still advises that this story is rated M due to moderate horror violence, moderate coarse language, sex scene and incidental drug use.</strong> After weeks of <em>water</em> getting in and <em>snakes</em> sliding under his feet, Noah proclaimed ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherf•••ing <em>snakes</em> on this motherf•••ing <em>Ark</em>! Get it to the <strong>harbour</strong> now!"" (thanks cangy rgravina and uragi)."	When the cargo ship from Africa unloaded it's cargo onto the<strong> harbor</strong>, a <em>deluge</em> of <em>snakes</em> came pouring out of the cargo hold.		
暴		outburst	Sun . . . strung together . . . rice grains.		15	1941	1801	47	ボウ、バク	あば.く、あば.れる	"Having spent all <em>day</em> <em>stringing together</em> <em>grains of rice</em> he suddenly had an<strong> outburst</strong>, ""I can take it any longer!""."	Noah was having an<strong> outburst</strong> after being at sea for 40 days and 40 nights and running out of rice grains to eat. Then the <em>sun</em> suddenly burst out in an<strong> outburst</strong> over the <em>Ark</em> and there was an<strong> outburst</strong> of cheering.	Hint: Popcorn.	Another freakin' <em>day</em> on this freakin' <em>Ark</em>, all there is to eat is freakin' <em>rice</em>! Aaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrggh! …………His time on the Ark seemed to be getting to Noah (the hot sun overhead didn't help).	"One day on Noah's Ark, Noah's eldest son throws down his chopsticks and has this<strong> outburst</strong>: ""That's it! I've had it! The sun is out, why are we still out on this damn Ark together eating the same damn rice??"" That was the day Noah sent the dove out. (Thanks bodhisamaya)."		
爆		bomb	Fire . . . outburst.		19	1942	1802	47	バク	は.ぜる	Actually means explosion, like an outburst of fire.	<strong>Bomb</strong>s make fiery outbursts. It's almost too logical, this one.	"An <em>outburst</em> of <em>fire</em> explodes outside Noah's Ark. ""What happen!?"", Noah shouted. ""Somebody set up us the<strong> bomb</strong>!"", came the Lord's reply."	"I laughed out loud so hard at Shibo's comment. Amazing. If you don't know what he's talking about go here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVsijmCFs50"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVsijmCFs50</a>."	<strong>Bomb</strong>s=a <em>fire</em> <em>outburst</em>.		
恭		respect	Strung together . . . valentine.		10	1943	1803	47	キョウ	うやうや.しい	Noah feels like he gets no<strong> respect</strong> from the other passengers on the Ark, but they all make him Valentine's Day cards to show how much they<strong> respect</strong> what he's done for them.	If you wanna stay <em>together</em> you have to show your <em>valentine</em><strong> respect</strong>.	"As I like Aretha Franklin's song ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"", I cut out each of the letters from pieces of card, then <em>string</em> them all <em>together</em> and send it to her as a <em>valentine</em>."	If you<strong> respect</strong> your girlfriend you will definitely spend Valentine's day together.	As a sign of<strong> respect</strong> for all those who did not make it onto the <em>Ark</em>, Noah hung <em>valentines</em> on the underside of the <em>Ark</em>.		
選		elect	Two snakes . . . strung together . . . road.		15	1944	1804	47	セン	えら.ぶ	There were so many <em>snakes</em> on the <em>road</em> to <em>Noah's ark</em> so they had to<strong> elect</strong> which two would represent the <em>snake</em> species.	You're driving on the road and you see two snakes together. You can't avoid both, so you have to<strong> elect</strong> which one gets run over.	Isn't this how the US presedential<strong> elect</strong>ion works? You are given a choice between <em>two snakes</em>. Their politics are actually <em>strung together</em> but you get to feel as though you chose which one you want to lead you down the political <em>road</em> for the next four years. So which <em>snake</em> are you going to<strong> elect</strong>?	There isn't quite enough room on <em>Noah's Ark</em> for all the animals. So they decide to<strong> elect</strong> which two animals to kick out on to the <em>road</em>. Suprise, Suprise, they chose to get rid of the <em>two snakes</em>.	Who am I going to<strong> elect</strong>, both the candidates are <em>two snakes</em> who <em>together</em> both promise a <em>road</em> to better government, you know what I think I'll stay home on<strong> elect</strong>ion day.		
殿		Mr.	Flags . . . strung together . . . missile.		13	1945	1805	47	デン、テン	との、-どの	<strong>Mr.</strong> President! We all stand here <em>together</em> under a national <em>flag</em>. One thing is certain: we'll never give in. We are launching nuclear <em>missiles</em> now to implement mutually assured destruction protocol.	(+synewave) Noah looks on in disbelief as<strong> Mr.</strong> and Mrs. Smith board the <em>Ark</em>, start waving their <em>flag</em> everywhere and blasting everything in sight with a <em>missile launcher</em>.	<strong>Mr.</strong> Bush is has sullied the reputation of the US <em>flag</em>, this tragedy <em>together</em> with the countless <em>missiles</em> that have killed innocent people have sent the worlds opinion of America the lowest it has ever been.	"Only in Hollywood. The new NOAH's ARK movie had the FLAG raised over the ARK signifying it's about to leave. Crowds come to board but Noah aims MISSILES at them to hold them away. His catch phrase ""They Call me MISTER Noah!!!"" Well, better than Evan Almighty I guess."	This is the <strong>Mr.</strong> (との) used when addressing someone at the start of a letter. How letters were delivered to the <em>ark</em> was intersting. Noah would wave a big <em>flag</em> and the post man would fire a <em>flag</em>-seeking <em>missile</em> full of letters for <strong>Mr</strong> Rhino and <strong>Mr</strong> Giraffe etc.		
井		well	Recalling that there are no circular strokes, and that the shape of the square and the square within a square (Frame 630) have already been used, it should be relatively easy to see how this character can be consider a pictograph of a <b>well</b>.		4	1946	1806	48	セイ、ショウ	い	I nearly died by falling in a <strong>well</strong>. Actually, on <em>two</em> separate occasions. I'm glad to see they've added these <em>fence posts</em>. Now the <strong>well</strong> will be much safer.

丼		donburi	"<i style='""font-weight:' bold>Donburi</i> is a bowl of rice with eel or meat on it. The character is a pictograph, perhaps designed by someone who felt that the portion of meat he was served with his bowl of rice looked to be no more than a tiny <i>drop</i> in the <i>well</i>."		5	1947	2884	48	トン、タン、ショウ、セイ	どんぶり	A little one is eating a<strong> domburi</strong> while standing over, looking down into, a WELL.

"A <strong>donburi</strong> is rice bowl, with <em>drops</em> of food (other than rice) and garnish on top.

耕		till	Christmas tree . . . well.		10	1949	1808	48	コウ	たがや.す	If you just grow your christmas tree in a well, there will be no need to<strong> till</strong> the soil.	A man was<strong> till</strong>ing a new plot to plant <em>xmas trees</em> but his tractor hit an old covered-up <em>well</em> and fell halfway in, he's asking for a new tractor for xmas..	Note:<strong> till</strong> in the sense of plow or cultivate, not until. (story: ergerg).	Plant a <em>Christmas tree</em> to mark the location of the <em>well</em>, so that those who are<strong> till</strong>ing the soil won't fall in.	"I kept drawing a complete blank every time this Kanji would come up, so I started thinking of the phrase ""don't open<strong> till</strong> Xmas"" that you often see on Christmas presents in cartoons and things. This brought the image of the Christmas tree to my mind, and from there I could use one of the other stories."		
亜		Asia	In this kanji, the abbreviation for <b>Asia</b>, you should be able to see the character for <i>mouth</i> behind the Roman numeral II.		7	1950	1809	48	ア、アシア	つ.ぐ	In<strong> Asia</strong>n countries, people use <em>II</em> chopsticks to get things into their <em>mouths</em>. Just imagine someone shoving a piece of sushi into their mouths with chopsticks.	A mouth barred up and not aloud to speak freely is the sign of<strong> asia</strong> (korea, China, pakistan etc).	In the Roman Empire there were signs marking where you were about to enter<strong> Asia</strong>. This was a dangerous place for Romans, so the sign consisted of a picture of <em>two Romans</em> (= <em>Roman two</em>) being eaten by a <em>mouth</em>.	<em>China</em> ( 中 ) taken two times should be about the total landmass of<strong> Asia</strong>.	There are 'II' things I love about<strong> ASIA</strong>: I) I can use my MOUTH to communicate in exotic languages, and II) I can use my MOUTH to suck on some nice<strong> ASIA</strong>N women's bodies!!

Asian hearts are <strong>bad</strong> and <strong>evil</strong>. They invented so much martial arts: karate, judo, kungfu, muay thai, silat, etc… just to hurt each other. They torture their own people (China, North Korea). They torture other people (Japan in China and Korea). And they are able to hide all this behind their nice facade of kindness. <strong>Bad</strong>, <strong>bad</strong> Asians. (did i shatter some people's ideas on Asia? my <strong>bad</strong>).	"In the chinese version of the music video for Michael Jackson's ""BAD"", the performers are dancing in sync in eighties music video fashion, wearing leather jackets, chains,<strong> bad</strong> jeans, dark glasses etc. Each time Michael Jackson sings ""I'm<strong> bad</strong>, I'm<strong> bad</strong> … you know it!"" they open their jackets and on their bare chests you can see a black tattoo of a heart.

(did i shatter some people's ideas on Whites? my<strong> bad</strong>).		
円		circle	This kanji, also used for Yen, is one you are not likely to need to study formally, since you can hardly get around in Japan without it. The connection is that the yennies, like pennies, are <b>circular</b> in shape. In any case, the elements are: <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i> . . . <i>one</i>.		4	1952	1811	48	エン	まる.い、まる、まど、まど.か、まろ.やか	The shape of a Yen coin.	"A poor old man is almost killing himself trying to lift a huge <em>glass hood</em> with his <em>cane</em> (using it as a lever), to get to just <em>one</em> yen coin. Note : the kanji refers to a circular, round object, but also to the Japanese currency (pronounced ""en"")."	A pictograph of a bank teller's window. The<strong> circle</strong>s are the coins which are passed back and forth for deposits and withdrawls.	Sometimes I wear my <em>top hat</em> under my <em>hood</em> and it makes my head look like a<strong> circle</strong>.	You may wonder why this character is pronounced 'en' yet is said 'yen' in the west, well this is because when it was first romanized the obsolete ゑ character was used and as such became yen in the west.		
角		angle	<i>Bound up</i> . . . <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i> . . . <i>two</i>. If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for <i>soil</i>, which would prompt you to write it in improper order.	* As a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right-<i>angles</i>.	7	1953	1812	48	カク	かど、つの	A museum display of two walking sticks bound together under a glass canopy, showing the first device used to measure an<strong> angle</strong>.	[+nuke] As a primitive, a boomerang. This boomerang is used to grab a bunch of meat, or <em>flesh</em>, lying around on the ground at a farm. First, you throw it straight at a <em>walking stick</em>, then it makes a right<strong> angle</strong> and goes to <em>walking stick</em> number <em>two</em>, and wraps around that. A quick tug, and you've got all the <em>flesh</em> flying toward you contained in that tri<strong>angle</strong>. Hooray for free (stolen) food!	[angle; corner; square; horn; antlers] I needed to measure an <strong>angle</strong>, so I improvised a rudimentary protractor by <em>bounding up</em> a <em>walking stick</em> to some <em>body part</em> of mine.	The<strong> ANGLE</strong> of a Boomerang? BOUND UP, thrown by the BODY, but is not a WALKING STICK thanks to that 90 degree<strong> ANGLE</strong> in each one. So as a primitive, use Boomerang.	If you bind up a circle with a rope, tied tightly it will have<strong> angle</strong>s.		
触		contact	Angle . . . insect.		13	1954	1813	48	ショク	ふ.れる、さわ.る、さわ	For <em>insects</em> to get in<strong> contact</strong> with each other, they need to place their antennae at just the right <em>angle</em>.	Wow, he threw that BOOMERANG with such skill, it made<strong> CONTACT</strong> with that INSECT in mid flight.	"This is commonly read as 触る （さわる）, meaning to touch or feel something. An <em>insect</em>'s version of <em>horns</em> are its antennae (see <a href=""../v4/1813.html"">contact</a> (#1813 触)). They are it's prime source of<strong> contact</strong> with the world and it uses them to touch and feel its way around."	Th e physics professor explains that, depending on the<strong> contact</strong> <em>angle</em>, the <em>bugs</em> hitting your windshield may splatter really good!	In the movie<strong> CONTACT</strong>, Jodie Foster has to turn the radio telescope at just the right ANGLE in order to pick up the alien signal. Unfortunately, just as she's found the perfect ANGLE, a huge INSECT lands on the receiver and scrambles the signal. Jodie has to bust ass and call her friend in Australia to pick up the signal.

If you stick the dagger in at exactly the correct angle, the whole cow will just<strong> unravel</strong>.	<strong>Unravel</strong> the mystery by determining at what ANGLE the SWORD went into the COW.	I tossed the BOOMERANG, which stuck like a DAGGER into a COW that I targeted. Now I watched the COW's insides begin to<strong> UNRAVEL</strong> from the cut.	To <strong>unravel</strong> this mystery, you have to consider it from the right <em>angle</em>. Remember the most important clue: The <em>dagger</em> was found lodged in the stable above the <em>cow</em>'s head! Once you see that <em>angle</em>, who would be able to place the <em>dagger</em> over the <em>cow</em>'s head, the whole puzzle will <strong>unravel</strong>.	Think: Piñata. Specifically, one in the shape of a <em>cow</em> that will completely<strong> unravel</strong> if <em>stabbed</em> at just the right <em>angle</em>.

講		lecture	Words . . . funnel.		17	1957	1816	48	コウ		I have a <em>funnel</em> attached to my laptop that takes my prof's<strong> lecture</strong> and puts the <em>words</em> into a text file. The bigger the funnel, the more accurate the conversion, so picture a bunch of laptops with large, unwieldy funnels attached to the USB port.	Image: a professor walking around with a <em>funnel</em> and simply pouring his <em>words</em> into each students head instead of a <strong>lecture</strong>.

購		subscription	<i>Shells</i> . . . <i>funnel</i>. The key word is meant to suggest magazine <b>subscriptions</b> and the like.		17	1958	1817	48	コウ		<strong>Subscription</strong> is like a money funnel, because the receiving end is small (just one company) and the other end is wide (the whole country).	My <strong>subscription</strong> to <em>Money</em> magazine came with a free coin <em>funnel</em>.	My<strong> subscription</strong> to Money magazine came with a free funnel.	You put your <em>shells</em> into a <em>funnel</em> at the newsagent to buy your<strong> subscription</strong> to Better Kanji Writing magazine.

A <strong>gutter</strong> takes the <em>water</em> that falls as rain and <em>funnels</em> it off to where it can be dealt with appropriately.	<em>Water</em> + <em>funnel</em> ==<strong> gutter</strong>. But really, if you need help with this one, how did you make it this far? :).	Instead of a normal<strong> gutter</strong>, the city is cutting costs by just putting a huge <em>celery funnel</em> on the side of the road every few hundred yards. While this is actually a bit more efficient than standard<strong> gutter</strong>s and quite cheap, it'sa bit dangerous (as there's a rather nasty juicing mechanism attached to the bottom of each one). Imagine telling some kids to stay out of the<strong> gutter</strong> on a rainy day, and one of them not heeding you (kids love splashing in them!) and falling to her doom.	[using 'diet' as right hand primitive] Alcoholics will land in the<strong> gutter</strong> if they keep up their <em>liquid diet</em> consisting of only alcohol.		
論		argument	<i>Words</i> . . . <i>meeting</i> . . . <i>scrapbook</i>.

"For <em>scrapbook</em> I used the image of a Panini sticker album, and thus the <em>meeting of scrapbooks</em> becomes a ""Panini sticker album convention"" (like a comics-con, only with collectors of Panini sticker albums).

During a talk at the <em>academic conference</em>, speaker shows an introductory slide depicting the structure of <em>car</em>, and then moves on to the more narrow topic of <strong>wheels</strong>.	At an <em>academic conference</em> many thousands of years ago, the uses of the<strong> wheel</strong> were discussed–eventually leading to the invention of the <em>car</em>. I sort of imagine a TED conference with cavemen discussing the<strong> wheel</strong> with a 2001 Space Oddesy-esc transition to Henry Ford also at a TED conference. (www.ted.com A seriously good website).	You have to be <em>methodical</em>. Before you invent the <em>car</em>, you'll need to invent the<strong> wheel</strong>.

He reads them for hours every day after work at his local konbini. (Primitive: <em>KONBINI HENTAI</em>, all the magazines(scrapbooks) by every konbini door in Japan).	Comic book is a nice idea. It's a sort of scrapbook that is like a door to a different kind of reality. Person is always<strong> partial</strong> (unfair) on the subject of comic books, because (s)he doesn't like them.	Right side: scrapbook on your door = <em>Heisig kanji poster</em>. Story: A <em>person</em> with a <em>Heisig kanji poster</em> is<strong> partial</strong> to the Heisig method.

冊		tome	This key word is a counter for books. It differs from <i>scrapbook</i> both in the writing order and in the extension of the second horizontal stroke.		5	1967	1826	48	サツ、サク	ふみ	Pictograph. I think of that Harry Potter spell book that had to be bound shut coz it wanted to eat you.	冊 さつ 1: counter for books A heavy scrapbook so full that flowers are sticking out.

Before I build him a <em>wooden</em><strong> palisade</strong>, the mighty leader gives me a mighty <em>tome</em> on the subject.	I'll let the tome primitive refer to a spell book, in order to keep it distinct. In that case, this kanji shows me a <em>wooden</em> <strong>palisade</strong> under siege by a few mages, trying to demolish it with their spells from the <em>spell book</em>.	A pallisade is made of wooden tree-trunks laid side by side like the pages of an ancient tome.	<em>Wooden tomes</em> form<strong> palisade</strong>s at the library.		
典		code	We introduce this character here because of its connection to the book-related kanji treated above. It is based on the character for <i>bend</i> (frame 1256), whose last stroke is lengthened to coincide with the first stroke of the element for <i>tool</i>.		8	1969	1827	48	テン、デン		<strong>Coding</strong> is a <em>tool</em> which you can use to <em>bend</em> the computer to your will.	"This kanji means a<strong> code</strong> of law, not a secret language or symbolic language (such as programming<strong> code</strong>) … Story: The<strong> code</strong> of law is a <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> citizens to society's will. You can use the image of a totalitarian state, but be careful not to confuse it with the pinnacle primitive <a href=""../v4/1294.html"">Heights</a> (#1294 阪)."	"Think ""codex"" (mnemonic help) or ""code of laws"", or even Leonardo Da Vinci's<strong> code</strong>. Here I see a<strong> code</strong>x as a <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> the masses into submission. Picture a huge<strong> code</strong>x book lifted down on crowds to bend them down in submission. Another: if you <em>bend</em> to the<strong> code</strong> without asking questions, you are a <em>tool</em>!"	Bender can be used as a tool for bending. But only if you know the right<strong> code</strong> (He never does want you want to).	<strong>Code</strong>/<strong>rules</strong> can be <em>bent</em> with the correct <em>tool</em>… (usually money).		
氏		family name	Pay close attention to the stroke order of the elements when learning to write this character. The elements: a long <i>drop</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> . . . a <i>one</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i>.		4	1970	1828	49	シ	うじ、-うじ	Looks a bit like Ft => <strong>F</strong>amily <strong>t</strong>itle =><strong> Family name</strong>.

This <em>box</em> is full of <em>arrows</em>. <em>Arrows</em> are special: armorer's <strong>family name</strong> is engraved on each arrowhead (hence last <em>dot</em> is left out).	Note that the stroke order of this is <em>drop</em>, <em>fishhook</em>, <em>one</em> (<strong>written as normal</strong>, not right to left as Heisig writes) then the second <em>fishhook</em>.	Hook, is both Hook's (from Peter Pan) first name and<strong> family name</strong>. So he's called <em>Hook Hook</em>. But he thought that was a bit silly so he <em>droped</em> the second hook and only uses <em>one</em>.

Spiderman regrets getting drunk last night. Peter Parker hands in his<strong> paper</strong> with the name Peter Spiderman–wrong family name. Oops!	<em>Spiderman</em> is very careful not to leave any piece of<strong> paper</strong> lying around with his <em>family name</em> on it (because he doesn't want to reveal his identity) …….[thanks Jasta].

Japan business etiquette tip: When someone hands you a <em>business card</em>,<strong> resist</strong> the impulse to fiddle around with it with your <em>fingers</em>, and by all means<strong> resist</strong> the urge to use the card to pick gunk from under your <em>finger</em>nails. Just examine it carefully, ask politely about the (few by now) kanji that you don't know, and put it away carefully in a location that shows your counterparts how important they are to you.	You have to<strong> resist</strong> using your <em>fingers</em> to present your <em>business card</em> the correct etiquette is to present it with both hands.	How do<strong> resist</strong> someone giving your their <em>business card</em>? Give them the <em>finger</em>.	<em>Fingers</em>, the thief, wouldn't have been caught.

In the deepest<strong> bottom</strong> of this <em>cave</em> complex, spelunkers leave their <em>calling cards</em> to prove they made it all the way.	Its unlikely for you to have a card if you're low in society. People living in caves must be at the<strong> bottom</strong> of society, so they sure as hell don't have one.

舗		shop	<i>Cottage</i> . . . <i>dog tag</i>. The key word refers to the noun, not the verb.		15	1982	1839	49	ホ		A<strong> shop</strong> in an impoverished country is just a cottage with a dog tag identifying it.	Normal cottages ( 舎 actually means a building) don't have tags advertising their names, but<strong> shop</strong>s do.	"Soldiers used to go the ""lady-shop"" at the edge of town. It was a little cottage stocked with women. All you had to do was show your dogtags to be admitted."	In Vietnam there is a little <em>cottage</em> industry of<strong> shop</strong>s producing and selling fake US <em>dog tags</em>. These<strong> shop</strong>s are starting to appear in Iraq and Afghanastan too.	This <em>cottage</em> is a<strong> shop</strong> that sells <em>Aibo dog tags</em>.		
補		supplement	Cloak . . . dog tag.		12	1983	1840	49	ホ	おぎな.う	"I usually hear<strong> supplement</strong> in ""dietry<strong> supplement</strong>"". So you're given a <em>cloak</em> for extra fibre and <em>dogtags</em> for extra iron. Keeps you regular and stops you feeling tired and run-down."	The name and number printed on a soldier's <em>cloak</em> is a<strong> supplement</strong> to his main I.D. tag; his <em>dog-tag</em>, in helping identify the soldier.	Ah yes, this dog tag perfectly<strong> supplement</strong>s my cloak!	Cloak + Dog Tag:<strong> Supplement</strong>s are provided to soldiers, along with <em>cloaks</em> and <em>dog tags</em>.	These days, many have to<strong> supplement</strong> their income to <em>cloak</em> their <em>offspring</em>.		
邸		residence	Calling card . . . city walls.		8	1984	1841	49	テイ	やしき	So fed up am I, I've finally built <em>city walls</em> around my<strong> residence</strong> to keep these Japanese from soliciting me with their <em>business cards</em>.	The <em>business card</em> says his<strong> residence</strong> is just to the left of the <em>city walls</em>. Can you find it? Yep, got it.	Suggestion- since we have the pinnacle on the left(which had a great potential for imaginative stories as we explored the ultimate society), the right side will be the pinnacle's opposite - the slum. It's so dangerous that a steep menacing city wall has been erected to keep its denizens in(and protect those outside). story: If your calling card said your<strong> residence</strong> was the slum, you'd be too ashamed to show it to anyone.	There are so many places of<strong> residence</strong> inside the city walls, I put a calling card outside mine so I can find my way home.	My <em>business card</em> shows that my<strong> residence</strong> is within the <em>city walls</em>.		
郭		enclosure	Receive . . . city walls.		11	1985	1842	49	カク	くるわ	The city finally <em>received</em> the<strong> enclosure</strong> that it desperately needed, <em>city walls</em> to protect it against attacks from the <em>tall kids</em>.	Even the <em>tall</em> <em>kids</em> can't get out of the<strong> enclosure</strong> that is the <em>city walls</em>.	As you can see, the tall kid peaks over the<strong> enclosure</strong> of the city walls to see the red light district (one of the meanings of the kanji).	(primitive city walls - slum. See residence 1841) in the slums, the city walls enlose everyone within. Some of the tall kids reckon they can clamber over the enlosing city walls, but even they fail.	"This Kanji also has the meaning of <strong>red-light district</strong> (probably an abbreviation from <a href=""../v4/2235.html"">licensed quarters</a> (#2235 廓)). Only <em>tall kids</em> are allowed to go there and leave the<strong> enclosure</strong> through the <em>city wall</em> to <em>receive</em> what they need so desperately."		
郡		county	Old boy . . . city walls.		10	1986	1843	49	グン	こうり	"<strong>County</strong> cricket. ""I say <em>old boy</em>, you've hit that ball clear over the <em>city walls</em>. That's six and out!""."	You can take the <em>good old boy</em> out of<strong> county</strong> (and into the <em>city walls</em>), but you can't take the<strong> county</strong> out of the <em>good old boy</em>. Is that how the saying goes?	A ぐん is smaller than a prefecture so you can see the city walls. It sounds like 君 (くん).	The <em>old boys</em> don't venture out into the<strong> county</strong>. They stay cooped up within the safety of the <em>city walls</em>.	The old boy had never been outside of his own<strong> county</strong> because he couldn't get over the city walls.		
郊		outskirts	Mingle . . . city walls.		9	1987	1844	49	コウ		The country folk and and the city folk mingle at the<strong> outskirts</strong> of town, just past the city walls.	The city walls mark the<strong> outskirts</strong> of the inner city, where it begins to mingle with the suburbs.	The city folks don't like to <em>mingle</em> with people from the<strong> outskirts</strong>. That's why they built such big <em>city walls</em>.	Many of the girls from the <em>slums</em> come to <em>mingle</em> near the<strong> outskirts</strong> of the slums–in the hopes that they can find a more wealthy guy to get them out of the hell hole.	(primitive city walls - slum. See residence 1841 - scotty28) On the <strong>outskirts</strong> of the community is the <em>slum</em>, where you dare not <em>mingle</em> with the slum dwellers - it's too dangerous.		
部		section	Muzzle . . . city walls.		11	1988	1845	49	ブ	-べ	Within the <em>city walls</em>, this<strong> section</strong> of town was so noisy that we had to <em>muzzle</em> them up.	"""<strong>Section</strong> 8 housing"" is a way to <em>muzzle</em> the impoverished people who are unable to pay rent but want to live inside the <em>city walls</em>."	(primitive city walls - slum. See residence 1841) A riot happens in one<strong> section</strong> of the slum. Rioting about the poor living conditions and treatment by the authorities. That<strong> section</strong> of the slum have muzzels fixed on them. Such demeaning treatment is typical in the slum.	The illegal israeli settlement has already muzzled the fuck out of all the land, so in order to further claim their (unwanted) presence. They muzzle the land (200m on both sides) of the Apartheid wall to<strong> section</strong> and part the land.	<strong>Sectioning</strong> is a term used in the UK that refers to putting a <em>muzzle</em> on someone and taking them inside the <em>city walls</em> to a mental hospital.

In a huge<strong> metropolis</strong>, it's hard not to feel like just <em>someone</em> within the <em>city walls</em>.	In the movie<strong> Metropolis</strong> by Fritz Lang, a robot <em>puppet</em> is used by the evil mayor to manipulate the poor part of the city. Picture the puppet robot on the <em>city walls</em>, giving a speech.	[my primitive for someone is ninja]A <strong>ninja</strong> must be able to scale the <strong>city walls</strong> of the<strong> Metropolis</strong> without being seen.	(primitive city walls - slum. See residence 1841) A futuristic<strong> metropolis</strong>, and within it's city walls it still has the problems of slums and new problems of citizens whose only human connection is to AI love dolls.		
郵		mail	Droop . . . city walls.		11	1990	1847	49	ユウ		The <em>drooping</em> <em>citywalls</em> was generating a lot of angry <strong>mail</strong> for the city officials.	The <em>city walls</em> <em>droop</em> down in one spot so that the<strong> mail</strong>man can throw the<strong> mail</strong> over.	<em>Droopy Dog</em> delivers the <strong>mail</strong> by walking along the <em>city walls</em> and throwing it to the people below.	"The <em>drooping</em> <em>citywalls</em> was generating a lot of angry <strong>mail</strong> for the city officials. Hint: think ""hate<strong> mail</strong>"" and you will remember this one. [thx CharleyGarrett]."	<strong>Mail</strong> never gets delivered correctly in the <em>slum</em> … the<strong> mail</strong>man is too busy <em>drooping</em> down so he doesn't get shot.

郷		hometown	Cocoon . . . silver . . . city walls.		11	1993	1849	49	キョウ、ゴウ	さと	Your hometown is where you broke out of your cocoon (born), and where you left when your hair was silver (died), your whole life was spent inside the city walls.	Your<strong> home town</strong> is where you earned enough <em>silver</em> to enable you to break out of your <em>giant cocoon</em> (leave home) and explore outside the <em>city walls</em>.	He never left his hometown, from the day he crept out of the family <em>cocoon</em> till the day his hair turned <em>silver-gray</em>, he never once crossed the <em>city walls</em>.	It's about time I leave my<strong> HOME TOWN</strong>…break out the <em>cocoon</em>, grab all my <em>silver</em>, and say goodbye to these <em>city walls</em>.	This always makes me think of Haibane Renmei, and the Home. They come in a cocoon, and can't pass the huge silver city walls.		
響		echo	Hometown . . . sound.		20	1994	1850	49	キョウ	ひび.く	People's voices are like<strong> echo</strong>es of <em>sounds</em> from their <em>hometowns</em>….you can always tell where they're from by how they talk.	My hometown is a ghost town, any sounds<strong> echo</strong>es and<strong> echo</strong>es.	Whenever I call long-distance back to my hometown, the sound on the line has a terrible<strong> echo</strong>!	The <em>sound</em> of your <em>hometown</em> always<strong> echo</strong>es in your ear when you travel abroad.	You go back to your <em>hometown</em> after a long time, and you find out that's been destroyed! The only <em>sound</em> you can hear as you walk among the ruins is the<strong> echo</strong> of your footsteps…		
郎		son	Halo . . . city walls.		9	1995	1851	49	ロウ、リョウ	おとこ	The <em>daughter</em> is a good girl that grows up to be a woman. The<strong> son</strong> is a <em>good</em> boy that grows up to defend the <em>city walls</em>.	Just like a daughter ( 娘 ) is good woman,<strong> son</strong> is good too, and stays safely inside city walls so as not to give his parents reason to worry.	Twin<strong> son</strong>s that were switched at birth.. the bad<strong> son</strong> lived in The Pinnacle, while the <em>good</em><strong> son</strong> lived in the <em>slums</em>.	Jesus, God's<strong> son</strong>, comes down to the <em>Wailing Wall</em> wearing a <em>halo</em> to preach to the hassids, but the they're too busy praying to notice anything out of the ordinary.	In the story of the Prodigal<strong> Son</strong>, the <em>good</em><strong> son</strong> stays within the <em>city walls</em>.		
廊		corridor	Cave . . . son.		12	1996	1852	49	ロウ		Your <em>son</em> plays in the<strong> corridor</strong> pretending he's exploring a <em>cave</em>.	A<strong> corridor</strong> is a bastard <em>son</em> of a <em>cave</em>. <strong>Corridors</strong> dream too, hoping one day they'll be as great as their father, the cave.	(ロウ) I think of the<strong> corridor</strong> found in the <em>cave</em> that Yoda made Luke Skywalker walk through as part of his Jedi training in Empire Strikes Back. It was in this<strong> corridor</strong> that Luke met Darth Vadar, cut off his head and found himself behind Darth Vadar's mask. An early little hint that Luke was Darth Vadar's <em>son</em>.	When I hear<strong> corridor</strong>, I think of a long, lonely hospital<strong> corridor</strong>. Imagine a war scene. Bombs are dropping from overhead. The good <em>sons</em>, who defended the city walls, are dropping like flies. The wounded <em>sons</em> are taken to the underground bomb shelter and hospital, in a <em>cave</em>. There are too many wounded <em>sons</em> for the hospital, so the wounded lie sprawled in the<strong> corridor</strong>, as the cave is still rocked by overhead bombs.	It would sure piss off superman if he found his <em>son</em> playing in the<strong> corridor</strong> pretending he's <em>batman</em>.		
盾		shield	Dragging . . . ten eyes.		9	1997	1853	50	ジュン	たて	This is a magic<strong> shield</strong> with <em>ten eyes</em> which have the power to <em>drag</em> the victim towards it.	You paint 10 huge eyes on your<strong> shield</strong> to scare the enemy, but consequently your<strong> shield</strong> is so big and heavy that you have to drag it.	"From Wikipedia: ""If a Spartan hoplite were to return to Sparta alive and without his<strong> shield</strong>, it was assumed that he threw his<strong> shield</strong> at the enemy in an effort to flee; an act punishable by death or banishment."" Picture the enemy of a Spartan soldier poking his <em>eyes</em> out with a <em>sewing needle</em> and trying to steal his<strong> shield</strong>. However, the Spartan desperately clutches on, and is <em>dragged around</em> for a while, preferring to die than to lose his<strong> shield</strong>."	TEN EYES = BEHOLDER. You use your<strong> SHIELD</strong> to block the BEHOLDERS rays and bounce them back on him. You DRAG his head home victorious.　.	Girls are being taught that if someone tries to drag them away, they should poke the harasser's eyes out with a needle. This type of precaution is well known, so harassers nowadays prepare themselves by carrying eyeshields, in order to deflect the needles.		
循		sequential	Line . . . shield.		12	1998	1854	50	ジュン		"This is mostly used in the word 循環 , ""circulation"" (of buses through their routes, of blood, etc). So I think of a column of little Roman soldiers with their shields marching<strong> sequential</strong>ly through the veins of a person, as an anthropomorphization of the immune system."	"A <em>column</em> of <em>shielded</em> soldiers advancing<strong> sequential</strong>ly to avoid revealing the size of their army (Think ""Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers"" from Star Wars)."	<em>Flash</em> can defeat the protection of the <em>shield</em>. The <em>ten</em> <em>eyes</em> open momentarily, but one after the other. He can blind them in a <strong>sequential</strong> fashion, and then attack an effectively blind opponent who cannot then <em>drag</em> the shield to meet the attack.	An army's <em>column</em> of marching <em>sheilds</em>, are lined up in<strong> sequential</strong> order.	The adventurers go in<strong> sequential</strong> order, with the shield bearing warrior in front to shield the other party members.		
派		faction	<i>Water</i> . . . <i>drag</i> . . . <i>rag</i>. Back in frame 1127 we indicated that this latter radical would come up once again, as it does in this and the following two frames.		9	1999	1855	50	ハ		Drag + rag gave me trouble until I came up with zombie for it. The zombie population became more diverse, separating into different<strong> faction</strong>s. One of them being the water Zombies.	The radical <strong>faction</strong> is almost eliminated, sir. They're living in the <em>sewers</em> dressed in <em>rags</em> and <em>dragging</em> their supplies.	The right hand side means <em>tributary</em>, and the <em>rag</em> part of it doesn't have the usual overlap with the first stroke. <strong>Factions</strong> split off from the main group like <em>tributaries</em> do from the main <em>water</em> course. <strong>Veins</strong> are the <em>tributaries</em> of your <em>body</em>.	WAter drag rag. The red<strong> faction</strong> must live underground in the watery sewers to avoid persecuption. They drag their supplies with them through the tunnels, each and every one clad in dirty rags.	"DRAG + RAG = ZOMBIE (walking around slowly, dragging feet, tattered rages…) In ""Left 4 Dead"" there are ""normal"" zombies and also some<strong> FACTION</strong>S of specialized zombies: Smoker, Hunter, Boomer, oh, and the WATER-spraying ""Soaker"" ZOMBIES. Thanks to revenantkioku for the zombie idea."		
脈		vein	Part of body . . . drag . . . rag.		10	2000	1856	50	ミャク	すじ	The<strong> vein</strong> is the part of the body most lusted after by the flesh hungry zombies (drag & rag - see revenantkioku frame 1855).	To get blood drawn from a<strong> vein</strong> you present the part of the body to the nurse, and they drag an alcohol swab (rag) across the<strong> vein</strong>.	The <em>part of the body</em> <em>zombies</em> hunger for is the brainzzz, not the <strong>veinzzz</strong>!	"Japanese zombies have trouble pronouncing v/b and r's, so they sound like they're saying ""Veeeeiiinns….. Veeeeiinnns…."" instead of a completely different part of the body."	"To poke a <strong>vein</strong>, the nurse asks you to expose some <em>flesh</em>. It's the way she asked that aggravated—""<em>drag</em> that <em>rag</em> up a bit!"" she said."		
衆		masses	Blood . . . drag . . . rag.		12	2001	1857	50	シュウ、シュ	おお.い	<strong>Masses</strong> of zombies, splattered with blood. (any zombie movie).	The stroke order is tricky. Draw the first two strokes of <em>rag</em> and then draw <em>drag</em> and then the last two strokes of <em>rag</em>, or at least so says WWWJDIC.	When the<strong> masses</strong> are hurt, say in a natural disaster like an earthquake, they can be seen everywhere dragging their bloody rags.	There was a lot of <em>blood</em> over the<strong> masses</strong> of <em>squashed zombies</em> I use 'squashed zombies' for the form of rag/drag with the two lines at the left.	The<strong> masses</strong> are a lynching mob. They're <em>dragging</em> a <em>bloody</em> victim in <em>rags</em> behind them.		
逓		parcel post	Drag . . . cornstalk . . . belt . . . road.		10	2002	1858	50	テイ	かわ.る、たがいに	(I prefer <em>2 towels</em> over cornstalk and belt) - Have you ever wondered why your parcels always end up in such bad condition when you get them? Or why you never get them at all? That's because you've never looked at how they're actually delivered - each postman is given a load of<strong> parcel post</strong> and <em>2 towels</em> to <em>drag</em> them down the <em>road</em> on.	In the ancient <strong>parcel post</strong>, they just would <em>drag</em> the packages behind them tied to <em>cornstalks</em> woven into a long <em>belt</em> down the <em>road</em>. It was a wonder than anything arrived intact.	People complained about the delivery methods of UPS after finding out that they loaded<strong> parcel post</strong> onto a <em>towel</em> and <em>dragged</em> it down the <em>road</em>. As a result, UPS have completely revamped their delivery system. Now they use <em>two towels</em>. (thanks Virtua Leaf).	"According to Jim Breen (whom I'm always inclined to trust more than Heisig) the keyword for this kanji should be <strong>relay</strong> (as in to send something). Story: when amazon.com get a complaint about their<strong> parcel post</strong>, they <strong>relay</strong> a message of apology to the customer with a gift of <em>belted up cornstalk</em>. The message attached says ""this gift of cornstalk has been <em>dragged</em> a long <em>road</em> straight from the amazon to your door"".."	In the days before UPS and suchlike the<strong> parcel post</strong> had to walk on the long country roads from town to town. This one is dragging behind him a sled full of packages and for himself he has a cornstalk hanging from his belt, as supplies.		
段		grade	The kanji connoting rank or class shows us a new element on the left: the familiar primitive for <i>staples</i> with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a <i>staple gun</i>. To the right, <i>missile</i>.		9	2003	1859	50	ダン、タン		This is a military-<strong>grade</strong> <em>staple gun</em>! It can be loaded with real <em>missiles</em>.	In order to get your 1st<strong> grade</strong>, or first-dan (だん) black belt, you have to learn hand to hand combat with new weapons - first the grapple involving the <em>staple gun</em>, and then the <em>missile</em> deployment technique.	"Imagine a really mean teacher who<strong> grade</strong>s papers with a staple-gun that shoots out staples (in a missile-like fashion) onto the paper to form the letter ""F"". She even uses such an opportunity as target practice. She gets way over to the other end of the class and shoots the little ""staple missiles"" onto the paper, cackling all the while."	When you are first dan, your punches hurt like a staple gun. When you are 10th dan, like a missile. So 1st<strong> grade</strong> is staple gun, 10th<strong> grade</strong> is missile. OR The first dan fellas are training with staplers. The 10th dan are whirling around rocket launchers (trick is not to set it off when you are doing all kind of fancy tricks. That is why there are so few 10 dans).	First<strong> grade</strong>rs in the army can use <em>staple guns</em>. Only when you are of high rank can you fire a <em>missile</em>.		
鍛		forge	Metal . . . grade.		17	2004	1860	50	タン	きた.える	As a discriminating metalsmith, I use the highest grade metals when forging such precision devices as staple guns and missiles.	Metal has to be<strong> forge</strong>d many times over in order to reach a high grade.	<em>Metal</em> is <em>graded</em> depending on how it was <em>forged</em>.	"Gassan Sadatoshi uses only high <em>grade metal</em> to<strong> forge</strong> his swords. <a href=""http://www.nihonto.ca/ko-gassan/"">http://www.nihonto.ca/ko-gassan/</a>."	You must use only the highest grade metals when you<strong> forge</strong> missile-loaded stapleguns.		
后		empress	Drag . . . one . . . mouth.		6	2005	1861	50	コウ、ゴ	きさき	The<strong> empress</strong> is cruel. Normally she'll violently pull her servants by the ear when they've failed to follow orders. But <em>one time</em> she <em>dragged</em> this one guy around the palace by the <em>mouth</em>. She must have been really angry—ever since that moment, he's never been seen again.	The <em>F</em> word often comes out of the <em>mouth</em> of the<strong> empress</strong>.	"This is <em>ax</em> with the last stroke replaced by a <em>mouth</em>, thus forming a pictograph of someone about to have his <em>mouth</em> chopped off for spreading rumors about the<strong> empress</strong>. ""Off with his <em>mouth</em>!"" [Thanks raulir!]."	The<strong> empress</strong> can have you <em>dragged</em> out of the room with just <em>one</em> word from her <em>mouth</em>.	We know the<strong> empress</strong> is really a <em>drag queen</em> because she only has <em>one mouth</em> Think about it….		
幻		phantasm	Cocoon . . . clothes hanger.		4	2006	1862	50	ゲン	まぼろし	After the play, The<strong> Phantasm</strong> of the Opera hangs up his cape on a <em>clothes hanger</em> and returns to his <em>cocoon</em> to sleep.	You open your closet and find strange, glowing cocoons sitting on your clothes hangers… definitely a<strong> phantasm</strong>!	The mother who has undergone a back-street abortion using a <em>clothes hanger</em> is having<strong> phantasm</strong>s (hallucinatory visions) of her dead baby hatching from a <em>cocoon</em>. The <em>cocoon</em> looks like the facehugger eggs from the original Alien movie poster.　まぼろし; hallucination/vision/mirage.	After the opera, The<strong> Phantasm</strong> hangs up his tuxedo on a <em>clothes hanger</em> and returns to his sleeping bag (<em>cocoon</em>) to sleep. (Didn't want to start sticking <em>cloak</em> in there by mistake). 幻 まぼろし phantom, vision, illusion, dream; 幻影 げんえい phantom, vision, illusion; 幻怪な げんかいな strange or mysterious and troubling.

""Don't bother putting your clothes on a <em>hanger</em>, just get started.""."	The<strong> director</strong> sticks a <em>clothes hanger</em> in each actor's <em>mouth</em> and hangs them from the <em>ceiling</em> until he needs them.	I think of this one as a pictograph of a guy talking on one of those headsets with a microphone attached - he's <strong>directing</strong> a movie, so he has to be constantly in touch with everyone!	Every<strong> director</strong> is the <em>same</em>( 同じ ). But this<strong> director</strong>, this one, he's different.	"This<strong> director</strong> is filming an ad for some washing powder. A bunch of kids are hanging from a clothes line, on <em>clothes hangers</em>. They aren't quiet and are making a lot of noise. Only one of them, at the center, is facing the camera and needs to deliver a line. The<strong> director</strong> becomes hysterical and using his megaphone yells at them ""SHUT UP!

Here, we see <em>Mr T</em> <strong>paying respects</strong> to an effigy of <em>Alfred Hitchcock</em>.	He may have turned out to be a lousy <em>director</em>, but you have to<strong> pay respects</strong> to George Lucas for having come up with the idea of <em>Jedi</em> in the first place. 伺う (うかがう) : (polite) visit, ask, inquire, hear, be told, implore (a god or an oracle); 伺候 しこう atttendance.		
詞		parts of speech	The key word, <b>parts of speech</b>, refers to nouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, and so on. The elements: <i>words</i> . . . <i>directors</i>.		12	2009	1865	50	シ		"The big mouthed <em>diretor</em> is even picky about the <strong>parts of speech</strong> you use, shouting, ""More verbs! Less adjectives!"" and such all the time."	A Grammar is basically a <em>word director</em> that tells us what part of speech each word is.	"This kanji is the ending of lots of<strong> parts of speech</strong> like noun, verb, adverb: 名詞 , 動詞 , 動詞 . People are messing around with <strong>parts of speech</strong> all the time now. <em>Company directors</em> are the worst, making up new <em>words</em> by verbing nouns and nouning verbs. ""please action that"", ""what is the take-home from that?""."	"This <em>director</em> speaks very fast. So fast that you can understand only <strong>parts of</strong> his <strong>speech</strong> (some of the <em>words</em>). To make it even more memorable, imagine that this <em>director</em> speaks in Japanese and you are his interpreter. All you can understand at your current level is only<strong> parts of speech</strong>. You think to yourself: ""Probably this word was a noun and that word was a verb, but what the hell is he speaking about?""."	A lot of the keywords in this book are a little difficult to figure out because you don't know the actual part of speech. Imagine a new edition with a friendly, chubby little <em>Alfred Hitchcock</em> holding a sign up telling you exactly which part of speech each word is.		
飼		domesticate	<i>Eat</i> . . . <i>director</i>. The sense is of rearing of animals.		13	2010	1866	50	シ	か.う	After a pride of hungry lions <em>ate</em> the <em>director</em>, the producer decided to tone down his documentary and film<strong> domesticate</strong>d cats instead.	When you<strong> DOMESTICATE</strong> a animal, you are the DIRECTOR of it's life and what it EATS.	We thought that the lion was<strong> domesticate</strong>d but it ate the Director !!!	<em>Alfred Hitchcock</em> really thought the pigeons in Birds were<strong> domesticate</strong>d, that was before they swooped down, carried of his star to <em>Mc Donalds</em> and <em>ate</em> him…	"In the film ""Grizzly Man"" the DIRECTOR tries to<strong> DOMESTICATE</strong> the bears but ends up being EATEN alive."		
嗣		heir	Mouth . . . scrapbook . . . director.		13	2011	1867	50	シ		The <em>director</em>'s <em>mouth</em> dropped open as he flipped through the <em>scrapbook</em> of properties he was about to become <strong>heir</strong> to.	"Careful with <a href=""../v4/1370.html"">inherit</a> (#1370 継). The egoistic <em>director</em> leaves instructions about what shall be handed down to his<strong> heir</strong> upon the director's death. First, the director's <em>mouth</em> should be surgically removed and preserved, to be handed down to his<strong> heir</strong>. Second, a scrapbook of the director's proudest scenes should also be handed down. The <em>mouth</em> reminds the<strong> heir</strong> that the <em>director</em> must be a loudmouth; the <em>scrapbook</em> reminds the<strong> heir</strong> of how to be a good director."	This kanji must be referring to Harry Potter. Is he the<strong> heir</strong> to Slytherin? Who knows? His <em>mouth</em> speaks parseltongue though, and Voldemort is trying to kill him from a magical <em>scrapbook</em>.. (or was that a diary? haha). Oh, and the <em>director</em> of the potions department hates him. Poor harry!	The <em>director's</em> son will be<strong> heir</strong> to a big <em>mouth</em> and a <em>scrapbook</em> full of directing instructions.	The<strong> heir</strong> opened his <em>mouth</em> in shock when the <em>director</em> of the estate told him he was only getting a <em>scrapbook</em>.		
舟		boat	After the <i>drop</i> and the <i>glass canopy</i>, we come to a combination of three strokes that we met only once before, in the character for <i>mama</i> (frame 105). The pictographic meaning we gave it there has no etymological relationship to this character, but use it if it helps.		6	2012	1868	50	シュウ	ふね、ふな-、-ぶね	I see this kanji as a pictograph of a two story<strong> boat</strong> seen from the front. The <em>glass canopy</em> is the body of the<strong> boat</strong>. The <em>drop</em> on top is the chimney. The horizontal line is the <em>ceiling/floor</em> between the the 1st/2nd floor. Finally, the <em>two drops</em> in the middle are the lights on the decks.	Pictograph of a<strong> boat</strong> seen from above. The middle line is the oars. The drop on top is the rudder (at the back of the<strong> boat</strong>). The two drops inside represent the passengers: one is bent over with the effort of rowing and the other is sitting up straight, in the front of the<strong> boat</strong>, looking at the horizon for any signs of land.	Cinnabar ( 丹 ) colored<strong> boat</strong>, the extra drop signifying that the paint hasn't dried yet. The stick represents the oars.	I <em>dropped</em> a<strong> boat</strong> on your <em>mom</em>.	New Primitive: <em>Titanic</em> with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.		
舶		liner	The type of <i>boat</i> connoted by this key word is a large oceangoing <b>liner</b>. The important thing here is to work with the elements <i>boat</i> and <i>dove</i> to make an image distinct from that of the former frame. Don't count on size alone to distinguish the <i>boat</i> from the <b>liner</b>.		11	2013	1869	50	ハク		The most famous<strong> LINER</strong> is the Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sunk. Just imagine that huge<strong> LINER</strong> strucking an even huger mass of <strong>white</strong> ice.	"A<strong> liner</strong> is to <em>boat</em> as an <a href=""../v4/261.html"">emperor</a> (#261 皇) is to a <a href=""../v4/255.html"">king</a> (#255 王), or a <a href=""../v4/967.html"">chief</a> (#967 伯) is to a <a href=""../v4/951.html"">person</a> (#951 人): in each case we need only add <em>white</em> to the latter in order to get the former."	Cruise<strong> Liner</strong>s are huge <em>boats</em> that always seem to be <em>white</em>.	Titanic was a big <em>boat</em> built by the <em>White</em> Star <em>Line</em>.	Noah's Ark was probably the first <em>boat</em> ever that might be considered a<strong> liner</strong>. Hey! there's the <em>white dove</em> that Noah sent out, and he has an olive branch in his beak!		
航		navigate	Boat . . . whirlwind.		10	2014	1870	50	コウ		"To<strong> navigate</strong> a ""boat"" through a ""whirlwind"" takes a skilled <strong>navigator</strong>."	In Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, you can<strong> navigate</strong> your <em>boat</em> by summoning <em>whirlwinds</em>.	Forrest Gump, being the fool that he is, decides to<strong> navigate</strong> his shrimping <em>boat</em> into the <em>whirlwind</em> instead of around it. Though through his perpetual dumb luck, he manages to be the only boat that survives the <em>whirlwind</em>….	The <em>Titanic</em> had a GPS <strong>Navigation</strong> system. The device saved the boat from a <em>whirlwind</em>, but it directed it towards an iceberg instead.	"""Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating through a <em>whirlwind</em> in a <em>boat</em> is approximately 3,720 to 1!"" ""Never tell me the odds.""."		
舷		gunwale	Boat . . . mysterious.		11	2015	2675	50	ゲン	ふなべい、ふなばた	The<strong> gunwale</strong> is perhaps the most <em>mysterious</em> part of a <em>boat</em> for it is neither a <strong>gun</strong> nor a <strong>whale</strong>.	"<strong>Gunwale</strong> (rhymes with ""tunnel"") is the top edge of the side of a <em>boat</em>, for example the widened lip on the sides of a canoe. The <em>mysterious</em> origin of this part of a <em>boat</em> comes from the strengthened sides of warships that used artillery (it means ""gun ridge"")."	Boat, gandalf: The <em>boats</em> obtained from Lady Galadriel were retrofitted with magic <strong>gunwales</strong> made by <em>Gandalf</em>. Now, nobody could fall overboard.	Gandalf always hangs out on the boat's<strong> gunwale</strong>, it's a mystery how the old bastard manages not to fall off.	The meaning of<strong> GUNWALE</strong> is MYSTERIOUS for everyone, except BOAT enthusiasts.		
般		carrier	Boat . . . missile.		10	2016	1871	50	ハン		"<strong>Carrier</strong>?! This means ""general"" (as in the general public or generally). OK..<strong> Carrier</strong>s, i.e. boats with missiles, are not available to the general public."	In general,<strong> carrier</strong> boats have missiles.	"For those who have the greasemonkey script, this kanji's keyword should be changed. I use <strong>run of the mill</strong> to avoid conflict with <a href=""../v4/1366.html"">general</a> (#1366 総). Story: Nowadays, even a <strong>run of the mill</strong> <em>boat</em> has <em>missile</em> launchers to protect themselves from pirates."	<strong>Generally</strong> speaking, aircraft<strong> carrier</strong>s are <em>boats</em> with <em>missiles</em>.	Be sure to protect the<strong> carrier</strong>. It's the boat with all our missiles, so if the enemy strikes it, it will explode VERY easily.		
盤		tray	Carrier . . . dish.		15	2017	1872	50	バン		"What do you call a ""CARRIER"" of DISHes? A<strong> TRAY</strong>."	Imagine a restaurant set in Disney's Fantasia or maybe in Harry Potter's university, where <em>dishes</em> are magically landing and taking off of a <em>carrier</em><strong> tray</strong>.	"""This, my friend, is no run of the mill dish! Look at its finely crafted handles, its size great to hold dishes itself! No, my friend, THIS is a<strong> TRAY</strong>!""

搬		conveyor	Fingers . . . carrier.		13	2018	1873	50	ハン		When workers neglect workplace safety, their fingers get cut off and carried away by the<strong> conveyor</strong> belt, which looks like a 'finger carrier' in that case.	During WWII, morse code was the primary means of communication from sea. The morse code specialist was the<strong> conveyor</strong> of messages to and from the crew of the carrier, using his fingers to tap out the secret messages. (This works especially well for 搬送周波数 carrier frequency and 搬送波 carrier wave, being the radio waves/frequencies used in morse code).	<em>Fingers</em> take food from the sushi <em>carrier</em>, a<strong> conveyor</strong> belt.	"This is not used in kaitensushi. It means more like, ""carry out/in, delivery."" STORY: GENERALLY, you can use your FINGERS to CARRY some take-out home."	A<strong> conveyor</strong> belt carries sushi to your waiting fingers.		
船		ship	Boat . . . gully.		11	2019	1874	50	セン	ふね、ふな-	A boy floats his toy <em>boat</em> in a <em>gully</em> and imagines it as an immense <strong>ship</strong>.	"Aargh, hard to keep this separate from boat. How about this: the phrase ""shape up or<strong> ship</strong> out!"" This phrase originally meant that a soldier had better get his act together, or else face being<strong> ship</strong>ped off into a combat zone. Here we see a poor WW-I soldier who has been<strong> ship</strong>ped off to a combat zone. He's riding in the <em>boat</em> overseas to fight in the <em>trenches</em> (<em>gulley</em>)."	A<strong> ship</strong> is a <strong>boat</strong> so big, it makes a river look like a <strong>gully</strong>.	A <em>boat</em> in a <em>gully</em> looks like a huge<strong> ship</strong>.

艦		warship	Boat . . . oversee.		21	2020	1875	50	カン		The<strong> warship</strong> towers over the smaller benign <em>boats</em>, <em>overseeing</em> their safe path from port to port.	A<strong> warship</strong> is a <em>boat</em> that <em>oversees</em> the seas. Think of it as the patroller of the ocean.	On a normal boat, you do what you want: play shuffleboard, pig out at the buffet, sunbathe. On a<strong> warship</strong> though, there's an overseer making you swab this, batten that, and hoist the other thing.	On the<strong> warship</strong> (antique one) there are slaves, the losers of battle. They are overseen by the slave master in a reclyner who oversees the slaves eating all from one plate. As soon as the slaves have finished eating from the one plate, back to work again.	A <em>boat </em> that <em>oversees</em> destruction is a<strong> warship</strong>.		
艇		rowboat	Boat . . . courts.		13	2021	1876	50	テイ		In venice, the <em>boat</em> used by the <em>courts</em> to transport criminals is a<strong> rowboat</strong>.	Courts in olden times would often punish convicts by sentencing them to a life of being the rower crew for large<strong> rowboat</strong> ships (there were no engines or boilers back then)… Yo ho, Yo ho….	"""Row, row, row your <em>boat</em>….."". Imagine someone who goes to <em>court</em>, claiming they wrote this song first."	Sometimes abstract imagery works very well. Imagine someone showing up to <strong>court</strong> in a <strong>rowboat</strong>. Really imagine them rowing it across the floor and you won't forget this Kanji.	"There's a phrase in English to ""send you up the river,"" meaning to be sent to jail. If you think of this then all you have to do is picture the courts sending you up the river in a boat… a<strong> rowboat</strong> to be precise. If it helps, you can also think of your state then as being ""up the creek without a paddle.""."		
瓜		melon	The only thing that distinguishes this from the <i>claw</i> is the addition of the <i>elbow</i>, made by doubling up the third stroke and adding a fourth.		6	2022	1877	50	カ、ケ	うり	何これ ???? ok, sorry to be crude… if you claw at a girls<strong> melon</strong>s, she is gonna give you the elbow.	M for<strong> melon</strong>. 瓜 elon.	Vegetarian <em>vultures</em> are fighting for a <strong>melon</strong>, each trying to <em>elbow</em> its way to it with <em>claws</em>.	The housewives <em>CLAW</em>ed and <em>ELBOW</em>ed each other to buy the first<strong> MELON</strong> of the season.	To top yorkii's crudeness: while girls have juicy<strong> melon</strong>s on them, they are well protected with claws and elbows.		
弧		arc	Bow . . . melon.		9	2023	1878	50	コ		"Joan of<strong> Arc</strong> (""arc"" also means ""bow"" in french) is practicing with a <em>bow</em>, shooting at <em>melons</em> in a distant field."	When you use a <em>bow</em> to shoot a <em>melon</em>, the<strong> arc</strong> varies depending on how far away you are.	<strong>Arc</strong>–>arch–> a girl <strong>arches</strong> her back as <em>Legolas</em> strokes her <em>melons</em>.	You'll make a very short, steep<strong> arc</strong> if you shoot a melon from a bow. And then the melon will break, which is sad. And then your mouth will likewise be an<strong> arc</strong> (of sadness)–frown. :(.	Both a bow and a melon are<strong> arc</strong>-shaped.		
孤		orphan	Child . . . melon.		9	2024	1879	50	コ		An<strong> orphan</strong> will never know the joys on sucking on his mother's melons……..	Unlike the celebrated story of Momotaro the peach boy, no one knows the story of the melon boy who was left an<strong> orphan</strong>.	"This is the happier version of Oliver Twist. Here the<strong> orphan</strong>ed <em>children</em> are served fresh <em>melon</em> with every meal. ""Please, sir, may I have some more <em>melon</em>?"" ""Why, of course, help yourself!""."	The<strong> orphan</strong> CHILD popped out of the MELON.	Adopt an<strong> orphan</strong> child today and receive a free melon.		
繭		cocoon	Though it's a good thing that the primitive for <b>cocoon</b> has been radically abbreviated from this, its full form as a kanji, the story it holds is a charming one. The silkworm (<i>insect</i>) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the <i>flowers</i>), digests them and transforms them into <i>thread</i> with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the <i>hood</i>). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception.		18	2025	1880	51	ケン	まゆ、きぬ	This is a simple two-column manga showing the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a<strong> cocoon</strong>. First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar (<em>insect</em>). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the <em>insect</em> covered with <em>thread</em>, making a beautiful<strong> cocoon</strong>.	I dont like lesson 51 so far.	The magic <em>flower</em> is the reason why <em>Spider-Man</em> ended up miniaturized and confined inside a <em>hood</em>-like <strong>cocoon</strong> together with an <em>insect</em>. Now, only a <em>walking stick</em> separates them both.	See book, one of the good stories you can remember from there.	<em>Spider-Man</em> bent over to pick up a pretty <em>flower</em> when a giant <em>glass hood</em> dropped over him- it's a trap! Now he's stuck inside, fending off a swarm <em>insect</em> with his <em>walking stick</em> as they try to wrap him in a<strong> cocoon</strong>. Could this be the end of <em>Spider-Man</em>?!		
益		benefit	Poised over the <i>dish</i> here is a pair of <i>animal horns</i> that are attached to a pair of <i>animal legs</i> by a single horizontal stroke.		10	2026	1881	51	エキ、ヤク	ま.す	The<strong> benefit</strong> of having sharp <em>horns</em> and fast <em>legs</em> is that an animal can get to the food <em>dish</em> first.	The<strong> benefit</strong> of being an animal with <em>horns</em> and fast <em>legs</em> is in keeping it from becoming a <em>dish</em> for the other animals! (shaydwyrm).	The resturant I worked at had no real<strong> benefit</strong>s (vaction time, sick leave, etc), except for one-free meals. However, the meals sucked. Basically, we were given left overs, consiting of <em>animal horns, and animal legs</em>, on a plain <em>dish</em>.	Friends with<strong> BENEFIT</strong>S, is basically a HORNY friend who spreads their LEGS and offers themselves on a silver PLATE.	( ノಠ益ಠ )ノ彡┻━┻ THEESH KANJI HAS NO<strong> BENEFIT</strong> TO ME!!!!!!!!! RAGE!!!!!!		
暇		spare time	"The element for <i>day</i> on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see <i>staples</i> being held in <i>mouth</i> (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's <b>spare time</b>. The small <i>box</i> at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly ""inside out."" Finally, we have the <i>crotch</i> at the bottom."		13	2027	1882	51	カ	ひま、いとま	Some jackass-like people have way too much<strong> spare time</strong>. You can find video's of them all over the internet, if you like such things, you can watch it all <em>day</em>. You see them <em>stapling</em> their <em>mouths</em> shut, or throwing eachother <em>upside down in boxes</em> or kicking each other in the <em>crotch</em>.	"Tip: The complex right side of this kanji appears twice more in Heisig. He later names it ""hobby"". REF: <a href=""../v4/2689.html"">shrimp</a> (#2689 蝦), <a href=""../v4/2779.html"">haze</a> (#2779 霞)."	"I avoid using ""mouth"" here because it makes me mess up the stroke order. Instead I use a flag/staple combo. Hopefully you've seen the Justin Timberlake ""dick in a box"" spoof. Someone has a lot of<strong> spare time</strong>, so he decides to spend the <em>day</em> making an especially elaborate dick in a box. There's a <em>flag</em> <em>stapled</em> to the box as decoration (like wrapping paper). He rigs it up so he can instantly flip the <em>box inside-out</em> to reveal his <em>crotch</em>. Well, it's a vivid image once you get it. He's my hero."	"A pervert's <strong>hobby</strong> (see Katsuo): He turns <em>two boxes</em> upside-down (""コ"") and <em>staples</em> them together - that makes them look like a bench. Then he hides in it and waits until some girls come and sit down. What can he see? Of course their <em>crotches</em>! If he does that all <em>day</em> he won't have<strong> spare time</strong> for anything else."	"WARNING EXPLICIT!!! In my<strong> spare time</strong>, basically all DAY long, I STAPLE a few things to the wall. a picture of a woman's mouth and outward facing ""box"". I think you know what I do with my crotch."		
敷		spread	At the top we have the <i>arrowhead</i> whose vertical line joins it to the <i>rice field</i> (or <i>brains</i>) below it. Beneath it, the <i>compass</i>; and to the right, the <i>taskmaster</i>.		15	2028	1883	51	フ	し.く、-し.き	<em>Arrowheads</em> are <strong>spread</strong> all over the <em>field</em>. The <em>taskmaster</em> profiteerer forces you to find them all using a <em>compass</em>.	"Instead of being glued to one <a href=""../v4/46.html"">specialty</a> (#46 専) 専 , I decided to<strong> spread</strong> my attention in many directions 方 , and be a taskmaster at none."	"Gory story: Instead of <em>setting you free</em>, the taskmaster said ""Spread em!"", raped you, and drove an <em>arrowhead</em> into your <em>brain</em>."	I assasinated the <em>taskmasker</em>. When the arrowhead hit his <em>brain</em>, bits and pieces<strong> spread</strong> out in all <em>directions</em>.	This is the （しき）used in ふろしき 風呂敷 , which is when the Japanese bundle something in a large cloth, then gather the ends togther and tie it at the top to carry it around. Story: Imagine an eccentric <em>taskmaster</em> who feels the need to carry a gigantic ふろしき everywhere for his picnics, so he can<strong> spread</strong> it in all <em>directions</em>, cover a whole <em>field</em> and pins the corners to the ground with stone <em>arrowheads</em>.		
来		come	This odd but common kanji is built up of the character for <i>not yet</i> into which a pair of <i>animal horns</i> has been inserted.		7	2029	1884	51	ライ、タイ	く.る、きた.る、きた.す、き.たす、き.たる、き、こ	You <em>horny</em> bastard, don't<strong> come</strong>, at least <em>not yet</em>!	When I<strong> come</strong> home, there's nobody and no dinner waiting for me. Sigh…<em>rice</em> for <em>one</em> again.	"Here I see, of all things, Bambi. His <em>animal horns</em> have <em>not yet</em><strong> come</strong> out. (As we can see in the kanji, the <em>animal horns</em> are not at the top, not ""poking through"". ) Remember: Bambi will soon<strong> come</strong> to have a great set of <em>animal horns</em> but they have <em>not yet</em><strong> come</strong> out."	"Last words of the Bible: ""Come, Lord Jesus,<strong> come</strong>."" The Devil pokes his HORNS up and says: NOT YET!"	One bowl of rice comin' up.		
気		spirit	The <b>spirit</b> in this character refers to the changeable moods and airs of one's personality as well as to the more essential combination of vital forces that distinguish things and individuals one from the other. Its elements are: <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>floor</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> . . . <i>sheaf</i>. Do not confuse with <i>spirits</i> (Frame 1930).		6	2030	1885	51	キ、ケ	いき	<em>Captain Hook</em>, his <strong>spirit</strong> crushed, is lying on the ground cursing <em>Wolverine</em> who has defeated him with his far superior claws.	You're reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you've been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning<strong> spirit</strong>.	<em>Wolverine</em> has a fighting<strong> spirit</strong>, and even while <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> sharpens the <em>hooks</em> on his claws.	"Hint : the first four strokes may be seen as <em>Captain Hook</em> : <em>reclining on the floor</em>, shaking his <em>hook</em> in the air and moaning ""Peter Pan! Why did you elude me again! Whyyy!"". Se here we have Captain Hook having one of his fits, and about the only thing that will bring him his<strong> spirit</strong> back is a <em>sheaf</em>. The last part probably won't make sense but I am French speaking and somehow I settled onto the image of a ""bouquet"" of flowers for the word ""sheaf""."	"Someone is <em>lying</em> on the <em>floor</em>, a huge <em>x</em> ripped into their stomach with a <em>fishhook</em>. A passer by says ""Gen<strong>ki</strong> desu ka""."		
汽		vapor	Think of this character as a sibling of that for <i>spirit</i>. Simply replace <i>sheaves</i> with drops of <i>water</i> on the left in order to get <i>vapor</i>.		7	2031	1886	51	キ		Water<strong> vapor</strong> almost looks like a spirit but has no soul.	Wolverine disappears into <em>water</em><strong> vapor</strong>, seemingly his <em>spirit</em> dissipating into nothingness.	In this scene, Captain Hook is RECLINING on the FLOOR with his HOOK in the air in the desert. He is drying up dying, you can even see the WATER<strong> VAPOR</strong> being sucked right out of him.	<strong>Vapor</strong> is the <em>water's</em> <em>spirit</em> with no <em>x</em>, the unknown quantity for soul.	<em>Captain Hook</em> enjoys nothing more than to <em>lie on the floor</em> of his ship while the cool <em>water</em><strong> vapor</strong> from the ocean waves sprays his face.		
飛		fly	The two <i>large hooks</i> have little propellers (the two <i>drops</i> on each <i>hook</i>) attached to them for <b>flying</b>. Beneath is the <i>measuring box</i>, which serves as the body of this <b>flying</b> contraption. The stroke order will cause some problems, so take care with it.		9	2032	1887	51	ヒ	と.ぶ、と.ばす、-と.ばす	Hooks with small wings attached look like hummingbirds with a long beak. Two hummingbirds are trying to<strong> fly</strong> away with our little measuring box. What do they want it for?	Two <em>hummingbirds</em><strong> fly</strong>ing to feed at a <em>measuring box</em> filled with sugar water. <strong>This kanji is famous for having hard-to-remember stroke order. </strong> Try it this way: first a <em>hummingbird</em> <strong>flies</strong> over the <em>measuring box walls backwards</em>. But finally the other <em>hummingbird</em> manages to stick its beak right through them.	Captain <em>hook</em><strong> fly</strong>ing in a <em>measuring</em> box with two <em>propellers</em>.	(To keep the stroke order)<strong> Fly</strong>ing by, you see a <em>hummingbird</em> land on a <em>walking stick</em>. The bird looks around and sees a <em>person</em> nearby bending over, and gives the signal to attack. In swoops a second <em>hummingbird</em>, poking it's beak right into his back. Ouch!	I learnt this Kanji a long time ago, when I was a kid, and the image I had for it is so vivid it's served me well, and I thought I'd share it. This Kanji is <em>two hummingbirds</em><strong> fly</strong>ing over a field of <em>asparagus stalks</em>. But one flew too low, and got its beak stuck through two stalks.		
沈		sink	The technique for <b>sinking</b> used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a <i>crown</i> tied about one <i>leg</i> before the unfortunate party is tossed into the <i>water</i>.		7	2033	1888	51	チン、ジン	しず.む、しず.める	(thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she<strong> sink</strong>s. She shouldn't have been so nosy about her yakuza-boyfriend's schemes.	"This is the famous story of Archimedes and the Crown, where buoyancy was discovered. Watching the <em>crown</em><strong> sink</strong> in the <em>water</em>, Archimedes detected the fraud and ran naked through the city (<em>human legs</em> distorted from running) yelling ""Eureka! Eureka!"" See <a href=""http://math.nyu.edu/"">http://math.nyu.edu/</a>~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29</a>."	A mob of peasants throws a noble into the <em>waters</em>, his <em>human legs</em> stuck into the <em>crown</em> he was wearing proudly just a minute before (this later image for the special primitive combo on the right). The poor guy<strong> sink</strong>s to his death, unable to swim back up. Sunk by his <em>crown</em>!	The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a heavy crown to make sure she<strong> sink</strong>s.	If you're in the <em>water</em> and your <em>legs are squeezed together inside a tight crown</em> you won't be able to swim properly - you'll just<strong> sink</strong>.		
枕		pillow	Tree . . . crown tied around leg of person.		8	2034	2472	51	チン、シン	まくら	"The guy who was thrown into the river to sink was given one last request. ""If I'm gonna be sleeping with the fishes,"" he said, ""can I at least have a<strong> pillow</strong>? I'm real sensitive."" The mafia bosses laughed. ""Look, my doctor said I can only use <em>wooden</em><strong> pillow</strong>s, I have a real serious condition. Can I at least die comfortable-like?"" The mafia dudes said fine, and let him have his<strong> pillow</strong>. They tossed him the river and drove off…and after a minute, he bobbed to the top, thanks to his floating <em>wood</em><strong> pillow</strong>."

(Mature audiences only) As my <em>wood</em> began to <em>sink</em> into her, she moaned into the <strong>pillow</strong>, not wanting to awaken the neighbors with screams of ecstasy.	Some Japanese people sleep with a<strong> pillow</strong> made of <em>wood</em>, in case there's a flood in the middle of the night. Because <strong>pillows</strong> made of <em>wood</em> do not <em>sink</em>, they need never fear falling asleep without a flotation device nearby.	(Mature audiences only) As my <em>wood</em> began to <em>sink</em> into her, she moaned into the <strong>pillow</strong>, not wanting to awaken the neighbors with screams of… pain. It was her first time, and <strong>she wasn't wet!!</strong> (Thanks Corodon).		
妻		wife	Ten . . . rakes . . . woman.		8	2035	1889	51	サイ	つま	Ten rakes woman. your<strong> wife</strong> digs her fingernails into you and it feels like 10 rakes when she finds you ontop of another woman.	"(I'm really not sexist, this just helps me remember the kanji): I make my<strong> WIFE</strong> do all the yard work, and as a really mean joke, I bought her TEN RAKES for her birthday this year. ""Do the yardwork, WOMAN! You have TEN perfectly good RAKES to choose from!""."	Your<strong> wife</strong>'s fingernails are like ten rakes clawing into you. What a savage woman.	I have multiple <strong>wives</strong>. <em>Ten</em> to be exact. It makes it mighty easy to <em>rake</em> leaves in the fall.

凄		nifty	Ice . . . wife.		10	2036	2133	51	セイ、サイ	さむ.い、すご.い、すさ.まじい	Sugoi! Sugoi! Ice Wife Sugoi!	His <em>wife</em> has a<strong> nifty</strong> way of making all types of <em>ice</em> cream in her home freezer.	"I prefer keyword ""terrific"" for this as the Japanese meaning can be either ""great"" or ""dreadful"". Story: freezing your wife is a terrific idea, she can still look pretty and you don't have to listen to all the nagging."	"A word like<strong> nifty</strong> makes you think of the 50's, and a <em>housewife</em> so impressed with the new <em>freeze</em>r that she says ""oh, how<strong> nifty</strong>!""."	"My <em>ice-cold wife</em> would beat me down if I ever insulted her, so I often tell her she's <strong>凄い</strong> (sugoi), which she takes to mean amazing but what I actually mean is dreadful. ————————- (I use すごい (sugoi) as a keyword because I already know it, but if you wanna use an English keyword, I like herman's suggestion of ""terrific."")."		
衰		decline	Let this key word connote the <b>decline</b> and fall of the Roman Empire. It shows a fellow in a <i>top hat</i> and <i>scarf</i>, trying hard to look happy by putting a <i>walking stick</i> in his <i>mouth</i> sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.		10	2037	1890	51	スイ	おとろ.える	If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven't seen him after his<strong> decline</strong>. Here he is carrying a stick around in his mouth like a dog, begging people to throw it for him. Note that the mouth is closed only after the stick goes in, as is only logical.	My kanji writing ability has<strong> decline</strong>d so much even my <em>one</em> looks <em>pathetic</em>.	If you thought that the dude in 哀 was <em>pathetic</em>, you haven't seen him after his<strong> decline</strong>. Here he is carrying a <em>stick </em>around in his <em>mouth</em> like a dog, allowing people to rent him and play catch with him for money!	<em>One pathetic</em> decision after another led to the<strong> decline</strong> and fall of the Roman Empire.	"Ever since the guy from <a href=""../v4/401.html"">pathetic</a> (#401 哀) got a<strong> decline</strong>d by a girl and a <em>walking stick</em> rammed in his mouth sideways, his life has been in<strong> decline</strong>; a downward spiral."		
衷		inmost	Between the <i>top hat</i> and the <i>scarf</i> you will see the character for <i>in</i> which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the <i>scarf</i>. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright.		9	2038	1891	51	チュウ		"The guy from <a href=""../v4/401.html"">pathetic</a> (#401 哀) shared his<strong> inmost</strong> feelings with a girl and she rammed a <em>walking stick</em> down his throat. It ruptured his<strong> inmost</strong> organs."	Besides making money from acting like a dog (see decline), the <em>pathetic</em> man has risked his<strong> inmost</strong> internal organs by becoming a <em>cane</em> swallower!	I'm going with 9 strokes: the magician pulled <em>10 scarves</em> from the <strong>inmost</strong> part of his <em>mouth</em>.	<strong>Note</strong>: Incorrect stroke order and count in book. Is written <em>one</em>, <em>mouth</em>, <em>walking stick</em>, <em>scarf</em>, with 9 strokes. [It evolved from a combination of <em>garment</em> and <em>in</em> (meaning undergarments), so maybe it used to be written as described in the book…].	The <em>pathetic</em> emo guy is always talking about his<strong> inmost</strong> feelings. Sometimes I want to shove a <em>walking stick</em> in his <em>mouth</em> to stop him talking.		
面		mask	Imagine a <b>mask</b> over your head with <i>eyes</i> peeping out from all over the head, a <i>hundred</i> in all (the element for <i>eye</i> displacing the fifth stroke of that for <i>hundred</i>).		9	2039	1892	51	メン、ベン	おも、おもて、つら	When Jim Carrey puts on <strong>The<strong> Mask</strong></strong>, he can make it seem like he has <em>100 eyes</em> popping out of his head.	If you're wearing a<strong> mask</strong>, a <em>hundred</em> <em>eyes</em> can look at you but none of them will know who you are.	I see this as the comb primitive combined with the kanji for 3 giving the same stroke order :). So picture a person wearing 3 combs on their face as a<strong> mask</strong>. メン.	A<strong> mask</strong> with one big eye in the middle. (and a funny haircut on top).	A<strong> mask</strong> with a hundred eyes.		
麺		noodles	Barley . . . mask.		16	2040	2752	51	メン、ベン	むぎこ	There is a certain restaurant in West-Shinjuku that serves its<strong> noodles</strong> made of BARLEY in a MASK instead of a plate. I love these theme-restaurants!	I always eat <em>barley</em><strong> noodles</strong> with a <em>mask</em> on - it stops them splashing in your face.	Don't be fooled! That's just <em>barley masq</em>uerading as<strong> noodles</strong>.	"素麺 , 老麺 , 麺 (麵)<a href=""../v4/2752.html"">noodles</a> (#2752 麺) メン … Parts: 麦 , 面 … The most common use for this, Ramen, is actually written in Kana exclusively. The Kanji is used to talk about the<strong> noodles</strong> themselves before they are cooked into a dish. … Story: How did <em>Chris Barley</em> get so fat? He lived near an all-you-can-eat <strong>Noodle</strong> shop (Ramen, Somen, etc.). Even after they banned him, he would just put on a mask and keep coming back. Richard Nixon mask? Check. Tony Blair Mask? No good, that mouth is too small."	A <em>mask</em> made entirely of <em>barley</em><strong> noodles</strong>.		
革		leather	After the <i>flowers</i> at the top (painted on the <b>leather</b> for decoration), we see the element for <i>car</i> with the middle stroke left out. Think of the seats having been taken out so that they can be reupholstered with this decorated <b>leather</b>.		9	2041	1893	51	カク	かわ	You can feed <em>twenty mouths</em> for a year for the price of <em>ten</em><strong> leather</strong> coats.	I asked the street vendor the price of the<strong> LEATHER</strong> jacket. He said TWENTY, but with my MOUTH, I talked him down to TEN. (correct stroke order).	This kanji depicts a<strong> leather</strong> jacket wearing gang of <em>20</em> people. To make themselves look even tougher, they all have <em>needles</em> in their <em>mouths</em> (i.e. piercings, but here of a specific kind).	My<strong> leather</strong> belt has <em>twenty openings</em> for the <em>needle</em> of my buckle to go through.	In this<strong> leather</strong> belt there are <em>20</em> ( 廿 ) small holes or <em>openings</em> ( 口 ) made with a <em>needle</em> ( 十 ) to compensate for increases in girth.		
靴		shoes	Leather . . . change.		13	2042	1894	51	カ	くつ	<em>Leather</em><strong> shoes</strong> are nice because they <em>change</em> shape to fit your foot.	<em>Leather</em> is often <em>changed</em> into<strong> shoes</strong>.	"If you buy <em>leather</em><strong> shoes</strong>, you have to ""break them in"" - wear them so that they <em>change</em> shape to fit your foot."	I wear my nice <em>leather</em><strong> shoes</strong> whenever I go out dancing. I hate wearing too much in my pockets when I dance, so if I ever need <em>change</em>, I just reach into my<strong> shoes</strong> where I've stashed a bunch of spare <em>change</em>.	<strong>SHOES</strong> used to be made out of LEATHER, but that has CHANGED.		
覇		hegemony	Old West . . . leather . . . moon.		19	2043	1895	51	ハ、ハク	はたがしら	In the <em>Old West</em>, cowboys had <strong>hegemony</strong> OVER the Indians despite their <em>leather</em>craft and ability to navigate by the <em>moon</em>.	In the old west, animal skins were made into leather and their flesh was eaten, thus using the whole animal, which viewed from the animal side could be taken as humans asserting complete<strong> hegemony</strong> over them. All your base are belong to us.	In the <em>Old West</em>,<strong> hegemony</strong> over Indians was ensured by binding and whipping the Indians' <em>flesh</em> with <em>leather</em> straps.	Leather + flesh = scalping. It's commonly believed that the Indians invented scalping but in fact it was the American colonists that created the practice of cutting off a dead Indian's hair + skin as proof of the kill. In response the Indians started doing the same to them, but history is written by the winners so most people blame the Indians for this barbaric practice. (true story) In the Old West, colonists exercised their<strong> hegemony</strong> by scalping the Indians.	In the <em>Old West</em>, the colonists asserted<strong> hegemony</strong> over the Indians by killing all the bison and depriving the Indians of their much needed <em>leather</em> and <em>meat</em>.		
声		voice	The <i>samurai</i> at the top is familiar enough. The combination beneath, which looks like a <i>flag</i> with a line running through it, is not. Try to devise some way to take note of it, and pay attention to the writing.		7	2044	1896	51	セイ、ショウ	こえ、こわ-	When an enemy's <em>flag</em> is raised, a true <em>samurai</em> can <em>split</em> it in half with just his<strong> voice</strong>.	Having lost his<strong> voice</strong>, the samurai comunicated to his troops with a striped flag.	The lower element is easier to remember as: <em>venetian mask with stick</em>. Story: During carnival time you try to guess who is that <em>gentleman</em> hiding his face under <em>venetian mask with stick</em>. You definetely heard his<strong> voice</strong> before.	The <em>samurai</em> stepped on his <em>Rubik's Cube</em> and <em>bent</em> it. His <strong>voice</strong> of pain and grief rang out.	In ancient Japan, after winning a battle, a SAMURAI might rip the opposing FLAG down the middle (represented by the vertical line of flag) and bellow a victory cry in his loudest<strong> VOICE</strong>.		
眉		eyebrow	The <i>flag</i> here has an extra vertical stroke in it. Think of it as an <b>eyebrow</b> pencil stuck in the <i>eye</i>.		9	2045	2583	51	ビ、ミ	まゆ	The<strong> eyebrow</strong>s hover over the <em>eyes</em> like a <em>divided flag</em>.	Pictograph: opera glasses over eyes ビ ミ まゆ.	(+astridtops) <strong>Eyebrows</strong> are like <em>flags</em> that are raised above your <em>eyes</em>. The <em>flag</em> is divided because otherwise that would be a monobrow.	The <em>venetian mask with stick</em> covers the <em>eyes</em> but I can recognize his bushy<strong> eyebrow</strong>s above it.	She painted <em>Japanese flags</em> above her <em>eyes</em> as<strong> eyebrow</strong>s.		
呉		give	The complex of strokes in this kanji is unusual and difficult, because of the fourth stroke, which is rare (see frames 33 and 34). The <i>mouth</i> and <i>tool</i> are already familiar.		7	2046	1897	51	ゴ	く.れる、くれ	As a present, I <strong>gave</strong> my dentist a <em>hand-crank tool</em> for spreading <em>mouths</em>. He was so happy since it makes his job easier.	I see this as a pictograph of an old-style phonograph - a stand, record, crank and bell (the mouth). Even the primitives work out - a <em>tool</em> with a <em>crank</em> which plays music out of the bell <em>mouth</em>. Imaginge <strong>giving</strong> one of these old and beautiful phonographs to a classical or jazz music buff!	"This kanji does not mean ""give"" as in ""give to someone."" It means ""give"" in the sense that someone gave you something, or did something for your benefit when combined with a gerund (-te/-de form) of a verb. STORY: Your working in a factory and your hand gets stuck in one of the gears. You yell with a big MOUTH, ""HELP!"" and one of your co-workers runs over,<strong> GIVE</strong>S YOU a HAND-CRANK TOOL, and goes back to work. =(."	"Some dude is changing a flat tire. He opens his <em>mouth</em> to say, ""GIVE me that <em>tool</em>,…what was it called again? Oh yeah, a <em>tire iron</em>."" (The forth stroke looks like a tire iron to me.)."	I was going to<strong> give</strong> you a <em>hand-crank tool</em> but I eated it. :(.		
娯		recreation	Woman . . . give.		10	2047	1898	51	ゴ		A man from a less enlightened society comes for a visit, and asks the host to give him a woman for some<strong> recreation</strong>.	While at the dentist's office <em>giving</em> him his <em>hand-crank tool</em>, one of the assistant's asks me if I'd like to join her in the back for some <strong>recreation</strong>.	A <em>woman</em> <em>gives</em> up her<strong> recreation</strong> time in order to raise a family.	God gives Adam a woman for<strong> recreation</strong>al purposes…	"""Give me a woman ( <a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%A5%B3%E3%82%92%E5%91%89%E3%82%8C%EF%BC%81"">女を呉れ！</a> ) for my<strong> recreation</strong>!""."		
誤		mistake	Words . . . give.		14	2048	1899	51	ゴ	あやま.る、-あやま.る	"It is a rookie <strong>mistake</strong> to believe the <em>words</em> when your sweetie says ""You don't have to <em>give</em> me anything for my birthday."" Trust me, your sweetie wants something, something shiny, and if you disappoint, you will suffer."	You must <em>give</em> <em>words</em> of apology when you make a<strong> mistake</strong>.	"""I GIVE you my WORD that I won't make the same <strong>MISTAKE</strong> twice""."	In a debate the smallest<strong> mistake</strong> (even a slip of the tongue) makes your <em>words</em> into a <em>gift</em> to your opponent.	When the dentist makes a<strong> mistake</strong> in your <em>mouth</em> with his <em>hand-crank tool</em>, you scream out <em>words</em> of pain.		
蒸		steam	The <i>flower</i> at the top and the <i>floor</i> with the <i>oven fire</i> beneath are familiar. The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for <i>complete</i>, whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of <i>water</i>.		13	2049	1900	51	ジョウ、セイ	む.す、む.れる、む.らす	This kanji is used in compounds for the<strong> steam</strong>ing of food and also for smoking/fumigation. Here we have the Japanese once again trying to replicate the French cuisine, only with a twist,<strong> steam</strong>ing food with flowers (think of flower-smoked ham for example). Flowers must first be <em>completely soaked in water</em>, and then poured over a thin piece of <em>flooring</em> under which there is an <em>oven fire</em>.	"Note: <em>complete + water + floor</em> are later combined into 丞 <a href=""../v4/2919.html"">helping hand</a> (#2919 丞). Story: The driver of a<strong> steam</strong> train asks you for a <em>helping hand</em> and explains that your job is to throw <em>flowers</em> on the <em>fire</em> to make the<strong> steam</strong>."	(EASY KANJI!) At the top we see hot<strong> steam</strong> forming FLOWERS. At the bottom we see the STOVE FIRE heating the bottom of a pan. So what's in the middle causing all this<strong> steam</strong>? Its all COMPLETELY WATER.	I keep forgetting this primitive, so <em>completely</em>/<em>water</em> for me will be a sort of <em>water sprite</em> or elemental, a <em>child-like</em> creature <em>completely</em> made of <em>water</em>. ——– It used to be thought that to create<strong> steam</strong>, you had to trap the <em>water sprite</em> (using some sort of magical <em>flowers</em> as a lure), and place them over a thin piece of <em>flooring</em> under which there's an <em>oven fire</em>. The<strong> steam</strong> then <em>flowers</em> from the <em>water sprite</em> (re: fuaburisu).	When you want to<strong> steam</strong> some <em>flowers/vegetation</em> you don't cover them <em>completely</em> with <em>water</em>, rather you have just a little at the <em>floor</em> of the saucepan and then <em>heat</em>.		
承		acquiesce	The sense of passive acceptance or reception of information is contained in this key word. The form is based on the middle portion of the preceding character, with three additional strokes, best thought of as the kanji for <i>three</i>.		8	2050	1901	51	ショウ、ジョウ	うけたまわ.る、う.ける、ささ.げる、とど.める、たす.ける、こ.らす、つい.で、すく.う	To get someone to <em>completely</em> <strong>acquiesce</strong> it takes <em>3</em> dunks in the <em>water</em> before they give.	To get someone to<strong> acquiesce</strong>, duck them <em>completely</em> in <em>aqua</em> (=<em>water</em>) <em>three</em> times. (variation on dingomick's).	Warning, Obscene!! I finally got my girl to<strong> acquiesce</strong> to a lewd act.. But it took <em>3 times</em> to get it in <em>completely</em> and lots of <em>water</em> to clean up afterwards.	"You must ask the trapped <em>water sprite</em> not once, not twice, but <em>thrice</em> (a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's ""Kubla Khan"" comes to mind) before it will<strong> acquiesce</strong> to your requests. It's not for any mystical reasons, it's just that it hates being asked the same thing <em>three</em> times, like that character from Austin Powers."	Waterboarding: To <em>completely</em><strong> acquiesce</strong> it usually takes just <em>three</em> sessions with <em>water</em>. (Thanks to dingomick for the idea.).		
函		bin	This is the character from which the element for <i>shovel</i> derives. Within it comes the element for <i>snare</i>, with the <i>sparkler</i> surrounding it.		8	2051	1902	51	カン	はこ、い.れる	Damn racoons ill show them. I put a snare in the<strong> bin</strong> as well as a few phosphorous sparklers so as to scare the shit out of the buggers as they rummage through my<strong> bin</strong>.	(thegeezer3) Damn racoons… I'll show them. I'll put a SNARE in the<strong> BIN</strong> as well as a few SPARKLERS so as to scare the shit out of the buggers, then hit them with a SHOVEL.	A typical German apartment has five different kind of trash<strong> bin</strong>s: paper, plastic, glass, biodegradable, and everything else. Don't you dare throw your trash in the wrong<strong> bin</strong>, or else you'll find yourself on the wrong side of a booby trap: hung by a <em>snare</em>, burned by <em>sparklers</em>, and knocked out cold by a <em>shovel</em>.	(Reformatted from erikkusan) The Windows Recycle<strong> Bin</strong> is like a <em>snare</em> holding onto your trash. When you empty it, a window displays little <em>sparkles</em> as the files are <em>shoveled</em> off of your hard drive.	"This is alternative way of writing 箱 , used in e.g. 函館 (はこだて) and sometimes as is. This<strong> bin</strong> is actually a snare with a powerful sparkler in it that kills rats that enter it, the remains of which are then shoveled away (to a ""recycle<strong> bin</strong>"" perhaps)."		
極		poles	The <b>poles</b> this key word refers to are the extremities of the earth or the terminals of an electric field. The elements are: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>snare</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>crotch</i> . . . <i>floor</i>.		12	2052	1903	51	キョク、ゴク	きわ.める、きわ.まる、きわ.まり、きわ.み、き.める、-ぎ.め、き.まる	"Can simplify this using <a href=""../v4/1243.html"">decay</a> (#1243 朽). Then: The expedition to the<strong> poles</strong> is bad for your health, and the <em>decay</em> that started in your <em>mouth</em> spreads to your <em>crotch</em> – at which point you fall to the <em>floor</em>."	"(modified Katsuo) Can simplify this using <a href=""../v4/1243.html"">decay</a> (#1243 朽). You travel to the <em>poles</em>, a frozen wasteland. In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is <em>decayed</em> (see story for <a href=""../v4/1243.html"">decay</a> (#1243 朽)) so you catch no prey. The brutal cold first attacks your <em>mouth</em> as your lips turn blue, then your <em>crotch</em> also gets cold as your body fails; finally you fall to the <em>floor</em>."	Santa Claus (from the North <strong>Pole</strong>, of course), has a <em>wooden</em> sled led by reindeer <em>snared</em> at the <em>mouth</em>. One unfortunate night, he jumps down a chimney and burns his <em>crotch</em> on a piece of coal as he hits the <em>floor</em>.	The diverging magnetic fields at the<strong> poles</strong> actually attract cosmic radioactive <em>decay</em>, particularly the kind that causes cancer in the lips or the testicles. But don't worry, you can protect either your <em>mouth</em> or your <em>crotch</em> by digging a hole in the <em>ground</em> and covering it up. Which part do you protect? Imagine coming back home with cancer in the other, unprotected part.	"I remember sharing this joke on the playground back in 1986. ""Did you ear about the dumb polak who climbed a tall tree to see both<strong> poles</strong>? On the way up, stepped in his own snare, fell to the floor and ended up with his crotch in his own mouth. Then he said seeing his own crotch in his mouth… that's not the pole I wanted to see!""."		
牙		tusk	If you play with this primitive's form with pencil and paper, you will see that it begins with a <i>box</i>-like shape, and ends with the final two strokes of the <i>halberd</i>, a convenient combination for the <b>tusk</b> protruding from the mouth of an animal.	* Since this kanji has 4 strokes, you would expect that as a primitive it would also have 4 - but in fact it has 5 in the following two frames (the second stroke between divided into 2 strokes) and reverts to 4 again in frame 2056.	4	2053	1904	52	ガ、ゲ	きば、は、きばへん	The kanji looks like an elephant with<strong> tusk</strong>s. the box is the elephant's eye. The final stroke is the<strong> tusk</strong>.	He stored the<strong> tusk</strong>s into a <em>box</em>, along with the <em>broken halberds</em>.	"You can save yourself a lot of trouble because Heisig is correct on <a href=""../v4/1904.html"">tusk</a> (#1904 牙) (4), <a href=""../v4/1905.html"">bud</a> (#1905 芽) (8), <a href=""../v4/1906.html"">wicked</a> (#1906 邪) (8) but not <a href=""../v4/1907.html"">gracious</a> (#1907 雅) (5th edition says 12, but WWWJDIC says 13). So: In it's Kanji form, it has four (4) strokes, in it's primitive form (I suggest: ivory because that's what elephant<strong> tusk</strong>s are made of) it has always five (5) strokes for all Kanji in RTK1."	The <em>waitress</em> was charged by the elephant who skewered her legs with its<strong> tusk</strong>s. As a result her right leg had to be amputated (<em>missing right leg</em>), her left leg is crippled, stiff, and limp (<em>straight left leg</em>), and the<strong> tusk</strong> is still embedded in her left leg (<em>final stroke attached to waitress's crippled left leg</em>).	This actually reminds me of <em>waitress</em> more than anything, but that doesn't help much.		
芽		bud	Flowers . . . tusk.		8	2054	1905	52	ガ	め	Zoo keepers are baffled as to why the tips of the elephant's <em>tusks</em> keep <strong>budding</strong> into <em>flowers</em>.	<strong>Bud</strong>s while they're still small tend to be tusk-shaped.	An elephant places a big <em>flower</em> on the other elephant's <em>tusks</em>, to show they're best<strong> bud</strong>s.	Unfortunately, this must be a sad story. Poachers lure the elefants with <strong>buds</strong> (of <em>flowers</em>) so they can kill them to get their <em>ivory</em>.	Lets smoke some flower<strong> bud</strong> out of my tusk bong.		
邪		wicked	Tusk . . . city walls.		8	2055	1906	52	ジャ	よこし.ま	The <strong>wicked</strong> queen builds her <em>city walls</em> out of menacing <em>tusks</em>.	As everyone knows, rhinoceroses and elephants are often killed for the value of their TUSKS. Here we see a<strong> WICKED</strong> city mayor who has had countless elephants killed just to make his CITY WALLS out of TUSKS.	"The battle of Pelennor Fields (Lord of the Rings): The <em>Mumak/Oliphant</em>s are driven by their <strong>wicked</strong> riders to attack the <em>city walls</em> of Minas Tirith. It's easy to say who were the <strong>wicked</strong> ones and who were the good guys. (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EY4JYruC8"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EY4JYruC8</a>)."	You can see this is the city of the <strong>wicked</strong> just by the huge <em>tusks</em> adorning the <em>city walls</em>.	Considered a<strong> WICKED</strong> trade by most of the modern world, the TUSK trade is still often carried out in the SLUMS, outside of the influence of the police and government.		
雅		gracious	Tusk . . . an old turkey.		13	2056	1907	52	ガ	みや.び	"""Goodness<strong> gracious</strong>! Such an <strong>elegant</strong> <em>turkey with a tusk</em>."" This mnemonic is meant to join RtK's keyword with a better proposition. Heisig could have used ""<strong>elegant</strong>"" here, which is not confounded so easily with <a href=""../v4/721.html"">graceful</a> (#721 淑), and accurately represents the character's meaning (it is also the chosen keyword in Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary)."	"To not confuse it with <a href=""../v4/606.html"">grace</a> (#606 恩) or <a href=""../v4/721.html"">graceful</a> (#721 淑), think of the phrase ""Goodness<strong> gracious</strong>."" Like: ""Goodness<strong> gracious</strong>! A <em>turkey</em> with <em>tusks</em>!""."	Be<strong> gracious</strong> around the large-<em>tusked turkey</em>. They're emotional at the best of times, so don't excite them with a big weapon like that.	"""Goodness<strong> gracious</strong>!

釈		interpretation	Animal tracks . . . shakuhachi.		12	2057	1908	52	シャク、セキ	とく、す.てる、ゆる.す	"Mrs. Badger follows the <em>animal tracks</em> to the den where she finds her husband getting a <em>blowjob</em> from a fox. ""I have a good <strong>explanation</strong> for this. Really!""."	<strong>Animal track</strong> primitive: As expected, <strong>animal tracks</strong> were left in place of the trail of <em>rice</em> I'd purposely <em>drop</em>ped the night before. EDIT - also try <strong>the footprint</strong> for a primitive meaning, the classic symbol of detective films. STORY: This <em>shakuhachi</em> player is so talented, he can do<strong> interpretation</strong>s of animal noises too. They're so realistic he soon has <em>animal tracks</em> leading straight to wherever he's playing.	The magical shakuhachi can easily give explanation for any animal tracks, just like it can be used to translate words ( 訳 ).	Mrs. Badger follows the <em>animal tracks</em> to the den where she finds her husband getting <em>shakuhachi</em> from a fox. Now, I don't speak badger but judging from the screeching and the gestures, my<strong> interpretation</strong> of the situation is that Mrs. Badger is not pleased. (thanks dingomick! Just trying to use this new keyword).	An <strong>interpretive</strong> dance of some kind where somebody follows <em>animal tracks</em>, a <em>shakuhachi</em> providing the soundtrack, suggesting the tracker's thoughts and intentions.		
番		turn	This key word has been chosen for its overlay of several meanings similar to those of the kanji: a <b>turn</b> of duty, a round, a number, and so forth. Its composite elements: <i>animal tracks</i> . . . <i>rice field</i>.	* As a primitive element, we choose the image of a pair of <i>dice</i> which it is your <i>turn</i> to throw.	12	2058	1909	52	バン	つが.い	The famers take it in<strong> turn</strong>s to watch out for any animal tracks on their rice field.	(modified thegeezer3) <em>Animal tracks</em> were found in the <em>rice field</em>, now the kids of the farmer take it in<strong> turn</strong>s to keep watch and hinder the animals to make more <em>animal tracks</em> in their precious <em>rice field</em>. They roll the <em>dice</em> to decide in what order they have to keep watch and when everyones<strong> turn</strong> is.	[turn; number in a series] Ok, I'm done - now it's your <strong>turn</strong> to count the <em>drops</em> of <em>rice</em> in the <em>rice field</em>…	"I find ""turn"" alone is too generic to remember, so I add an additional keyword, <strong>numerical order</strong>. This is perhaps the most common context in which this kanji is found, e.g. 1st, 2nd = <a href=""midori://search?text=%E4%B8%80%E7%95%AA%E3%80%81%E4%BA%8C%E7%95%AA"">一番、二番</a> . Story: I see <em>animal tracks</em> leading to the <em>rice field</em> and start to worry, but then see the <strong>numerical order</strong> in which the tracks are made: 一番 mouse tracks, 二番 cat tracks, 三番 dog tracks, then 四番 lion tracks. Looks like the rice is safe."	(I use <em>animal droppings</em> instead of <em>animal tracks</em> to avoid confusion.) Story: Workers slack off in the <em>rice field</em> taking<strong> turn</strong>s at a dice game, using <em>animal droppings</em> as the dice (for lack of other implements). What game are they playing? Craps, of course.		
審		hearing	The <b>hearing</b> referred to in this character relates to trials in the courts. The elements: <i>house</i> . . . <i>dice</i>.		15	2059	1910	52	シン	つまび.らか、つぶさ.に	"At your divorce<strong> hearing</strong> the judge tells you to roll <em>dice</em> to see who keeps the <em>house</em>. (""I can't believe what I'm<strong> hearing</strong>!"" you say)."	In the court<em>house</em> the judge decides your <strong>hearing</strong> with a roll of the <em>dice</em>.	The <strong>hearing</strong> was quite informal. We had it at the judges' <em>house</em>. Each party took a <em>turn</em> relating their side of the issues, then the judge concluded the <strong>hearing</strong> with his decision.	In the <em>house</em> of law, both sides take <em>turns</em> during the<strong> hearing</strong>.	If you operate a <em>house</em> of <em>dice</em>, you can expect to end up in front of a Judge at a <strong>hearing</strong>.		
翻		flip	Dice . . . feathers.		18	2060	1911	52	ホン、ハン	ひるがえ.る、ひるがえ.す	Don't play <em>dice</em> with birds. When you're not looking, they'll<strong> flip</strong> the <em>dice</em> with their <em>feathers</em>.	When the birds out the back are playing <em>dice</em>, they<strong> flip</strong> their <em>feathers</em> (not their finger) at their opponents.	"According to my books, this<strong> flip</strong> is related to<strong> flip</strong>ping food in a frying pan or something like that. To <em>flip</em> an omelette, you need first some eggs. But you said it aloud, and when you go to the <em>field</em>, you find it empty except for some <em>animal tracks</em> and some missing <em>feathers</em>. The chickens have escaped!! <em>(music from ""Chicken Run"")</em>."	It's your <em>turn</em> to<strong> flip</strong> the chicken <em>wings</em> on grill.	These are crooked <em>dice</em>, modified using the latest robotic technology. To <strong>flip</strong> right in flight, they momentarily stick out tiny <em>feathered</em> wings to perform few deft flaps.		
藩		clan	Flowers . . . water . . . dice.		18	2061	1912	52	ハン		"This character refers to feudal<strong> clan</strong>s that were abolished in 1871 (Meiji 4) in favor of prefectures ( 廃藩置県 ), and thus were predecessors of the modern prefectures. As we know from 落 , flowers and water drops each have their own way of falling. This character says that<strong> clan</strong>s' location was decided in the way flowers, water drops and dice fall: at random. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29</a>."	In the particular<strong> clan</strong> depicted by this character, each member has to take his or her <em>turn</em> <em>watering</em> the <em>flowers</em>.	Each member of the<strong> clan</strong> has to take his <em>turn</em> at <em>water</em>ing the <em>flowers</em>. The order they do it in is decided by a roll of the <em>dice</em>. (tweaked Matthew's story).	"This yakuza<strong> clan</strong> controls the ""flower"" trade, the 'water business' ( 水商 ) and the dice gambling."	This is what members of Ku Klux<strong> Clan</strong> is doing when not meeting: pretending to live normal life by watering flowers during the day and playing dice-games with their families at night. What a double-life.		
毛		fur	This character simply reverses the direction of the final stroke of <i>hand</i> to produce <b>fur</b>. If you reverse your <i>hand</i> and put its palm down, you will have the side on which <b>fur</b> grows.		4	2062	1913	52	モウ	け	I've heard of people having hair on the back of their hands, but this is ridiculous! That's not hair, that's <strong>fur</strong>!	Be careful not to pet a cat the wrong way - most cats don't like you rubbing your <em>hand backwards</em> over their<strong> fur</strong>.	<strong>Reverse</strong> stroke of <em>hand</em> disturbs the<strong> fur</strong>.	I touch the<strong> FUR</strong> of the animals only with the reverse of my HAND . Be careful, strokes are not horizontal.	I have a lot of<strong> fur</strong> on the back of my hand.		
耗		decrease	Christmas tree . . . fur.		10	2063	1914	52	モウ、コウ、カウ		"The amount of ""fur"" (needles) on a Christmas tree<strong> decrease</strong>s, until it doesn't look all that good."	Real fur coats and real christmas trees are dereasing the last couple of years. Plasctic chrismas trees and fake fur it is nowadays.	"A marketing survey shows that there has been a<strong> decrease</strong> in Christmas trees sales. It turns out, many very stupid people confused a fir tree with a ""fur"" tree, and because ""fur is murder"" stopped buying the trees."	Christmas Tree + Fur: The<strong> decrease</strong> in the purchases of <em>furry christmas trees</em> is a result of protest from animal rights activists and nature lovers.	Sorry,<strong> decrease</strong> is too generic to remember… I bought my sister a <strong>de-creaser</strong> (a clothing maintenance device similar to an iron) after she complained about her <strong>fur coats</strong> getting all <strong>creased</strong> and wrinkled. But it was only November, so it had to sit for a while under the <strong>Christmas tree</strong> in a wrapped box waiting for someone to open it up and use it to <strong>de-crease</strong> something.		
尾		tail	Flag . . . fur.		7	2064	1915	52	ビ	お	A dog waves its furry<strong> tail</strong> like a flag.	A FLAG of FUR is a<strong> TAIL</strong>.	"I taught my dog to use the toilet. Great, right? Problem: Her<strong> tail</strong> is too long. It dips in the toilet as she tries to sit and now the <em>fur</em> smells like <em>pee</em>. Plus she splatters everyone with pee water when she wags her<strong> tail</strong>. Ew! (Note: I use ""pee"" for the flag primitive)."	Animals wave their furry<strong> tail</strong>s like flags, indicating their mood.	A <em>flag</em>-loving nationalist paints the <em>fur</em> on the<strong> tail</strong> of his <em>furry</em> dog in the colors of the national <em>flag</em>, and together they go to watch the military parade. The nationalist waves his <em>flag</em>, while the dog wags his <em>furry</em><strong> tail</strong>. 尾 (お):<strong> tail</strong>, ridge, caudal 尻尾 (しっぽ):<strong> tail</strong> (of an animal) 追尾 (ついび): following, pursuing, tracking,<strong> tail</strong>ing 尾骨 (びこつ): coccyx (tailbone) 水平尾翼 (すいへい びよく):<strong> tail</strong> plane (of an airplane).		
宅		home	House . . . lock of hair.		6	2065	1916	52	タク		"This kanji is, of course, pronounced ""taku"", and it seems the owner of this<strong> home</strong> is a little bit otaku himself. He has hung up <em>locks of hair</em> suruptitiously obtained from various females all over his <em>house</em>. A veritable hair fetishist, and certainly someone whose<strong> home</strong> you wouldn't want to visit."	"""<strong>Home</strong> is where the <em>hair</em> is""."	At<strong> home</strong>, all the drains in my <em>house</em> are clogged up with <em>locks of hair</em>.	I'm very paranoid when I finally call my <em>house</em> a<strong> home</strong>, so whenever I leave, I cut a <em>lock of hair</em>, divide it into strands, and place it at all the entrances. If one is displaced, then I know someone has been there! Saw that in a James Bond movie.	House and locks of hair (goldilocks) = goldilocks broke into the bears house and treat it like her own<strong> home</strong> the selfish bitch.		
託		consign	Words . . . lock of hair.		10	2066	1917	52	タク	かこつ.ける、かこ.つ、かこ.つける	When you<strong> consign</strong> a matter to someone, you get their word and a lock of their hair (to be used in a voodoo ritual if they don't keep their word).	"In ""The Lord of the Rings"", Galadriel<strong> consign</strong>ed a lock of her hair to Gimli the dwarf, along with some wise words."	Through <em>words</em> and a <em>lock of hair</em> the voodoo priestess<strong> consign</strong>s you to a life of pain.	"ENGLISH DEF.: give over to another for care or safekeeping; ""consign your baggage"" /// When you<strong> consign</strong> a matter to someone, you get their word and a lock of their hair (to be used in a voodoo ritual if they don't keep their word)."	"Found at a <em>consign</em>ment shop: a <em>lock of hair</em> <em>said</em> to belonging to <em>Socrates</em>. [Using<strong> consign</strong>ment shop helps to distinguish<strong> consign</strong> from <a href=""../v4/1954.html"">entrust</a> (#1954 嘱), especially if you use 'say', 'word', etc. in both stories]."		
為		do	This character rightly belongs to the previous lesson, but we held it until now because of the final element, the <i>tail feathers</i>. After the <i>drop</i> at the outset, the next three strokes are completely novel and should be given special attention.		9	2067	1918	52	イ	ため、な.る、な.す、す.る、たり、つく.る、なり	"In this kanji, you can see 3 katakana characters: ソ, ユ, and then ユ again followed by TAIL FEATHERS. STORY: ""So (ソ) you (ユ) wanna<strong> DO</strong> it?"" ""Only if you (ユ)<strong> do</strong>"" says the female bird as she raises her TAIL FEATHERS."	<strong>Do</strong> me <em>from</em> behind, says the bird, as she shakes her <em>tailfeathers</em>.	Tell a story - a reluctant magician is asked to<strong> do</strong> a trick. The audience chant 'Do it,<strong> do</strong> it!', so eventually he<strong> do</strong>es one. He takes a <em>drop</em> of water (stroke 1), drops it on the ground where it runs<strong> do</strong>wn and smears out (stroke 2). It drops<strong> do</strong>wn two steps (strokes 3 and 4) (imagine some nice setting with steps), growing and becoming multicoloured, like a petrol drop, as it goes. Then at the bottom the magician touches it with his wand and you see it has turned into a set of peacock's <em>tail feathers</em>.	"The keyword ""do"" is just too generic for me, so I use ""<strong>for the sake of</strong>"", which is perhaps a more common reading; for those familiar with the phrase ために, I believe this is the kanji for ため."

長		long	In line with the story of the preceding frame, the <i>hair</i> that needs the <i>hairpin</i> is <b>long</b>.	* The primitive of this kanji has two more shapes in addition to that of the kanji itself. Above its relative primitive, it is abbreviated form will mean <i>hair</i>. Further abbreviated,  it will mean the long, mangy <i>mane</i> of an animal.	8	2070	1920	52	チョウ	なが.い、おさ	The Geisha with<strong> long</strong> <em>hair</em> uses an ornate lacquered <em>hairpin</em> to bundle it all up.	The top of this one reminds me of the staple primitive. So here's my story: The girl's hair was so<strong> long</strong> that she had to use <em>staples</em> instead of <em>hairpins</em>. It worked, but stapling her hair to her head was kinda painful.	"As a primitive I use the image of (very)<strong> long</strong> hair. Let this kanji represent a ""Swiss Hairpin"" (similar to a Swiss army knife) : the top part being a pictogram for <em>half a comb</em>, and the lower part being the <em>hairpin</em>. Just make sure not to confuse with the kanji for ""comb"". Think of this one as a ""<em>half a comb</em>"" that can be pulled from the ""Swiss Hairpin""."	HAIRPIN: This is rather similar to that for SCARF. Both a HAIRPIN and a SCARF can be used for holding back<strong> long</strong> hair. STORY: The first 4 strokes could be a pictograph of hair blowing in the wind. It's too<strong> LONG</strong> and getting in your way, so you pin it back.	The<strong> long</strong> haired Geisha <em>staples</em> on an ornate <em>hairpin</em> so it won't slip. (Thanks to Zactacular for the idea.).		
張		lengthen	Bow . . . long.		11	2071	1921	52	チョウ	は.る、-は.り、-ば.り	The longbow is follows the design of a standard <em>bow</em>, only it has been<strong> lengthen</strong>ed.	"<em>Legolas</em> recieves spam telling him that his can <strong>lengthen</strong> his ""bow""…he smirks…he know's it's already <em>long</em> enough."	Wanna<strong> lengthen</strong> the distance you can shoot? Use a <em>longbow</em>!	In desperation, after the <em>Geisha</em> (see long) broke the string on her <em>bow</em>, she<strong> lengthen</strong>ed out one of her own hairs and strung the bow with it.	To make your <em>bow</em> into a <em>long</em>bow, just<strong> lengthen</strong> it.

髪		hair of the head	Hair . . . shape . . . friend.		14	2074	1924	52	ハツ	かみ	Japanese teenage girls consider the style of the<strong> hair of the head</strong> very important. If a particular style is trendy, soon they all want their own <em>hair</em> in the same <em>shape</em> as that of their <em>friends</em>.	<em>Friends</em> influence the <em>length</em> and <em>shape</em> of each other's <strong>hair</strong>.	When Rachel from <em>Friends</em> <em>hair</em> got popular, even <em>Mystique</em> changed her<strong> hair of the head</strong> to that style. Didn't need to cut it of course….	My daughter has <em>long</em> <strong>hair</strong> which she <em>shapes</em> in various ways depending on which <em>friend</em> she's going out with.	I put <em>Play-Doh</em> in the <em>hair</em> of my <em>friends</em>. I learned that the<strong> hair of the head</strong> does not go well with Play-Doh.		
展		unfold	Flag . . . salad . . . hairpin.		10	2075	1925	52	テン		You use an American flag to wrap up a salad for a picnic and bind it with a hairpin. Now imagine<strong> unfold</strong>ing it to open up the bounty you've fixed up for yourself.	<strong>Unfold</strong> <em>flag</em>, take out the <em>salad</em>, pin the flag down with <em>hairpins</em> and have a picnic.	You<strong> unfold</strong> the Stars and Stripes <em>flag</em> in order to hoist it high, but there's a problem! One of the stars has fallen off! With some quick thinking, you pin a <em>flower</em> to the <em>flag</em> using a <em>hairpin</em>, and you're all set. Good thing you don't have to refold the flag once<strong> unfold</strong>ed.	"The farmer girl has made some ready-to-eat salad packs, but has no way to take it to the market. She takes down the <em>flag</em>, wraps the <em>salad</em> packs and ties the bundle with her own <em>hairpin</em>. So she arrives at the market and <strong>unfolds</strong> the bundle to <strong>exhibit</strong> her goods. (Based on ""darg_sama""'s story)."	The <em>flag</em> had been used for a picnic so when I<strong> unfold</strong>ed it, bits of <em>salad</em> and <em>hairpins</em> fell out of the folds.		
喪		miss	<i>Soil</i> . . . two <i>mouths</i> . . . <i>hairpin</i>. Hint: see <i>spit</i> (Frame 162).

Here they lay, under a big <em>cross</em>, their <em>mouths</em> side by side. I stick <em>hairpins</em> in their graves. CAREFUL: the stroke order/primitive order is: ten, L mouth, R mouth, hairpin. ""Soil"" is not drawn in its stroke order."	<em>Ten</em> days ago, our <em>two mouths</em> met for the last time… then she gave me her <em>hairpin</em> as a sayounara gift. How I<strong> miss</strong> my Geisha girl…	"This kanji means<strong> miss</strong> as in ""miss a (dearly departed) person"", not as in ""miss a target"". Here the dearly departed has been buried in the ground, with her favourite hairpin in place of a gravestone, and two mourners stand around crying with open mouths."	The miner<strong> miss</strong>es his<strong> miss</strong> (his sweetheart). So much <em>soil</em> is separating his <em>mouth</em> from hers (working as a miner deep below the ground). She left him a <em>hairpin</em> as a good-luck trinket.	We tried to kiss ten times but our 2 mouths<strong> MISS</strong>ED every time. She got upset and threw her hairpin at me.		
巣		nest	Owl . . . fruit.		11	2077	1927	53	ソウ	す、す.くう	<em>Owls</em> only<strong> nest</strong> in <em>fruit trees</em>.	The wise old OWL makes her<strong> nest</strong> out of FRUIT, carving out the middle for her chicks, because then it's less work: no running back & forth to get food!	If only there had been a wise <em>owl</em> <strong>nesting</strong> in the tree of forbidden <em>fruit</em> to warn Eve about the snake.	The <em>owl</em> with the biggest <em>brain</em> will<strong> nest</strong> at the very top of a <em>tree</em>.	All the little forest creatures bring <em>fruits</em> to the <em>owl's</em><strong> nest</strong> so they don't get eaten.		
単		simple	"<i>Owl</i> . . . <i>brain</i> . . . <i>needle</i>.

For <em>owl</em>s, finding a <em>needle</em> in a <em>rice field</em> is<strong> simple</strong> (much better eyesight than us humans).	"A girl who was working at <em>Hooters</em> thought she was going to be fired because her breasts were too small. She went to an acupuncturist who convinced her that planting <em>needles</em> into her <em>brain</em> would increase the size of her breasts. Of course, all that did is she was fired and although she wasn't very smart to begin with, now she's<strong> simple</strong>-minded for life. As a primitive let this kanji be ""simple-minded blond girl"" (ex-<em>Hooters Girl</em>). Keep the image distinct from ""Hooters Girl"" (top 3 strokes)."	"Careful: <a href=""../v4/1621.html"">simplicity</a> (#1621 簡). There was an 80's pop group called ""Simple Minds"" (simple <em>brains</em>). Their most famous song was ""Don't you forget about me"" which started out with, ""Hey hey hey hey, oouuh oouuh wooah ho-ooh"", which kind of sounds like an <em>owl</em>'s ""hoo hoo"" call.

What started out as a <em>simple fiesta</em>, turned into a full-scale<strong> war</strong> after arguments about whose potato salad was the best.	So there's this fiesta in downtown Compton. It's a simple party, but someone invited people from the wrong gangs and the simple fiesta turns into an all-out turf<strong> war</strong>.	<em>Simple-minded blond girl</em> (see previous frame) is going to a <em>fiesta</em>, and boy… is this<strong> war</strong> ! She may be simple-minded but she could easily have written The Art of<strong> War</strong>. Only, the woman's version. She has just arrived at the fiesta, she has quickly apprehended the battlefield, taking note of the other competing girls who may pose a threat, and where the good looking guys are. Just watch her dividing the girls, and conquering the boys. I told you, this is<strong> war</strong> !

禅		Zen	Altar . . . simple.		13	2080	1930	53	ゼン、セン	しずか、ゆず.る	Knowing<strong> ZEN</strong>’s emphasis on “nothingness,” it’s not hard to envision a<strong> ZEN</strong> ALTAR being quite clean and SIMPLE.	"<em>Simple-minded blond girl</em> (see frame 1928) is very good at<strong> Zen</strong>, which isn't surprising since she doesn't think much. She has this bad habit of meditating perched on the main temple <em>altar</em>, which infuriates the<strong> Zen</strong> buddhists. When they get up to her and tell her rudely to step down the <em>altar</em>, she just smiles and teases them : ""Not very<strong> zen</strong> are you ?"". Who would have thought <em>simple-minded blond girl</em> would teach the<strong> Zen</strong> buddhists a lesson !"	The<strong> Zen</strong> altar is really simple.	Because<strong> Zen</strong> is so <em>simple</em>, you don't need an <em>alter</em>, just a quiet place to sit.	"Guys, if you're just going to make your story some variation of ""Zen altars are simple"", do you really need to share it publicly? There's 100 other stories saying exactly the same thing. You don't need to check the ""share this story"" box for every story you make. Don't make people wade through 100 stories that are exactly the same just to find the one that's different and works for them."

I'm switching to something <em>simpler</em>–using a<strong> bullet</strong>.	The <em>bow</em> was a weapon for <em>simple</em> times, but nowadays it has been replaced by<strong> bullet</strong>s.	Give a <em>bow</em> to <em>simple-minded blond girl</em> (see frame 1928), and she'll try to shoot<strong> bullet</strong>s with it ! When she joined this local archery club she was told she needed some equipment, and guess what she did ? She went to the grocery store and bought some<strong> bullet</strong>s.	Bows are rather simple devices compared to things that use<strong> bullet</strong>s.	<strong>Bullet</strong>s make <em>bows</em> look <em>simple</em> and obselete.

It sees so many potential <strong>animal</strong>s to eat but since it only has <em>one mouth</em>, it decides that the tasty looking <em>chihuahua</em> will be its meal for tonight. (adapted from Copycatken,1-9-2006).	"I have a strange story for this one but it works. I imagine a <em>owl</em> getting into a <em>rice field</em> which serves as a boxing ring. His opponent is a little <em>chihuahua</em>. The fight starts, the <em>owl</em> takes <em>one</em> punch to the <em>mouth</em> and is out cold. In the <em>chihuahua's</em> corner is that coach from Rocky saying ""Your an<strong> ANIMAL</strong>!!"". A vivid image of this story works pretty well for me."	The <em>owl</em> looks for its prey in the <em>rice field</em>. It sees so many potential<strong> animal</strong>s to eat but since it only has <em>one mouth</em>, it decides that the <em>dog</em> will be its meal for tonight.	An OWL in the FIELD looks for an<strong> animal</strong> for dinner, and with ONE MOUTHful consumes a CHIHUAHUA. (simplified from others).	This kanji is used for sort of monstrous beasts. Imagine a mythical<strong> animal</strong> with an <em>owl</em>'s head and a <em>dog</em>'s body. It is so large that it can devour an entire <em>rice field</em> with <em>one mouth</em>. 怪獣 【かいじゅう】 (n) monster; 獣 【けもの(P); けだもの(P); じゅう】 (n) beast; brute.		
脳		brain	<i>Part of the body</i> . . . <i>owl</i> . . . <i>villain</i>. By way of exception, the kanji for <b>brain</b> has no connection with the primitive for <i>brains</i>.		11	2084	1934	53	ノウ、ドウ	のうずる	The<strong> brain</strong> is the part of the body that can give you the wisdom of the owl… or the wickedness of the villain.	This villain is really messed up. He lets his pet owl eat various pieces of flesh from his body. Right now the owl is on his head, picking out pieces of the villain's<strong> brain</strong>.	The<strong> brain</strong> is the <em>part of the body</em> that can make you wise like an <em>owl</em> or devious like a <em>villain</em>.	While Superheroes and stupider animals rely on brawn, the <em>part of the body</em> that <em>owls</em> and diabolical <em>villains</em> rely on is their <strong>brains</strong>. I know which I like more.	Every full <em>moon</em> the <em>owl</em> swoops down on <em>villains</em>, tearing out their<strong> brain</strong>s.

He's just so smart… you never know what he'll do! Definitely enough to put you in a<strong> trouble</strong>d state of mind.	<em>Data's</em> brain quickly allerts him to the state of<strong> trouble</strong> when he see's the <em>brainy owl villain</em>.

He releases <em>owls</em> which are natural predators of the <em>villains</em>: the tribbles and the Klingons who smuggled them in.	We're all in<strong> trouble</strong> if a wise owl has a change in it's state of mind and becomes a villian.		
厳		stern	Owl . . . cliff . . . daring.		17	2086	1936	53	ゲン、ゴン	おごそ.か、きび.しい、いか.めしい、いつくし	This represents a<strong> stern</strong> looking owl, perched up on a cliff. This cliff is quite famous for daring individuals to cliff dive off of, but is any of them daring enough to threaten the owl?	( 厳しい strict;<strong> stern</strong> ) You remember of course the daring fella who had his ear pierced and went standing in front of the taskmaster. The taskmasters punishment was very<strong> stern</strong>/strict. Fella thrown of the cliff, where the owls are ready to feast. No funny guy doing that anymore.	The owl gives a<strong> stern</strong> warning to any animal that dare pass under the cliff.	"The <em>owl</em> said to Howard<strong> Stern</strong>, ""I <em>dare</em> you to jump off this cliff!""<strong> Stern</strong>, with spike in ear, accepted the dare."	The<strong> stern</strong> OWL parent throws his young off the CLIFF to test their DARING.		
鎖		chain	<i>Metal</i> . . . <i>little</i> . . . <i>shells</i>. We have saved this character until no win order to draw attention to the visual difference between the <i>owl</i> and <i>little</i>.

挙		raise	Owl . . . tool . . . hand.		10	2088	1938	53	キョ	あ.げる、あ.がる、こぞ.る	This is a special <em>owl</em>-luring <em>tool</em>. All you need is to <strong>raise</strong> it in your <em>hand</em>. <em>Owl</em> will come flying and perch on it right away.	The <em>owl</em> was asked to <strong>raise</strong> his <em>hand</em> if he needed anything, but he had a wing, not a <em>hand</em>! So he made a <em>tool</em> that looked like a <em>hand</em> which he used when he needed to <strong>raise</strong> his <em>hand</em>. For <strong>raise</strong>ing, <em>owl</em> has a <em>tool</em> <em>hand</em>.	When Harry Potter<strong> raise</strong>s his <em>hand</em>, <em>Hedwig</em> brings him a magical <em>tool</em>.	"""Does anyone know the value of <em>π</em>?"" Only the <em>owl</em><strong> raise</strong>s his <em>hand</em>."	What<strong> raise</strong>s mankind above others is the wisdom of an <em>owl</em>, the use of <em>tools</em>, and his <em>hand</em> with an opposable thumb.		
誉		reputation	Owl . . . tool . . . saying.		13	2089	1939	53	ヨ	ほま.れ、ほ.める	This <em>owl</em>'s<strong> reputation</strong> skyrocketed after he created a <em>tool</em> in order to speak human <em>words</em>.	"By <em>word</em> of mouth, <em>owl</em>-luring <em>tool</em> (<a href=""../v4/1938.html"">raise</a> (#1938 挙)) gained a <strong>reputation</strong> of amazingly effective and reliable device."	Stephen Hawking has a<strong> reputation</strong> of being as smart as an <em>owl</em> but using a <em>tool</em> to <em>speak</em>.	The wise <em>owl</em> earns its<strong> reputation</strong> not by its use of <em>tools</em> but by its famous <em>words</em>: who, who.	The <em>owl</em> is reputed to be a huge f@&%ing <em>tool</em>.		
猟		game hunting	Pack of wild dogs . . . owl . . . wind . . . cornstalk.		11	2090	1940	53	リョウ、レフ	かり、か.る	"[game-hunting; shooting; game; bag] According to unicode.org and wwwjdic, 鼡 and 鼠 (<a href=""../v4/2065.html"">mouse</a> (#2065 鼠)) are variants. So, for 鼡 (which I'll call <strong>rat</strong>) I have: an <em>owl</em>, flying in the <em>wind</em>, can easily spot a <strong>rat</strong> even if it's hiding in the <em>cornstalks</em>. Now 猟 is easy: <em>wild dogs</em> are having fun by <strong>game-hunting</strong> <em>rat</em>s."	The WILD DOGS are GAME HUNTING the OWL who flies like the WIND through the CORN STORKS.	The hunter, with his WILD DOGs to sniff out prey and his trained OWL to scout from the sky, is out<strong> game-hunting</strong> among the CORNSTALKS in a fierce WIND.	A <em>pack of wild dogs</em> chases an <em>owl</em> gliding on the <em>wind</em>, who drops <em>cornstalks</em> on them. It's hard to tell who's doing the<strong> game-hunting</strong>.	"The right side is also used in 蝋 , meaning ""wax"" (used in e.g. candle, 蝋燭 , and wax doll, 蝋人形 ). The lower right is 用 with wind instead of canopy. The true meaning of the right side is ""many gathering together"", and meaning for 蝋 comes from bee nests (bee wax). So, right side: utilization of a multitude of owls in the wind ==> multitude. Multitude of hunting dogs is used in<strong> game-hunting</strong>."		
鳥		bird	<i>Dove</i> . . . <i>one</i> . . . <i>tail feathers</i>. This is, of course, the character from which we derived the primitive meaning of <i>dove</i>. Note the lengthening of the second stroke.		11	2091	1941	53	チョウ	とり	There is only <em>one</em><strong> bird</strong> with such beautiful <em>white</em> tail feathers: the albino <em>peakcock</em>.

鳴		chirp	Mouth . . . bird.		14	2092	1942	53	メイ	な.く、な.る、な.らす	A<strong> chirp</strong> is quite simply the sound that comes from the mouth of birds.	This kanji is not limited to the<strong> chirp</strong> of a <em>bird</em>, but stands for the sound of any kind of animal. Picture a very weird bird that can imitate with its <em>mouth</em> (a bird with mouth, heh) the voice of many different animals: Meeow! Woof! Mooo! Cuack!!! (Maybe the bird has Kirby powers and obtains the abilities of the animals it eats).	"Just 100 left to go! <a href=""midori://search?text=%E9%A0%91%E5%BC%B5%E3%82%8C%EF%BC%81"">頑張れ！</a> ."

鶴		crane	<i>Turkey house</i> . . . <i>bird</i>. The first element appears on only one other occasion, back in frame 609.		21	2093	1943	53	カク	つる	"The original version of the ""Ugly Duckling"" was about a<strong> crane</strong> who grew up in a <em>turkey coop.</em> All the other <em>birds</em> made fun of it for not having a wattle or a snood or fanning its tail…"	I ordered a<strong> crane</strong> to move my <em>turkey coop</em>, but they sent me this damn <em>bird</em> instead.	Do you know how<strong> crane</strong>s came to be? Well, they used to keep the poor <em>bird</em> <em>cooped</em> all the time. But the<strong> crane</strong> really wanted to be free, so it would always streatch its head and neck out of the <em>coop</em> trying to be free.	The<strong> crane</strong> was the only <em>bird</em> allowed to sleep in the <em>coop</em> (the <em>turkey house</em>). See, the old turkeys deemed the chicken and most of the other <em>birds</em> inferior… but they wouldn't mess with a majestic<strong> crane</strong>.	During the construction of the <em>Turkey house</em>, there was a mistake and instead of ordering a metal<strong> crane</strong>, they got a <em>bird</em><strong> crane</strong>! Nonetheless, it was happy to help wherever it could.		
烏		crow	The only thing that distinguishes this character from that for <i>bird</i> is the omission of the one stroke that makes it <i>white</i>. Which is logical enough, when you consider that there are no <b>crows</b> of that color.		10	2094	1944	53	ウ、オ	からす、いずくんぞ、なんぞ	The book's story is just fine, but I found a kanji dictionary explanation also interesting: As<strong> crow</strong>s are all black, it's hard to see where their eyes are (black on black), so a stroke is removed from the part in the pictograph where the eyes would be.	A<strong> crow</strong> is a <em>bird</em>, but <em>not a white one</em>. MEANING: write <em>bird</em>, but skip writing <em>one</em> in <em>white</em>.	When God made<strong> crow</strong>s he took away their <em>whiteness</em> and gave them big <em>mouths</em> instead.	The <strong>crow</strong> is a bird with a big mouth (caw! caw!) and no white feathers to be seen.	<strong>Crow</strong>s are not white birds. brilliant.		
蔦		vine	Flower . . . bird.		14	2095	1945	53	チョウ	つた	In the jungle there is a flowery<strong> vine</strong> called hedera rhombea that attracts humming birds by the dozens. They scoot around the flowers sucking up nectar off the<strong> vine</strong>.	"Note : if you'll remember we already have a primitive for ""ivy"", but it was completely made up from the ""square jewel"" kanji. The kanji here refers to ivy, or<strong> vine</strong>, and is used in a particular compound for ""Hedera rhombea"", which is a type of ivy native to Japan. This<strong> vine</strong> here produces a lot of flowers, and attracts many small birds, which is sure to cheer up even the most depressed Japanese gardener."	It's strange that you don't often see <em>flowers</em> on <strong>vines</strong>, that's because those sneaky <em>birds</em> keep swooping in and stealing them!	"""I heard it through the grapevine"" and ""a little birdy told me"" are actually the same metaphor, linked together by a proverbial flower that's since dropped from both expressions! Or so a bird on a flower grapevine told me…"	The <em>flowery</em><strong> vine</strong> is the one that <em>birds</em> gather around.

They're both <em>birds</em> so its cool.	"A continuation of <a href=""../v4/840.html"">mountain stream</a> (#840 渓) (which happens to have the same chinese pronunciation) : the <em>husband</em> who was saved by the <em>great eagle</em> says to his wife that from now on, they will eat<strong> chicken</strong> ! No more fishing hardships and falling in the water.. just raising <em>birds</em>. Every now and then the <em>great eagle</em> comes to visit and the man offers one of his<strong> chicken</strong> to the great eagle who had saved his life."	Ever since that <em>eagle</em> attacked my <em>husband</em> from above, he acts like a <strong>chicken</strong> whenever he sees a <em>bird</em>, fearing that it might be the eagle who has come back to finish the job.	<em>Homer Simpson</em> chases after the <em>vulture</em> who stole his roasted<strong> chicken</strong> dinner.	<em>Homer Simpson</em> circles like a <em>vulture</em> around Marge when she's preparing his favourite bird,<strong> chicken</strong>.		
島		island	The <i>bird's tail</i> is tucked under here, because it has come to stop on a <i>mountain</i> to rest from its journey across the waters. Thus the kanji comes to mean an <b>island</b>.		10	2098	1948	53	トウ	しま	This<strong> island</strong> is the home of the terrible mythical bird Roc. It sits mighty atop the mountain waiting for the next hapless ship to pass by.	On the mountain of the<strong> island</strong>.. there were birds with no tail feathers.	From the <em>bird</em>'s point of view, an<strong> island</strong> is a <em>mountain</em> in the middle of water and it is very suitable for resting its tired <em>tail feathers</em>.	Tweety bird looses his tail feathers and gets stuck on a mountainous<strong> Island</strong>.	Dragon Roost <em>Island</em> (a <em>mountain</em>-based<strong> island</strong> from The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker) is where the <em>bird</em>-people (Rito) live. You could also think of Valoo perched on top of the <em>mountain</em><strong> island</strong> like a <em>bird without feathers</em>.		
暖		warmth	Unlike the character for <i>warm</i> weather learned earlier (Frame 1560), this kanji and its key word can also refer to the <b>warmth</b> of human congeniality. Its elements are: <i>sun</i> . . . <i>migrating ducks</i>.		13	2099	1949	53	ダン、ノン	あたた.か、あたた.かい、あたた.まる、あたた.める	Ducks migrate south for the winter… they follow the<strong> warmth</strong> of the sun.	A massive group of <em>migrating ducks</em> is blocking the<strong> warmth</strong> of the <em>sun</em> as they pass over your house/barbecue/picnic. Their formation is so humongous they block the<strong> warmth</strong> for a good 10 minutes while they pass over. Mnemonic for the <em>migrating ducks</em> primitive : the migrating ducks stick together like the best of <em>friends</em>, flying together <em>as one</em> (fifth stroke), they are not easy prey for the <em>great eagles / vultures</em>.	Mnemonic for migrating ducks: ducks always migrate together in pairs to protect themselves from vultures–they become friends in the process.	"This is<strong> warmth</strong> of the weather, opposite of 寒 . 温 is of things and feelings, opposite of 冷 . So darg_sama's story is just fine. For more details, see e.g. <a href=""http://utuzawa.hp.infoseek.co.jp/sannko.atatakai.htm"">http://utuzawa.hp.infoseek.co.jp/sannko.atatakai.htm</a>.

If <em>ducks migrate</em> in search of<strong> warmth</strong>, I wonder why they don't just migrate to the <em>sun</em>.		
媛		beautiful woman	Woman . . . migrating ducks.		12	2100	1950	53	エン	ひめ	You want to know about a<strong> beautiful woman</strong>? There's a <em>woman</em> that's so beautiful, the <em>birds migrate</em> to her instead of the sun!	As I saw the most<strong> beautiful woman</strong> on Earth, a flock of <em>migrating ducks</em> passed by and let their poop fly. That just ruined the moment…	Ever seen Fly Away Home? It's the true story about a girl who took in a flock of baby ducks whose parents died, and taught them how to migrate by flying an airplane over their usual migration route. I imagine this girl has become a<strong> beautiful woman</strong>, inside and out.	"Helen of Troy was known for her beauty – as the ""face that launched a thousand ships.""

Story: The <em>migrating ducks</em> left a little early this year, leaving one duck behind. He gives them the finger and says thanks ""Thanks for the <strong>support</strong>, assholes!""."	"<strong>Abet</strong>? Nobody uses that word.<strong> Abet</strong> is an onomatopoeia for when you stick your fingers down migrating ducks' throats.

[slacken; loosen; relax; lessen; be moderate; ease] The <em>thread</em> in this story is a cable line, something like a power or phone line. The <em>thread</em> was tense with all the <em>migrating ducks</em> perched on it, but got back to being <strong>slacken</strong>ed when the entire flock flew away. (darg_sama-modified,2-11-2005).	A flock of migrating ducks has been complaining that their leader is flying too fast. So they attach a thread to him, whenever they want him to<strong> slacken</strong> his pace they just give a tug on the thread.	<em>Spiderman</em> is flying a flock of <em>migrating ducks</em> as one would fly a kite, using his web lines as the <em>thread</em>. But he notices the ducks are pulling away hard, threatening to break the line. Then he remembers the advice of dear Aunt May, a noted kite freak: you've gotta<strong> slacken</strong> it. Put some <strong>slack</strong> in it!	"When <em>Daffy</em> and <em>Spiderman</em> go rock climbing, <em>Spidey</em><strong> slacken</strong>s the rope too much, so that when <em>Daffy</em> falls, he slams on the ground.

[WARNING: violent story] Two teams of <strong>insects</strong> are playing “capture the <strong>flag</strong>” (ala Unreal Tournament). All of them wear ammunition <strong>belts</strong>. Here you try to take the <strong>flag</strong> of the opponent team, when you are faced by an <strong>insect</strong>: “You’ll get our <strong>flag</strong> over my dead body!”. You reply: “All your base are<strong> BELONG</strong> to us!”, shoot him on the head, take the <strong>flag</strong> and run away. See the <strong>drop</strong> of blood flowing from his head?	This kanji is often used like this: The frog<strong> BELONG</strong>S to the amphibian species. STORY: A scientist is trying to classify all the different INSECTS in the forest to find out which species they<strong> BELONG</strong> to. He does this by going from rock to rock, tree to tree, putting a FLAG where he already went, while taking INSECT sample DROPS (small insects/beetles look like DROPS) and DROPPING them into his BELT which is rigged with little jars.

On the <em>road</em> to my <strong>interview</strong> I <em>accidentally</em> bump into <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> who gives me some good advice.	"""Interview"" is a bit of a stretch, as this means ""to meet accidentally"". The place where person accidentally met the crickety fellow was on the road somewhere.

The elements for composing it are: <i>mountain goat</i> . . . <i>moon</i> . . . <i>soil</i>.		13	2110	1960	53	ソ	でく	"A legend says that if you<strong> model</strong> a <em>mountain goat</em> (with tail and everything) from dirt and leave to the light of the moon on the <a href=""../v4/2846.html"">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔), the <em>dirt</em> will became <em>flesh</em>. (blackstockc)."	"If you<strong> model</strong> a mountain goat from ""soil"" and leave it under the full ""moon,"" it will come to life."	Think of a Chia Pet. One of the very first<strong> model</strong>s was a <em>mountain goat made entirely of soil</em>, but it wasn't stable at all. The soil would crack and dry up in sunlight, so the only way to give a soil-based Chia Pet some light was to leave it in the <em>soft glow of the full moon</em>. They were spectacular, but the clay<strong> model</strong>s soon proved to be easier to sell.	"Tip: <em>mountain goat</em> and <em>moon</em> are later combined into <a href=""../v4/2846.html"">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔)."	The <em>mountain goat</em>, who has the cow as its role<strong> model</strong>, also tried to jump over the <em>moon</em>. Unfortunately it couldn't even lift itself off the <em>ground</em>.		
遡		go upstream	Mountain goat . . . moon . . . road.		14	2111	2847	53	ソ、サク	さかのぼ.る	On the <em>first day of the month</em>, all the salmon<strong> go upstream</strong>, up the <em>road</em>, to the mating grounds.	You accidentally ran over and killed the holy <em>mountain goat</em> on the <em>road</em>. Frightened by the view of the dead <em>body</em> and to save your own <em>body</em> from the angry villagers, you decide to run away from your bloodstained vehicle, jump into the river, and <strong>go upstream</strong> to hide your tracks.	You decide to go salmon fishing, so you ride a <em>mountain goat</em> to the top of the <em>road</em>. Under the light of the <em>moon</em>, as it's illegal, you catch the salmon <strong>going upstream</strong>.	In this kanji we see a <em>mountain goat</em> that decided to<strong> go upstream</strong> along a <em>road</em>, but for some reason it will only<strong> go upstream</strong> when the full <em>moon</em> is up. It's actually stubborn like a <em>mountain goat</em> about not going upstream along the <em>road</em> at any other period of time. The <em>road</em> itself is also very confused about this.	On the <em>first day of the month</em> the <em>road</em> to<strong> go upstream</strong> is opened for salmon fisherman.		
岡		Mount	"Here we see a  <i>mountain goat</i> ""<b>mounted</b>"" under a <i>glass canopy</i>. In this and the following frames, think of a particular <b>Mount</b> you know."		8	2112	1961	53	コウ	おか	White<strong> mount</strong> , Fuji<strong> mount</strong> , olympus<strong> mount</strong> whatever ….The choice is yours but wherever you go they sell those snowglobe souvenir : under a GLASS HOOD you can see the<strong> mount</strong> with a MOUTAIN GOAT standing on top of it …. So kitsch you just can't forget it .	Note: Stroke order is belt..horns..mountain, not the same as <em>mountain goat</em>.	"This has the same meaning as 丘 , so my ""Mount"" is a hill with<strong> mount</strong>ain goats on it under a glass canopy. It's obviously an effort by the locals to add some<strong> Mount</strong> atmosphere to their hill. As a primitive, it has the meaning ""sturdy"" (really), which Heisig has not used for some reason, but I will. The glass canopy must be pretty sturdy to keep the goats inside (bulletproof glass, I'm sure)."	Goat + belt = <em>S&amp;M goat</em>. Don't think too much on the image or you'll regret it forever. The goat loves the <strong>mount</strong> and it also loves to <strong>mount</strong>.	My<strong> Mount</strong> is the<strong> Mount</strong> in Dun Morogh where the dwarven capital of Ironforge nestles inside. At the gates to Ironforge you see a bronze<strong> mount</strong>ain goat guarding the entrance, in glass canopy for visitors to watch. This particular goat is the first goat of king Magni Bronzebeard.		
鋼		steel	Metal . . . Mount.		16	2113	1962	53	コウ	はがね	<em>Mount</em> Fuji is completely made up of a <em>metal</em> known as<strong> steel</strong>.	Sturdy metal is obviously<strong> steel</strong> (see previous frame).	On the trail up <em>Mount Fuji</em>, the curators have put up <em>metal</em> railings for safety in some of the otherwise hazardous parts of the climb. The particular metal they used was stainless <em>steel</em>, so that it wouldn't rust in the rain and snow.	<strong>Steel</strong> is the METAL forged in the fires of MOUNT DOOM.	A giant<strong> steel</strong> Mecha-Godzilla, made entirely of <em>metal</em> climbs atop <em>Mt. Fuji</em> and lets out a furious roar.		
綱		hawser	Thread . . . Mount.		14	2114	1963	53	コウ	つな	<em>Spiderman</em> saves Japan from floating away by tying <em>Mt. Fuji</em> to mainland Asia using a<strong> hawser</strong> made of web.	A sturdy thread is equally obviously<strong> hawser</strong> (heavy rope). (see previous frame).	Easy. In order to climb Mount Fuji you're going to need a strong type of thread, a<strong> hawser</strong> (heavy rope).	After <em>Spiderman</em> landed his ship in Japan and used his webbing as a<strong> hawser</strong> to tie the boat to the dock, he looked p and caught his first glimpse of the majestic <em>Mt. Fuji</em>.	Using a <em>thread</em> to climb that <em>Mount</em>. isn't a good idea, you need a<strong> hawser</strong>.		
剛		sturdy	Mount . . . saber.		10	2115	1964	53	ゴウ		Mount everest is very<strong> sturdy</strong>, you can hit it all day with a saber and it wont even wobble.	Anything<strong> sturdy</strong> in Japan is associated with <em>Mount</em> Fuji. Perhaps this is because it's symmetry is believed to make it rather<strong> sturdy</strong> itself, unlike all those crooked mountains that are around and tend to fall apart (think rock slides, avalanches, etc.). Here we see<strong> Sturdy</strong>-brand <em>sabers</em> with <em>Mount</em> Fuji engraved on the blade.	This is the full character for<strong> sturdy</strong>, to which saber is added as an example of a<strong> sturdy</strong> thing. (the true etymology of 岡鋼綱剛 is a bit more messy, but I don't really care, this way it's easy to remember, and isn't far from the truth anyway).	Remember the sword in the stone. This is the <em>saber</em> in the top of <em>Mt —</em>. It's so<strong> sturdy</strong> almost no one can pull it out.	The most<strong> sturdy</strong> <em>sabers</em> are made on<strong> sturdy</strong> <em>Mount</em> Fuji.		
缶		tin can	Though the meaning has no reference to animals, the parts do: <i>horse</i> with a <i>mountain</i> underneath.		6	2116	1965	53	カン	かま	Horses kept in the mountains have a unique savory taste. At least so the text on this<strong> tin can</strong> would have us believe, which contains 100% authentic mountain horse.	The starving <em>horse</em>, stranded on the <em>mountain</em>, is forced to eat a tasty<strong> tin can</strong>.	Hint: pictograph of a <em>horse</em> standing in a <em>tin can</em>. No need for mountain.	Mountains can be pretty rough on horses' hooves so it might help to put<strong> tin can</strong>s on each hoof as an extra horseshoe.	By <em>noon,</em> the <em>mountain</em> is covered with <em>tin cans</em>.		
陶		pottery	Pinnacle . . . bound up . . . tin can.		11	2117	1966	53	トウ		At <em>The Pinnacle</em>, traditional<strong> pottery</strong> is done by <em>binding</em> up a bunch of <em>tin cans</em> into whatever pot shape desired.	In order the get clay up to the <em>Acropolis</em> for the<strong> pottery</strong> class, clay is packed into <em>tin cans</em>, <em>bound</em> in huge loads, and lugged up there by some unfortunate soul.	<strong>Pottery</strong> is an obsolete art up in the super-modern Utopia of <em>The Pinnacle</em> … instead, they <em>bind up</em> everything they need to preserve in high-tech <em>tin cans</em>.	At <em>The Pinnacle</em> they refuse to use <em>tin cans</em> and so they have been <em>bound up</em>, they will only use<strong> pottery</strong>.	This chinese man was making the best china<strong> pottery</strong> in all of … China. For some reason he insisted on working at the top of a <em>pinnacle</em>, away from the distractions of the world. He kept in touch with the local people, and took orders, through <em>bound tin cans</em> (tin cans bound with rope, the children's version of the telephone).		
揺		swing	Fingers . . . condor.		12	2118	1967	53	ヨウ	ゆ.れる、ゆ.る、ゆ.らぐ、ゆ.るぐ、ゆ.する、ゆ.さぶる、ゆ.すぶる、うご.く	For the <em>condor</em> primitive: A <strong>condor</strong> is like a <em>vulture</em>, but <em>twice</em> as big and it lives near <em>mountains</em> (a suitable place for such a majestic bird). For<strong> swing</strong>: I'm sitting on a<strong> swing</strong> when a <em>condor</em> comes by and picks up the whole<strong> swing</strong> set with its big <em>finger</em>-like claws and now I'm<strong> swing</strong>ing in mid-air. Weeeeeeeee!!!!!	I keep<strong> swing</strong>ing gleefuly on the talons of the <em>soaring condor</em> until he slices off my <em>fingers</em> and sends me plummeting.	I don't recommend using king as a primitive for condor, the stroke order is wrong. Vulture Dry Mountain or even Vulture Two Mountains should work better.	This kanji is for <strong>tremors</strong> and <strong>shakes</strong>. It perfectly illustrates the good ol' joke of <strong>shaking</strong> a beverage <em>tin can</em> in your <em>fingers</em>. And then laugh when another person opens the can with his/her <em>nails</em> (claws) and gets totally soaked! (<em>Tin can</em> loses the left stroke because it has no pull tab).	"I am sure you have heard this on the trains in Japan: <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%8C%E3%81%93%E3%82%8C%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E6%8F%BA%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%81%AE%E3%81%A7%E3%80%81%E3%81%94%E6%B3%A8%E6%84%8F%E3%81%8F%E3%81%A0%E3%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%80%8D"">「これから揺れますので、ご注意ください」</a> So imagine that the train does<strong> SWING</strong> and SHAKE.

謡		Noh chanting	Words . . . condor.		16	2119	1968	53	ヨウ	うた.い、うた.う	"<strong>Noh chanting</strong>?!? I meant ""NO CHANTING!"" Now all you, just shut up! Not another <em>word</em>! Don't you know that chanting can provoke attacks from the local <em>condor</em>? So, no chanting, and especially no <strong>Noh chanting</strong>."	Picture guy dressed in a condor mask up on stage during Noh performance chanting some words nobody understands.	In the Andes flies the mythical<strong> Noh Chanting</strong> condor. You can barely spot this king of birds high up in the sky yet you hear its chanting words flow down to the ground.	<strong>Noh chanting</strong> is simply <em>words</em> which sound like that a <em>vulture</em> would make.	<strong>noh chanters</strong> chant their <em>words</em> in masks that look like <em>condors</em> (condor = the vulture king of the mountain.).		
鬱		gloom	"Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from <i>melancholy</i> (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material <i>depression</i> we met in Frame 1421). The picture of <b>gloom</b> begins with a small <i>grove</i> of trees, under which we see a <i>crown</i> made out of used <i>tin cans</i>. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of <i>Remembering the Kanji</i>. It is composed of a <i>shovel</i> with a <i>sheaf</i> dotted with small <i>drops</i> on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop <i>shovel</i> attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ ""Bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>, bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>..."" ♪ The <i>drops</i> represent the chaff flying about as the <i>sheaves</i> are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is <i>someone sitting on the ground</i> alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your <i>tin-can crown</i>. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the <i>grove</i>, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-<i>shaping</i> of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of <b>gloom</b> down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations."		29	2120	3030	53	ウツ	うっ.する、 しげ.る、 ふさ.ぐ	I'm depressed that this kanji has 29 strokes.	"In the middle of the GROVE you find a TIN CAN. There's a CROWN inside! You are very excited with your finding, but then a figure appears behind you: ""Hey, gimme that kid!""

就		concerning	<i>Capital</i> . . . <i>chihuahua</i> with a <i>human leg</i> in place of one of its paws.		12	2121	1969	53	シュウ、ジュ	つ.く、つ.ける	In the <em>capital</em> they have been having hearings<strong> concerning</strong> bioethics and bioengineering they call as their first witness a <em>chihuahua</em> with <em>one human leg</em>.

"Note: <a href=""../v4/2087.html"">understandably</a> (#2087 尤) In the capital, there are hearings<strong> concerning</strong> bioengineering.

I WOULD BE VERY MUCH AFRAID. YES.	In<strong> Concerning</strong> Hobbits, Tolkien writes about Hobbiton, which is sort of the <em>capital</em> of the Shire. Understandably, they keep chihuahuas as dogs, and one of them has a human leg. Magic, probably.

懇		sociable	Skunk . . . silver . . . heart.		17	2123	1970	53	コン	ねんご.ろ	"The skunk here is Pepe LePew of Looney Tunes fame. He's a very<strong> sociable</strong> skunk, as far as skunks go, but instead of having a ""heart of gold"" he has a heart of silver (since he always finishes second in the game of love)."	"The skunk here is Pepe LePew of Looney Tunes fame. He's a very<strong> sociable</strong> skunk, as far as skunks go, but instead of having a ""heart of gold"" he has a heart of silver."	(コン) Skunk and silver appear together in a few kanji so I combined them to make a <em>silver skunk</em> character. This skunk, due to a random fluke, is not black and white, but actually silver colored. Which means this skunk can pass, say for, a cat (aka Over the Hedge). When the skunk realized the odd coloring wasn't a curse but actually a blessing, it realized in it's <em>heart </em>that it could be<strong> sociable</strong> with all sorts of animals that normally would run away from smelly skunks.	The skunk is very<strong> sociable</strong> at the party, telling everyone all about his <em>silver</em> <em>heart</em>. // Primitive: top left: <em>skunk</em> = a skunk <em>clawing</em> at a <em>sow</em>. The 3rd claw gets broken.	I'm using the top of the kanji as a lawyer: The lawyer is nothing but a skunk dressed in a silver suit. Also lawyers have no heart, they only fake it to be<strong> sociable</strong>.		
墾		groundbreaking	The <b>groundbreaking</b> referred to here is not for the erection of new buildings but for the opening of farmlands.

It was a famous <em>skunk</em>, the one with the familiar <em>silver</em> stripe. The feet of the crowd rushing from the ceremony site churned up the <em>soil</em> very nicely. The ceremony was ruined but the <strong>groundbreaking</strong> was a great success.	I got sprayed by a skunk, so no one is helping me with the<strong> groundbreaking</strong> of my farm.

"(コン) The <a href=""../v4/1970.html"">sociable</a> (#1970 懇) <em>silver skunk</em> might not look like a skunk, but when it lets it smell fly, it's so bad it actually leaves craters.

(Because of that, and the smell of course).	"He counters, ""Your <em>legs</em> are so <em>white</em>, all I would have to do is apply some black and they would be the perfect<strong> countenance</strong> of a <em>skunk</em>!""."	The shocked<strong> countenance</strong> on girl's face when Pepe started to hump her white legs.	Anyone who watched a looney tunes cartoon know those kind of scene : pepe embraces a poor kitty mistaken for a SKUNK and the smell of pepe make the unfortunate girl loose all<strong> countenance</strong> : she turns WHITE then runs as fast as her LEGS can carry her . So much for cat s dignity and<strong> countenance</strong>.	<em>Pepe LePew's</em><strong> countenance</strong> isn't so bad; it's the smell that makes everyone turn <em>white</em> and dash off on their <em>human legs</em>!		
免		excuse	This character is used for <b>excusing</b> oneself for a failure of courtesy. The elements are: <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>sun</i> (oddly enough, laid on its side) . . . <i>human legs</i>.	* For the primitive meaning, we shall refer to this character as a <i>rabbit</i>, for which the old form of the character is 兔.	8	2126	1972	53	メン	まぬか.れる、まぬが.れる	"Obviously this is the rabbit from Alice, excusing himself and rushing away on his legs, as he has a binding day schedule. This is at the same time an image, with bound=ears, day=head and legs are just legs. The image is used in <a href=""../v4/2093.html"">rabbit</a> (#2093 兎)."	What is the rabbit's<strong> excuse</strong> for being such a jerk? Well he was b<em>ound up for a whole day</em> while being stepped on by peoples <em>human legs</em> in some make-up labratory. Yeah I think I can<strong> excuse</strong> him after knowing that.	''<strong>Excuse</strong> me.'' Jessica <strong>Rabbit</strong> walks past you, <em>bound up</em> in a red sequinned dress in which her voluptuous <em>tatas</em> are sublimely complemented by her long <em>legs</em>.

逸		elude	Rabbit . . . road.		11	2127	1973	53	イツ	そ.れる、そ.らす、はぐ.れる	Tip : as a primitive <em>rabbit</em> becomes Bugs Bunny of Looney Tunes fame. Here <em>Bugs Bunny</em><strong> elude</strong>s Elmer Fudd the hunter, once again.	<em>Bugs Bunny</em><strong> elude</strong>s Elmer Fudd by pretending to be <em>road</em>kill.	Word play to differentiate<strong> elude</strong>/evade:<strong> elude</strong> ~= e-lewd. Alice is following Mr. <em>Rabbit</em> on the <em>road</em>. Mr. Rabbit flashes her in a lewd way and disappears, completely <strong>eluding</strong> her.	A <em>rabbit</em> on the <em>road</em> has a hard time <strong>eluding</strong> cars.			
晩		nightfall	Sun . . . rabbit.		12	2128	1974	53	バン		At<strong> nightfall</strong> the <em>sun excuses</em> itself and goes to sleep.	"This is EASY!!! Japanese people see a RABBIT ON THE MOON (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rabbit"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rabbit</a> ) and so<strong> nightfall</strong> is when the <em>sun</em> leaves to make way for the <em>rabbit</em>."	"Imagine <em>Bugs Bunny</em> halfway sticking out of a <em>rabbit</em> hole, somewhere in Japan, taking in the <em>sun</em>, when all of a sudden, night falls. Our ""<em>sun-loving rabbit</em>"" burrows his way into the earth and pops out on the other side of the planet (say somewhere in America) and there it is, the <em>sun</em> high and bright in the sky! Thus, whenever it is<strong> nightfall</strong> you can be sure our ""<em>sun-loving rabbit</em>"" is taking in the <em>sun</em> somewhere else accross the globe."	"<em>Bugs Bunny</em> watches the <em>sun</em> go down at<strong> nightfall</strong>. ""Eeeeh…That's all folks!""."	Mr. <em>Rabbit</em> watches the <em>sun</em> go down.<strong> Nightfall</strong> is coming and he hasn't made it to the queen's yet!

It must be because he's always EXERTING himself on the run from Elmer Fudd (or from kicking the shit out of Elmer Fudd when he catches up!!).	Hint: Energizer bunny.	The energizer bunny's<strong> exertion</strong> of power keeps going and going…	<em>Bugs Bunny</em> spares himself the <strong>exertion</strong> of <em>muscle</em> power. Instead, he <strong>studies</strong> and tricks Fudd every time.	The <em>trix rabbit's</em> latest scheme to get the trix: Dress up with fake <em>muscles</em> like a body builder and amaze the kids as he lifts dumbbells. He accidentally uses real dumbbells though, and despite all his<strong> exertion</strong>, the kids discover his disguise. Geez, he really <strong>exerts</strong> himself in all these weird schemes… you'd think it would just be easier to go to the store and buy a box.		
象		elephant	"A <i>rabbit</i>'s head with the body of a <i>sow</i> represents an <b>elephant</b>.

With huge <em>rabbit</em> ears, and a body fat like a <em>pig</em>, the<strong> elephant</strong> has an <strong>image</strong> problem for sure (しょう)! NOTE: This kanji also means 'image'.	See book.	An<strong> elephant</strong> has the head and ears of a <em>hare</em> and the body of a <em>pig</em>, at least in proportion.

Mr. T is shocke of this bizarre<strong> statue</strong> of an elephant with rabbits floppy ears and the tails of a sow. I pity da fool who made this bullshit<strong> statue</strong>. What is it supposed to look like?	<em>Haruhi</em> made a<strong> statue</strong> of her riding an <em>elephant</em> for Indian people to worship.	The famous hachiko<strong> statue</strong> ( ハチ公像 ) has been replaced by a<strong> statue</strong> of <em>[insert your person here]</em> riding an <em>elephant</em> causing the outrage of millions of japanese.		
馬		horse	Let the extra vertical stroke in the <i>mane</i> combine with the first vertical stroke to give an image of the <b>horse's</b> long neck. The only odd thing is the <i>tail feathers</i> at the end, but that should present a good image to remember the character by. The fact that the last stroke of <i>mane</i> and the first of <i>tail feathers</i> coincide should no longer surprise you.	* As a primitive, this kanji will mean a <i>team of horses</i> as distinct from the single <i>horse</i> whose primitive we met earlier.	10	2132	1978	54	バ	うま、うま-、ま	"Turkey with the drops at the top removed and tail feathers added (this matches stroke order and there are the tail feathers already, why not have the whole bird). If you take the two drops of 隹 as wings, then<strong> horse</strong>s are like turkeys, but have no wings and have more prominent tail ""feathers"". Both are actually supposed to be pictographs, though."	<strong>FINALLY!! Geeeeeeeeeez!!!</strong>.	"The top part is <em>half a comb</em> (see frame 1920) with an extra vertical stroke to account for a sturdier version used to comb a<strong> horse</strong> mane. As a primitive I used the theme of the <em>Trojan<strong> Horse</strong></em>. Not the modern computer viruses, but the large wooden<strong> horse</strong> which led to the demise of Troy and of the Trojans. Either its size (much greater than a live<strong> horse</strong>), or the fact that it conceals things into its belly, will set it appart from the <em>horse</em> primitive that came in frame 568 (""noon"")."	4 dots = 4 limbs, the hook = tail, top part = manes.	This kanji needs no mnemonic, really. It's used often enough as a primitive that you would have to have Alzheimer's to forget it. If you write each kanji once, as Heisig recommends, then the stroke order will also come naturally.		
駒		pony	<i>Team of horses</i> . . . <i>phrase</i>. In American slang, a <b>pony</b> is an underground translation of a classical text, which students who cannot manage the difficult <i>phrases</i> of the original language consult and pass on from one generation to the next.		15	2133	1979	54	ク	こま	The cute little innocent-looking plastic <strong>pony</strong> on the desk of a student is in fact a <em>trojan horse</em>, hiding <em>phrases</em> in its belly which are used for cheating during an exam. No <strong>pony</strong> will be permitted on desks during tests!	"A particular My Little<strong> Pony</strong> has a string that when you pull it, it repeats the same dumb phrase like ""I love you""."	A phrase used to insult horses - is<strong> pony</strong>. They hate that.	"Lisa Simpson often utters the <em>phrase</em> ""Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>? Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>? Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>?"". Finally Marge snaps ""No, not until you're older!"" ""But mum, it will be a <em>horse</em> by then.""."	"The<strong> Pony</strong> Express was a quick mail delivery service in old America. It actually used horses, not ponies, but the <em>phrase</em> ""Pony Express"" sounded better than ""Horse Express"", and so they chose the better-sounding phrase as a marketing gimmick."		
験		verification	Team of horses . . . awl.		18	2134	1980	54	ケン、ゲン	あかし、しるし、ため.す、ためし	We just <strong>verification</strong> that there are indeed no soldiers in the belly of this trojan <em>horse</em>. We're just gonna stab it in the belly with this <em>awl</em> to check.	The<strong> verification</strong> proves the horse is real by poking it with an ice pick.	Here we have a French <em>trojan horse</em> undergoing<strong> verification</strong> by the British police, or immigration, or other authority. The British police are punching into the <em>trojan horse</em> 's sides with an<em>awl</em>, to try and find if it is concealing people. Of course they aren't going to find much by using an <em>awl</em> for that purpose (the <em>awl</em> having such a short tip), but the sillyness of it should be enough to remember it.	Verify the horse is genuine by poking it with an awl.	They finally came up with a <strong>verification</strong> system to make sure that giant wooden horses weren't <em>trojan horses</em>. <em>Frankenstein</em> comes up and slaps the hell out of the side of each wooden horse. If it's hollow and soldiers are discovered inside, the <strong>verification</strong> process is complete and the <em>trojan horse</em> is destroyed before it's brought into the city.		
騎		equestrian	Team of horses . . . strange.		18	2135	1981	54	キ		If the<strong> equestrian</strong> team used <em>trojan horses</em>, it would be really <em>strange</em>.	<strong>Equestrian</strong> events are where you get horses to do strange things.	<strong>Equestrian</strong> is a <em>strange</em> word that just means <em>horses</em>.	I always thought it was STRANGE that<strong> EQUESTRIAN</strong> was in the Olympics. Why don't we give the HORSES medals? They do all the work.	The St Bernard with his mouth nailed shut is ready to participate in the equesterian race. But he is sitting on a Torjan horse that wont budge.		
駐		parking	Team of horses . . . candlestick.		15	2136	1982	54	チュウ		<strong>Parking</strong> in the dark may be difficult…specially if you're<strong> parking</strong> a <em>trojan horse</em>. To lend you a tiny bit of help, take this <em>candlestick</em> with you, and at least you'll have some light.	In the olden days<strong> parking</strong> lots used to have reserved spaces for where the <em>lord</em> (of the set of houses, shops, whatever) could park his <em>team of horses</em>. nowadays it's pretty much the same…reserved<strong> parking</strong> in front for the big bosses' cars….	"(Heard inside the belly of the trojan horse) ""But the sign says No <em>Trojan Horse</em><strong> Parking</strong>, m'<em>lord</em> ."" (Think monty python skit)."	A <em>lord</em> gets valet<strong> parking</strong> for his <em>horse</em>.	In the olden days you had to park your <em>horse</em> next to a <em>candlestick</em>, a primitive<strong> parking</strong> meter that you start by lighting a fire and tracks the time by burning down.

駅		station	Team of horses . . . shakuhachi.		14	2138	1984	54	エキ		Anyone living in Japan knows that train<strong> station</strong>s play little melodies when the train is about to arrive. In Ye Olden Days, when <em>horses</em> and carriages were used for transport, the carriage driver would play a little melody on his <em>shakuhachi</em> to let the passengers know the carriage was arriving at the next<strong> station</strong>.	This reminds me of those infamous Mexican porn movies in which shakuhachi is performed on a horse. Here the deed is being done at a train<strong> station</strong>. As the passengers get off, so does the horse.	I got off at the<strong> station</strong> and saw a <em>trojan horse</em> getting a <em>shakuhachi</em> (blowjob).	In this train line the wagons are <em>trojan horses</em> and at each<strong> station</strong> the driver plays a little melody on his <em>shakuhachi</em> to let the passengers know they arrived at the next<strong> station</strong>. [thanks rtkrtk].	A homeless horse playing the flute at the<strong> station</strong> to make a dime.		
騒		boisterous	Team of horses . . . crotch . . . insect.		18	2139	1985	54	ソウ	さわ.ぐ、うれい、さわ.がしい	The hidden Greeks inside the <em>Trojan Horse</em> are getting<strong> boisterous</strong> as one of them is bitten in the <em>crotch</em> by a nasty <em>insect</em>. If they don't shut up, the Trojans will hear them…	Or more precisely: the team of horses are getting<strong> boisterous</strong> because one of them got bitten in the crotch by a horse fly. The kanji also means to roar, make up noise, to kick up a fuss and to make merry. Perhaps it is exactly the etymology behind this kanji.	My <em>horse</em> was<strong> boisterous</strong> because of nasty <em>bugs</em> in his <em>crotch</em>.	When a man is hung like a horse his love life often becomes so<strong> boisterous</strong> that he gets crabs (crotch insects).	You'd be<strong> boisterous</strong> too if you had a <em>horse</em>-sized <em>bug</em> up your <em>crotch</em>!

The Trojans stood in <em>awe</em> of the magnificent Trojan Horse that they thought was a gift. But imagine their <strong>surprise (wonder)</strong> when a bunch of Greeks came rushing out of it! (To further cement the connection between the primitives, if needed: It's a<strong> wonder</strong> that the Trojans managed to speak <em>keigo</em> 敬語 even then, saying "" わたくしたちを殺さないでください !! お願い致します !!"")."	The horse<strong> wonder</strong>s why it is being addressed in keigo 敬語 after all it is only a horse.	A lowly farmer is staring in<strong> wonder</strong> at a prince and a team of horses who has appeared before him, and uses the flowery phrases beaten into him by a taskmaster ( 敬語 , honorifics) to avoid being beheaded for rudeness.

篤		fervent	Bamboo . . . team of horses.		16	2142	1988	54	トク	あつ.い	A<strong> fervent</strong> horse doesnt need to be whipped with a bamboo stick during a race, it will go fast by itself.	A<strong> fervent</strong> history otaku rebuild the the <em>Trojan Horse</em>. But since he was Japanese, he used <em>bamboo</em> instead of normal wood.	"The <strong>fervent</strong> soldiers used <em>bamboo</em> <strong>for vents</strong> to breathe while crammed inside the <em>Trojan horse</em>. —— Using punnery to avoid confusing with <a href=""../v4/814.html"">ardent</a> (#814 烈)."	"Careful: <a href=""../v4/814.html"">ardent</a> (#814 烈). According to WWWJDIC <a href=""../v4/814.html"">ardent</a> (#814 烈) seems to emphasize a fanatical or violent aspect, while<strong> fervent</strong> is more deep, serious, or kind. Story: the<strong> fervent</strong> believer in healthy vegetarian food would only feed his <em>horses</em> the finest <em>bamboo</em> shoots."	Imagine a guy in a horse race, the gates go down and all the horses start galloping… except for this one guy, who is sitting on a <em>trojan horse</em>, hitting it<strong> fervent</strong>ly with a <em>bamboo</em> stick but it just wont move.		
罵		insult	Eyeball . . . team of horses.		15	2143	2699	54	バ	ののし.る	In ancient Japan, the most grievous<strong> insult</strong> was to poke a rival's <em>horse</em> in the <em>eye</em> (consider how rare an expensive a steed was in those days). It was the final step in preparation for a duel to the death.	This time the Trojans take one look at the <em>Trojan horse</em> and say 'ha! the <em>eyes are wonky</em>.' They throw<strong> insult</strong> after<strong> insult</strong> at it until a voice from within is heard saying 'we tried our best!'.

虎		tiger	The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the <i>magic wand</i>) who decided to make a <b>tiger</b>. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (<i>diced</i> into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated <b><i>tiger</i></b> promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless <i>human legs</i>). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for <i>zoo</i>.	* As a primitive element itself, the <i>human legs</i> are also swallowed up, but the meaning of <i>tiger</i> is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the <i>tiger</i> something else to eat.	8	2145	1990	54	コ	とら	Magic wand + first two strokes of pelt ( 皮 ) + diced + human legs. A wizard who turns people he doesn't like into newts with his magic wand goes for variety - he has always wanted a<strong> tiger</strong> pelt - but things go awry when the<strong> tiger</strong> promptly dices and eats him, leaving only a pair of legs. (a fitting end for a wicked wizard).	"<strong>Tigger, the<strong> tiger</strong></strong>, (from Pooh stories) is happy to have found a <em>magic wand</em>. Using it he can bounce up to a the top of a <em>cliff</em>, <em>seven</em> times as high as some <em>human legs</em> could bounce. <strong>Tigger</strong> thinks ""Its great to be a <strong>tiger</strong>!"	The 7 very smart magicians were standing on top of a cliff. The 7 very smart magicians wanted to create a<strong> tiger</strong>. The smart<strong> tiger</strong> ate 6 and a half magicians, leaving a pair of human legs as a snack for later. The smart<strong> tiger</strong> hang the pair of human legs on a tiny hook, so that no other predator could reach it. Moral of the story:<strong> tiger</strong> wins.	This kanji is symbolic of the<strong> tiger</strong> Hobbes: he's sort of magical, a toy come to life, hence the <em>magic wand</em>; he and Calvin are always riding their go-cart off the kicker (hence the little hook) at the edge of the <em>cliff</em>; Hobbes and Calvin are both about <em>seven</em> years old; and Hobbes often walks and stands as though he has <em>human legs</em>. 虎 (とら) :<strong> tiger</strong>.	The magic wand on top of the cliff spawned 7<strong> tiger</strong>s that ate human legs.		
虜		captive	Tiger . . . man.		13	2146	1991	54	リョ、ロ	とりこ、とりく	<strong>Captive</strong> <em>men</em> are thrown to the tigers. I think you can imagine something else is done to<strong> captive</strong> women…	"Tip: To avoid confusing keyword <em>captive</em> with <a href=""../v4/1018.html"">captured</a> (#1018 囚) note that cap<em>ti</em>ve contains ""<em>ti</em>"" for <em>ti</em>ger."	<strong>Captive</strong> <em>men</em> are thrown to the <em>tigers</em>.<strong> Captive</strong> women are thrown to the <em>men</em>. (thanks, Piitaa).	"The<strong> CAPTIVE</strong> men in the movie ""Gladiator"" were forced to fight TIGERS in a Gladiator Arena."	A capitive <em>tiger</em> in San Francisco leaps out of his pen and kills a <em>man</em> and attacks two others.		
膚		skin	Tiger . . . stomach.		15	2147	1992	54	フ	はだ	Ending up in a tiger's stomach is not good for your<strong> skin</strong>, as it's full of stomach acids.	TIGGER only has visible<strong> SKIN</strong> on his STOMACH. The rest of his body is covered in orange fur.	"They say, ""there's more than one way to <strong>skin</strong> a cat"", but if you try to <strong>skin</strong> a <em>tiger</em> you might end up in its <em>stomach</em>."	Take the stomach (and guts) out of a tiger and you're left with the<strong> skin</strong> (to use as a rug etc.).	When the <em>tiger</em> was autopsied, they cut open his <em>stomach</em> and pulled out a human with only his<strong> skin</strong> left. It sort of looked like a deflated blow up doll.		
虚		void	Tigers . . . row.		11	2148	1993	54	キョ、コ	むな.しい、うつ.ろ	In Japanese folklore there is no hell, but there is the<strong> void</strong>. There, a <em>row</em> of <em>tigers</em> waits in the blackness to devour those souls who have failed in their spiritual life.	If you stand in a <em>row of tigers</em> (tiger - you - tiger) there will soon be a<strong> void</strong> (tiger -<strong> void</strong> - tiger).	Warning to Sigfreid and Roy: Your entertainment contract will be null and<strong> void</strong> unless you can make all the tigers stand in a row.	When a row of tigers surrounds you, life will feel hollow and<strong> void</strong>.	"In the book ""The Life of Pi"", Pi and the <em>tiger</em> are shipwrecked on a <em>rowboat</em> for 227 days. Pi keeps as large a <strong>void</strong> as possible between them."		
戯		frolic	Void . . . fiesta.		15	2149	1994	54	ギ、ゲ	たわむ.れる、ざ.れる、じゃ.れる	This is a story about the end of the universe. The universe is turning into a featureless <em>void</em>. There's nothing we can do about it except for throw a <em>fiesta</em> and<strong> frolic</strong> a little bit before it's all over.	Sigfreid and Roy's contract having been <em>void</em>ed, the tiger is free to<strong> frolic</strong> about at the <em>fiesta</em>.	The fiesta was void. you go on a<strong> frolic</strong> of your own.	This <em>fietsa</em> has been <em>voided</em>. You'll have find somewhere else to<strong> frolic</strong>.	'frolic' to me implies something essentially empty and meaningless. It might look like a <em>fiesta</em> on the surface but somehow there's a <em>void</em> at its centre. (and there's even an 'o' in the middle of the word…).		
虞		uneasiness	Tiger . . . give.		13	2150	1995	54	グ	おそれ、おもんぱか.る、はか.る、うれ.える、あざむ.く、あやま.る、のぞ.む、たの.しむ	The dentist couldn't help but feel <strong>uneasiness</strong> as he used his <em>hand crank mouth tool</em> on the <em>tiger</em> in his chair.	My dear friend, a Bengali merchant, <em>gave</em> me a <em>tiger</em> as a birthday present. I felt <strong>uneasiness</strong>, knowing that I'll have to reject it. Or was it horror?	A <em>tiger</em> overhead would <em>give</em> anyone a feeling of<strong> uneasiness</strong>.	Tigers give me a feeling of<strong> uneasiness</strong>.

You have to think with<strong> prudence</strong> (ponder carefully) about approaching a tiger, as is evident from 虎 ."	You have to think with<strong> prudence</strong> about approaching a tiger. If not, it will eat your brains and heart. Thanks raulir.	Dear<strong> Prudence</strong>, <em>think</em> carefully before you come out to play with the <em>tiger</em> waiting for you …I know it looks beautiful.	You are inside a tiger's stomach. In retrospect, you think maybe you shouldn't have poked the tiger with a stick. Some<strong> prudence</strong> would have been a good idea. P.S. I think this is a good keyword, as it most often appears in 遠慮 えんりょ which basically means restraint or<strong> prudence</strong>.	To <em>think</em> before approaching a <em>tiger</em> is mere<strong> prudence</strong>.		
劇		drama	Tiger . . . sow . . . saber.		15	2152	1997	54	ゲキ		A great Indian <strong>drama</strong> acted out every year is how a poor Bengali boy fended off the <em>tigers</em> from his <em>pigs</em> using only a <em>sabre</em>.	"If you thought ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" was full of<strong> drama</strong> then you'll love ""The <em>Tiger</em> the <em>Sow</em> and the <em>Sword</em>""."	A very sad<strong> drama</strong> about a little boy and his pigs. You see, a tiger showed up and ate up all his sows (his only source of income), and so the boy had to find the inner courage to go after the tiger with his dad's old rusty saber. Of course the boy dies, very tragic and all. It is a<strong> drama</strong> after all.	The friends of 100 Acre Wood decide to put on a play and decide it will be a<strong> DRAMA</strong>. TIGGER and PIGLET (SOW) will be the stars and engage in a SABRE duel.	"Kermit the frog, in his new<strong> drama</strong>, ""Muppets in Bengal"", defends Miss Piggy from a tiger using only a sabre."

What is on his chest? A giant E, for EVIL, of course.	"The ""E"" shape actually means claws here, and the real etymology is a tiger tyrannizing other animals with its claws (the etymologies actually make sense once in a blue moon!). I think of the claws here as two hooks, representing the front paws. (stroke order of that part: <a href=""midori://search?text=%E4%BA%8C%EF%BC%8B"">二＋</a> last of 直 )."	The way to<strong> tyrannize</strong> a tiger is to stroke it's fur the wrong way with a broom (you don't want to use a comb because he'll eat you.).	The father<strong> tyrannize</strong>d the kids by keeping a hungry tiger in a box. In fact, one of the kids has already been fed…	"In ""The Ghost and the Darkness"", an evil <em>tiger</em> with an <em>E</em> on it's chest<strong> tyrannize</strong>s the railroad builders.

鹿		deer	"Drawn on the walls of a complex of <i>caves</i> near Niaux in southern France are a number of animal likenesses dating from the Upper Paleolithic period. Among them we find pictures of <b>deer</b>, some of them showing men in <b>deer</b> masks. By <i>comparing</i> their drawings to real <b>deer</b>, Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt; and by <i>comparing</i> themselves to the <b>deer</b>, to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a ""double-<i>key</i>"" (the extra stroke through the element for <i>key</i>) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which <i>caves</i>, a double-<i>key</i>, and <i>comparing</i> gives us the kanji for <b>deer</b>."	* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the <i>tiger</i> was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: <i>painting of a deer</i>.	11	2154	1999	54	ロク	しか、か	<em>Bambi</em> wanders into a <em>cave</em> and sees a <em>side order of salad</em> and <em>2 spoons</em>…but what's the main course?

麓		foot of a mountain	Grove . . . deer.		19	2155	2839	54	ロク	ふもと	Many <em>deer</em> can be found in the <em>grove</em> at the<strong> foot of a mountain</strong>.	<em>Deer</em> are well known for frolicking in <em>groves</em> of <em>trees</em>. However, they are not well known for actually watching where the heck they are bounding about. Here we have a bunch of dead <em>deer</em> bodies that you find at the<strong> foot of a mountain</strong>. You are trying to figure why there are so many dead <em>deer</em> in one spot, and then you trace a line up the mountain - leaves and such are scattered all the way up…to a grove. Looks like they hopped through some leaves to their doom.	The cave with the <em>deer</em> painting was found at the <strong>foot of a mountain</strong> hidden behind a <em>grove</em>. That's why it took centuries to discover.	<em>Deer</em> live in the <strong>foot</strong>hills <strong>of mountains</strong> where they can hide and shelter in <em>groves of trees</em>. Consequently, you won't find them ABOVE the 'tree line'. Note: To avoid confusion with <em>mountain goat</em> 屰, remember those wild goats are way up above the tree line on steep rocky slopes. Deer thrive in leafy green woods and pastures.	Sacred <em>deer</em> live in the <em>grove</em> at the <strong>foot of the mountain</strong>, foliage so thick that one cannot see the mountain itself.		
薦		recommend	<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>deer</i> . . . <i>one</i> . . . <i>tail feathers</i>. Note the doubling up in these last two elements as in frame 2091.		16	2156	2000	54	セン	すす.める	"Picture an ad in which Uncle Jimbo (of ""South Park"" fame)<strong> recommend</strong>s the latest craze in deer hunting : a high tech <em>slingshot</em>!

Then, all of a sudden, Bambi is brutally murdered with the <em>slingshot</em>, put on the <em>cooking fire</em>, and the camera pans to Uncle Jimbo happily munching on crispy cooked Bambi! Note: the <em>slingshot</em> is strokes 11-12."	It is<strong> recommend</strong>ed that deers stick to eating flowers. If they try to eat birds, they may end up choking on them, like this one here. Note that the head ( 白 ) is gone and the visible part of the body which is normally written with a stroke of the head must by necessity be drawn with a stroke of the tail.	For tonight's dinner (says the waiter) I would<strong> recommend</strong> the Deer. It is very special because it has been fed with flowers all it's life, has been killed with a slingshot (so there is no gun powder in it) and right now it is in the cooking fire. The meaning:<strong> recommend</strong>; mat; advise; encourage; offer.	Wow 2000 baby, almost there doubly happy now.	"One deer hunter to another: ""I <strong>recommend</strong> you to use <em>flowers</em> to attract the <em>deer</em> then use a <em>slingshot</em> to fire <em>tail feathers</em> at it""."		
慶		jubilation	<i>Deer</i> . . . <i>crown</i> (note the doubling up) . . . <i>heart</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i>. You may recall that we met the relative primitives at the bottom here before, in the kanji for <i>melancholy</i> (Frame 663).		15	2157	2001	54	ケイ	よろこ.び	"In this kanji, ""<em>deer</em>"" replaces the ""head"" primitive from the ""melancholy"" kanji. Poor Ned is feeling melancholy so Uncle Jimbo (of South Park animated series) suggests a good <em>deer</em> huntin' trip to fix that and turn that <em>melancholy</em> into<strong> jubilation</strong>."	<em>Bambi</em> was <em>melancholy</em> at the death of his mother, but is now in<strong> jubilation</strong> as he's made friends with thumper.	This kanji shows the<strong> JUBILATION</strong> that accompanies the modern holiday of Christmas. Rather than focus on the MELANCHOLY events of Christ's crucifiction (as we do on Easter), on Christmas we focus on the arrival of RUDOLPH to bring us lots of presents. Oh yeah, I guess there's a small bit of<strong> JUBILATION</strong> about Christ's birth too, but fuck that shit, I just want presents.	Hamlet's melancholy turns at once to<strong> jubilation</strong> when he discovers that his head has transformed into that of a deer's. No more will human tragedy be his source of suffering!	"The<strong> Jubilation</strong> of Haruhi Suzumiya. Here we have Haruhi, from <a href=""../v4/616.html"">melancholy</a> (#616 憂) of Haruhi Suzumiya feeling so <strong>jubilant</strong> (for a change) she's wearing an absurd <em>deer</em> mask over her head. (she only needs some horse costume to go with it, and the image of 馬鹿 is complete)."		
麗		lovely	The painting of a <i>deer</i> itself with its form and color is enough to fill the bill for an image of something <b>lovely</b>. But to give a bit of contrast, we see two <i>mediocre</i> drawings from a later age on two patches of <i>ceiling</i> above. Note that the drop in <i>mediocre</i> has been lengthened somewhat and the second stroke drawn down straight.		19	2158	2002	54	レイ	うるわ.しい、うら.らか	"The anthropologist made an exact <em>deer painting</em> from the cave <em>ceiling</em> on the <em>ceiling</em> of his house.

A <em>crocodile with raised eyebrows</em> eyes a<strong> lovely</strong> <em>deer</em> it might have for dinner.	A creepy deerophile peers with his <em>beedy eyes</em> over the top of a <em>deers</em> back, and whispers<strong> lovely</strong> to himself.		
熊		bear	<i>Elbow</i> . . . <i>meat</i> . . . <i>spoon</i> ATOP <i>spoon</i> . . . <i>oven fire</i>.		14	2159	2003	54	ユウ	くま	Most don't know it, but <strong>bear</strong>s have the <em>ability</em> to walk on <em>fire</em>. They're invincible creatures!	"Note : I don't know why James Heisig put ""bear"" ahead of ""ability"" (next frame), but I sugget to skip this, learn the next kanji (""ability"") then go back here and use <em>ability</em> as a primitive."	<strong>Bear</strong>s have the <strong>ability</strong> to smell food cooking on a camp<strong>fire</strong> from over 30ks away (true).	Smokey the<strong> Bear</strong> says: Only you have the ability to prevent forest fires.	Well, this is obviously the story of Goldilocks, who came to the<strong> bear</strong> house. She <em>elbows</em> her way in, throws her <em>flesh</em> into a chair, notices the porridge on the <em>oven fire</em>, takes one <em>spoon</em>full from one plate, then another <em>spoon</em>full from another plate.		
能		ability	Try relating this kanji to that of the previous frame. For instance, you might imagine that the test of <b>ability</b> envisioned here is removing the <i>bear</i> from the oven fire.		10	2160	2004	54	ノウ	よ.く	The amputee has no hands but only stumps of <em>flesh</em> beneath his <em>elbows</em>. To give him the<strong> ability</strong> to eat he has <em>two spoons</em> implanted in his arm stumps, one in each side.	"Kid from the Oracle's place in the Matrix (whose head is shining like the moon) is holding a a spoon and making it bend using his special<strong> ability</strong>. When Neo asks to learn this<strong> ability</strong> the child replies, "" Remember the truth Neo, there is no spoon."" Neo Proceeds to the kitchen pondering these words of wisdom. The Child smiles mischeviously and pulls a second spoon hidden up his sleeve in the crook of his elbow. ""That's right Neo,"" the child laughs, ""there is no spoon…there are two spoons!""."	This man may have the dis-<strong>ability</strong> of no <em>flesh</em> below the elbows, but he can eat with <em>2 spoons</em>, on in each foot.	I have the<strong> ability</strong> to use my <em>elbow flesh</em> to juggle <em>two spoons</em>.	I have the<strong> ability</strong> to bend two spoons. I bend one spoon with my elbow and one with my body.		
態		attitude	Ability . . . heart.		14	2161	2005	54	タイ	わざ.と	This guy has an<strong> attitude</strong> problem – lots of <em>ability</em>, but his <em>heart</em>'s not in it.	Having a good <strong>attitude</strong> means believing in your <em>heart</em> that you have the <em>ability</em> to do anything - like memorizing more than 2000 kanji, for example.	If you had the <em>ability</em> to read people's <em>hearts</em> (especially women's hearts), it'd be so easy to find out why they have such an<strong> attitude</strong>.	"""It's an<strong> attitude</strong> problem I'm afraid,"" says the teacher at parents' evening. ""He has the ABILITY to be a great but his HEART is not in it."" ""What should we do?"" says the concerned parent. ""Let's try this HEART, shall we?"" says the coach, handing over a HEART that will give their child a better<strong> attitude</strong>."	Hint: Carebears (trading fire for heart-power).		
寅		sign of the tiger	<i>House</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>sprout</i> . . . <i>animal legs</i>. Compare, and do not confuse with, the kanji in frame 1887.		11	2162	2006	55	イン	とら	If you draw the<strong> sign of the tiger</strong> on the ceiling of your house, you will sprout tiger's legs (animal legs) and be able to run and pounce like the big cats yourself.	"The<strong> sign of the tiger</strong> is that he's eaten all of the <a href=""../v4/1750.html"">yellow</a> (#1750 黄) salad in the <em>house</em>."	"I don't know why but when I read<strong> sign of the tiger</strong> I get the ""eye of the tiger song"" stuck in my head. So I see rocky training in his house. Hes hitting the <em>ceiling</em> (no punching bag) eating <em>brussel sprouts</em> to keep in good health and running with only the <em>animal legs</em> his dog."	"The zebra, at the first <em>sign of a tiger</em>, jumped into <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1109"">mid-air</a> (#1109 宙). Unfortunately, he was in his <em>house</em>, got stuck in the <em>ceiling</em>, leaving only his <em>legs</em> poking out."	Sung to the theme Survivor (Eye of the Tiger) from Rocky: It's the <strong>sign of the tiger</strong>, it's inside of a <em>house</em>, rising up to the <em>ceiling</em>, <em>sprout</em>ing higher. Yes, on <em>animal legs</em>, it's getting ready to pounce, and it's watching us all, it's the <strong>siiiiiiign of the tiger</strong>.		
演		performance	Water . . . sign of the tiger.		14	2163	2007	55	エン		That was some great <strong>performance</strong>! He caused the <em>water</em> to shoot up into the air and form the <em>sign of the tiger</em> in airborne droplets. You sure missed a great <strong>performance</strong>!	"I remember seeing advertisements growing up with the <em>sign of the tiger</em> saying to ""Put a tiger in your tank"", meaning that it would increase the<strong> performance</strong> of the <em>drops</em> of gasoline you put in."	At the end of Rocky's <strong>performances</strong>, set to the <em>Eye of the Tiger</em> of course, he was quite exhausted and dumped <em>water</em> all over himself to cool down.	<em>Tiger Wood</em>'s<strong> performance</strong> has been <em>watered</em> down by recent scandal.	"You watch a tiger do a flip into a small pool of <em>water</em> at a circus. ""What a great<strong> performance</strong>! I need to get my shirt <em>signed by that tiger</em>,"" you say to your friend."		
辰		sign of the dragon	Cliff . . . two . . . hairpins.		7	2164	2008	55	シン、ジン	たつ	<strong>Bruce Lee</strong> is such a badass he climbed a sheer vertical <em>cliff</em> using only <em>2 hairpins</em>.	"The kid said ""I don't believe you! Dragons don't exist!"" so we made a little surprise for him: we pinned a huge <strong>dragon </strong> (it was just a <strong>sign</strong> really) on a nearby <em>cliff</em>. ""Whoaaa! Dragon!"" the kid said. ""But why won't it move?"" ""I tell you why, cause it's pinned there with <em>two hairpins</em>"" I thought to myself."	As a primitive I use the image of <em>Bruce Lee</em> .	This is the image(sign) of a dragon carved into a <strong>cliff</strong> face. However, the dragon has no eyes. Legend has it that there are <strong>two</strong> magical <strong>hairpins</strong> that can be inserted into the eye sockets to make the dragon come to life.	Cliff + two + Hairpins: The<strong> sign of the dragon</strong> was carved into the <em>cliff</em> face with <em>two hairpins</em> that were abandoned in the sand below.		
辱		embarrass	Sign of the dragon . . . glue.		10	2165	2009	55	ジョク	はずかし.める	During the shooting of one of his first movies in China, <em>Bruce Lee</em> fell through the cheaply built movie set, and into a barrel of <em>glue</em>. As you can imagine, to put <em>Bruce Lee</em> in that position must have caused great embarass to the chinese producer. Note the hints in the story for the position of the primitives.	<em>Bruce Lee</em> is<strong> embarrass</strong>ed when he does a high kick and splits his pants. He has to <em>glue</em> them back together.	"The <em>sign of the dragon</em> falls off the cliff, to our great <strong>embarassment</strong> (see <a href=""../v4/2008.html"">sign of the dragon</a> (#2008 辰)) We should have <em>glued</em> it there!"	Bruce Lee was<strong> embarrass</strong>ed when his glue huffing addiction became public.	Frieza has finally brought together all the <em>Dragon Balls</em>, but he doesn't know how to summon the Dragon.. He's tried everything now, including <em>Gluing</em> the <em>Dragon Balls</em> together, and is starting to feel<strong> Embarrass</strong>ed about the whole thing.		
震		quake	Weather . . . sign of the dragon.		15	2166	2010	55	シン	ふる.う、ふる.える	<em>Bruce Lee</em> has magical abilities in his newest movie. He can conjure <em>rain</em> and earth<strong>quakes</strong>.	A la Kung Fu Hustle, <em>Bruce Lee</em> descends from the <em>storm</em> and causes an earthquake by smashing the ground.	Bruce Lee looks up and sees rain clouds gathering, so he decides to abandon filming and play<strong> Quake</strong> III instead.	It is said that earthquakes are caused when Bruce Lee gets rained on, he just hates it and punishes mother earth, punching the ground. The popularity of the legend lead to the kanji meaning anything that<strong> quake</strong>s.	Instant mythology: When heavy rains disturb a dragon hiding under the earth, an earth<strong>quake</strong> may result.		
振		shake	Fingers . . . sign of the dragon.		10	2167	2011	55	シン	ふ.る、ぶ.る、ふ.り、-ぶ.り、ふ.るう	<em>Bruce Lee</em><strong> shake</strong>s the confidence of his opponents by simply waving his <em>fingers</em> in front of them, they know that each of them is a deadly weapon in their own right. Hwwaaaa…	Your fingers will be crushed if you<strong> shake</strong> hands with Bruce Lee.	"Here someone<strong> shake</strong>s hands with <em>Bruce Lee</em> and then asks for his <em>fingers</em> back. Note : my first idea was the ""finger-shake"", Shrek the ogre's favourite milk-shake; I couldn't fit <em>sign of the dragon</em> into the story though."	<em>Bruce Lee</em><strong> shake</strong>s his <em>finger</em> at an opponent who thinks they're a match for him.	If you're talking to someone and notice that their<em>fingers</em> are starting to<strong> shake</strong>, it's often a <em>sign of the dragon</em> being behind you where the other person can see him coming.		
娠		with child	<i>Woman</i> . . . <i>sign of the dragon</i>. The key word is a synonym for <i>pregnant</i>, whose character we met earlier (Frame 546). Although the two kanji are often used together, they should be kept distinct.		10	2168	2012	55	シン		Any <em>woman</em> spending a night with the virile <em>Bruce Lee</em> is bound to end up<strong> with child</strong>.	BRUCE LEE'S WOMAN was<strong> WITH CHILD</strong> and it really upset her stomach because little Brandon Lee was kicking ass from the inside.	A <em>woman</em> who is<strong> with child</strong> can't be sacrificed to the <em>dragon</em>; virgins only need apply.	<em>Bruce Lee</em> can make a <em>woman</em><strong> with child</strong> before they even know what happened.	"The <em>woman</em> hides the dragon from poachers under her shirt, pretending she's<strong> with child</strong>. ""Seen any <em>sign of the dragon</em>?"" ask the poachers. ""Nope, haven't seen him,"" replies the woman."		
唇		lips	Sign of the dragon . . . mouth.		10	2169	2013	55	シン	くちびる	I love <em>Bruce Lee</em> dubbing. His <strong>lips</strong> move, but sometimes words don't come out of his <em>mouth</em>.	"<em>Bruce Lee</em> says ""Read my<strong> lips</strong>…"", but when I try to, his <em>mouth</em> isn't moving with the dialogue."	As I approached her <strong>lips</strong>, I began to sense <em>the sign of the dragon</em> breath coming from her <em>mouth</em>, and I almost fainted.	"(Positioning) <em>Bruce Lee</em> prefers the <strong>lips</strong> of his girlfriend's <em>mouth</em> ""down below"". Lucky bastard!"	Bruce Lee comes flying out of nowhere and kicks you right in the mouth… leaving you with fat<strong> lips</strong>.		
農		agriculture	Bend . . . sign of the dragon.		13	2170	2014	55	ノウ		The most unlikely persons in the world to take up<strong> agriculture</strong> must be Bender and Bruce Lee. An awkwared moment as they stare on the various farming utensils, hoe, plow. Both with straw hats on and blue overalls, and drawn in Groenigs irrevent style.	Bruce Lee is tough. But so is agricultural work. If Bruce took it up, even he would hurt his back from all the bending.	"(combine Immacolata & mattimus:) The most unlikely duo to take up<strong> agriculture</strong> must be <em>Bender</em> and <em>Bruce Lee</em>. An awkward moment ensues as they stand in straw hats and overalls, staring at the various farm implements. But soon Bruce Lee is spinning Bender above his head while Bender's arms and legs perform all sorts of <strong>agricultural</strong> tasks like pruning, watering, sowing… 農業 [のうぎょう] <a href=""midori://search?text=%E3%80%81%E8%BE%B2%E5%A0%B4"">、農場</a> [のうじょう]."	It's a good <strong>agricultural</strong> sign when, as the farmer is <em>bending</em> down, he discovers some plants arranged in the <em>sign of the dragon</em>. It means the weather and earth will be supportive of the crops.	<em>Bruce Lee</em> developed a <em>bend</em> in his back from doing<strong> agriculture</strong>.		
濃		concentrated	Among other things, the key word refers to the thick consistency of liquids. Its elements: <i>water</i> . . . <i>agriculture</i>.		16	2171	2015	55	ノウ	こ.い	The <em>agriculture</em> of Florida is<strong> concentrated</strong> on making<strong> concentrated</strong> orange juice. Just add <em>water</em>! Imagine a can of FCOJ, dumping it into a pitcher and adding <em>water</em>.	<strong>Concentrated</strong> <em>water</em> is going to revolutionize the <em>agriculture</em>! Just add water… oh wait…	History has shown that agriculture usually is<strong> concentrated</strong> around bodies of water.	Those who work in <em>agriculture</em> like their coffee strong and<strong> concentrated</strong> to help them wake up at the crack of dawn. Almost any guest to their breakfast table will want to <em>water</em> it down. (adapted from darg_sama, because I like strong coffee).	<em>Water</em> extracted from <em>agricultural</em> products makes them<strong> concentrated</strong>.		
送		send off	Road . . . golden calf.		9	2172	2016	55	ソウ	おく.る	After worshipping the <em>golden calf</em>, God sent the Jews on a long <em>road</em> through the wilderness.	"The problem with the ""gold calf"" primitive is that the first vertical stroke of ""heavenly"" is shorter than the second stroke. But as we know, ""heavenly"" clearly has the FIRST stroke longer, not the second. The primitives we really have here are ""animal horns (first 3 strokes)"" and ""big/dog (last 3 strokes)."" What are the BIGGEST ANIMAL HORNS that you can think of? For me its a MASTODON. STORY: In caveman times, you SENT OFF packages with the MASTODON express."	I couldn't stand the <em>horny St. Bernard</em> any longer, so I <strong>escorted</strong> it to the <em>road</em> and gave it a<strong> send off</strong> to go get neutered.	(note: I changed golden calf to Satan: came from heaven and grew horns) Satan was escorted by Michael during his<strong> send off</strong> down the roads of heaven.	Primitive: Animal horns + big =<em> Wooly Mammoth</em>. Story:There was a big<strong> send off</strong> for <em>Wooly mammoth</em> and all his friends waved goodbye as he left down the <em>road</em>.		
関		connection	Gates . . . golden calf.		14	2173	2017	55	カン	せき、-ぜき、かか.わる、からくり、かんぬき	The <em>golden calf</em> is sent to the <em>gates of Hell</em> for it's<strong> connection</strong> to false idols.	There's a weird<strong> connection</strong> between worshipping the <em>golden calf</em> and visiting the <em>gates of Hell</em>.	See my story for 2016. The<strong> CONNECTION</strong> between the GATES OF HELL and MASTODONS is that the GATES were made out of MASTODON horns (b/c they so big and old).	At the airport, the <em>woolly mammoth</em> was too big. When he tried to go through his flight's <em>gate</em> he got stuck and missed his <strong>connecting</strong> flight.	"<em>Bill Gates</em> and the <em>woolly mammoth</em> gazed longingly at one another. Bill squeezed her hand gently; ""Do you feel it? The<strong> connection</strong>? It's… electric."" The mammoth blushed, twinges of anticipation and fear coursing through her heart. Could they really start over? She didn't want to get hurt again, but the<strong> connection</strong> was still so deep; so real. She looked Bill in the eyes: ""Don't you break my heart again Bill."" ""I love you, baby. Let's go back to my place. I'm going to get Pleistocene on your fat ass.""."		
咲		blossom	Mouth . . . golden calf.		9	2174	2018	55	ショウ	さ.く、-ざき	Evil<strong> blossom</strong>s from the <em>mouths</em> of those who worship the <em>golden calf</em>. (Playing it safe and avoiding the image of a flower completely).	It's the circle of life. The <em>woolly mammoth</em> died, but the mammoth's body was able to provide nutrition to the new plants, <strong>blossoming</strong> out of the <em>mouth</em> of the dead <em>mammoth</em>.	A <em>horny St. Bernard</em> so desperate, it tries to use the <em>opening</em> in a flower<strong> blossom</strong>.	See my story for 1016. Caveman magic: making flowers<strong> BLOSSOM</strong> out of the MOUTH of a MASTODON.	Remember that TV show<strong> Blossom</strong>? It was about a girl with a big <em>mouth</em> and a nose the size of a <em>mastodon</em>'s!		
鬼		ghost	Drop of . . . brains . . . human legs . . . elbow.		10	2175	2019	55	キ	おに、おに-	A <strong>ghost</strong>, or <strong>oni</strong>, wandering slowly on its <em>human legs</em>, searching for <em>brains</em> to eat. What looks like an <em>elbow</em> here is actually a pictoral representation of the <em>forked tail</em> protruding out of its rear.	<strong>Ghost</strong>s aren't very intelligent - they have but a <em>drop</em> of <em>brains</em> - so can't tell the difference between an <em>elbow</em> and a pair of <em>human legs</em>.	Building on Matthew's excellent image, the <em>drop</em> can be the single horn sticking out of the <strong>oni</strong>'s forehead.	"鬼 (おに) is not a<strong> ghost</strong>. An ogre or a troll would be a more fitting translation. Such a thing has but a drop of brains and uses its legs and elbows as deadly weapons (a concept which should be familiar from the <a href=""../v4/765.html"">license</a> (#765 允) to kill). I'll use ""ogre"" for this."	This<strong> ghost</strong> had only a <em>drop of brains</em>, his <em>legs</em> and <em>elbow</em> were easily visible from under his sheet.		
醜		ugly	Whiskey bottle . . . ghost.		17	2176	2020	55	シュウ	みにく.い、しこ	The<strong> ugly</strong> <em>oni</em> can't get a date so he drinks <em>sake</em> by himself at the bar.	Drink enough <em>whisky</em> and not even an <em>oni</em> looks<strong> ugly</strong> any more…	Drinking too much <em>whisky</em> can make you as<strong> ugly</strong> as an <em>oni</em>.	In the movie 'The Shining', Jack Nicholson is so drunk on <em>whiskey</em> that he doesn't realize the woman he's dancing with is an<strong> ugly</strong> <em>ghost</em>.	A demon with a horn and a forked tail enters the bar. Everybody runs away, except one drunken fella who is drinking straight from the whiskey bottle. The demon apporaches him. The fella turns around. While sipping some more whiskey his famous last words: ' You are the ugliest demon I have ever seen'.		
魂		soul	Rising cloud of . . . ghosts.		14	2177	2021	55	コン	たましい、たま	When we die, our<strong> soul</strong> rises up in a <em>ghost</em>like <em>rising cloud</em> of mist up to heaven (we hope) (Adapted from darg_sama,28-10-2005).	When you die, your<strong> SOUL</strong> either goes to the RISING CLOUDS (heaven) or to the ONI (hell, the devil).	There exists a<strong> soul</strong> within us all. When we die, our ghost rises up like a rising cloud out of our bodies.	After death, your<strong> soul</strong> may go up like a <em>rising cloud</em>, or stay as a <em>ghost</em>.	"Just as a sidenote, <a href=""midori://search?text=%E9%AD%82%EF%BC%9D%E3%81%A0%E3%81%BE%E3%81%97%E3%81%84"">魂＝だましい</a> , from Katamari Damacy ( 塊魂 )."		
魔		witch	<i>Hemp</i> . . . <i>ghost</i>. Take care not to confuse with the primitive of the same name we learned earlier (Frame 458).		21	2178	2022	55	マ		The<strong> witch</strong> sold me some <em>hemp</em> that made me see <em>ghosts</em> don't do drugs.	This modern version of the<strong> witch</strong> lives in some hippie community. She smokes a lot of <em>hemp</em>, and spends the day talking to <em>ghosts</em>, which not surprisingly appears only to her.	The<strong> witch</strong> inhales her special HEMP herb which sends her into a trance state in which she can commune with ONI (or ghosts or demons whatever your fancy).	This is a<strong> WITCH</strong> which is making a MAgic potion (this character is read ま and is heavily related to magic). The ingredients? Some <strong>hemp</strong> and an <strong>ogre's</strong> corpse. (yuck!).	The<strong> witch</strong> and the <em>oni</em> sit around smoking <em>hemp</em>. Getting high without a broomstick! ( 魔女 ).		
魅		fascination	Ghost . . . not yet.		15	2179	2023	55	ミ		<em>Ghosts</em> have <em>not yet</em> left the world, they must still have a deep<strong> fascination</strong> with their past life on Earth.	Even in these modern times our<strong> fascination</strong> with ghosts has not yet ended.	The only people who have a<strong> fascination</strong> with <em>oni</em> are those that have <em>not yet</em> met one. 魅力 (みりょく) : charm,<strong> fascination</strong>, glamour.	"Here the ""Ghostbusters"" founder talks about his<strong> fascination</strong> for <em>ghosts</em> (picture Dan Arkroyd in the movie if that helps). He says he has a<strong> fascination</strong> for ghosts ever since he saw one as a teenager. Since then he's been scouring all of the world, trying to capture them on tape, on video… A journalist asks ""When will it end ? Aren't you tired of chasing ghosts ?"" ""Oh no, <em>not yet</em> ! Not until I become a <em>ghost</em> myself anyway !""."	Your<strong> fascination</strong> with <em>ghosts</em> is because you have <em>not yet</em> seen one. When you do, you'll do your best to get as far from them as possible…		
塊		clod	Soil . . . ghost.		13	2180	2024	55	カイ、ケ	かたまり、つちくれ	This word somehow reminds me of a golem… an <em>oni</em> made from <em>soil</em>.	Without any weapons, our only defense was to throw <strong>clod</strong>s of <em>dirt</em> at the advancing <em>zombie</em> horde.	"<a href=""midori://search?text=%E5%A1%8A%EF%BC%9D%E3%81%8B%E3%81%9F%E3%81%BE%E3%82%8A"">塊＝かたまり</a> , from Katamari Damacy ( 塊魂 ). Imagine playing Katamari Damacy; on this level you start with a<strong> clod</strong> of <em>dirt</em>, and roll up <em>demons</em> into it."	"Easy: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem</a> (or if you prefer, <a href=""http://schwicky.net/xfiles/episodes/4/kaddish/"">http://schwicky.net/xfiles/episodes/4/kaddish/</a>)."	Remember the whole ghost of Mars debate? When they first took pictures of the Martian <em>soil</em>, the picture looked like it contained a <em>ghost</em>. But later photographs showed it was a mere<strong> clod</strong> of soil.		
襲		attack	<i>Vase</i> . . . <i>meat</i> . . . <i>slingshot</i> (doubled up with) <i>snake</i> . . . <i>three</i> . . . <i>garment</i>. The top half of this character is the old form for the kanji in frame 575.		22	2181	2025	55	シュウ	おそ.う、かさ.ね	"The top 16 strokes are the chinese radical for ""dragon"". Joining up both meanings of the radical we can name the top part of this kanji ""imperial dragon"". Two-headed snakes do exist as biological curiosities, and they look a bit like a <em>slingshot</em> (with the heads splitting at a junction). Our <em>imperial dragon</em> here, the pet of a Chinese emperor, is a rare ""three-headed slingshot-snake"" kept in a <em>vase</em> and fed with <em>meat</em>. When the emperor<strong> attack</strong>ed neighbours, his army wore the <em>imperial dragon garment</em>."	"Fuaburisu's story is incredibly good, but I made it a bit simpler: The <em>imperial dragon</em> is a rare ""<em>three-headed slingshot-snake</em>"", kept in a <em>vase</em> and fed with <em>meat</em>. It's very aggressive, so at feeding time you need to wear the special <em>garment</em> or it will<strong> attack</strong> you."	"You<strong> attack</strong> an <em>old dragon</em> 龍 and take his <em>clothes</em>. REF: <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2981"">dragon [old]</a> (#2981 龍)."

嚇		upbraid			17	2182	2026	56	カク	おど.かす	To<strong> upbraid</strong> someone, you criticize them in a menacing way. In other words, you jaw at them with your MOUTH until both sides of their face turn RED (hence the double-red).	"Tip: Heisig later names 赫 ""red + red"" as <a href=""../v4/2908.html"">incandescent</a> (#2908 赫). Story: ""So the boss<strong> upbraid</strong>ed you, huh?"". ""Yep, his <em>mouth</em> was <em>incandescent</em>."	Halpern's dictionary goes with <strong>intimidate</strong>, so I'll stick to <strong>menacing</strong>. The kanji for red ( 赤 ) is usually only fully formed when it is on the left, as in 赦 , so as a primitive, fully red on the left = <em>commie</em>. This kanji is unusual in that the commies (2 of them!) have moved over to the right and taken over this entire kanji. The little mouth on the left is protesting what can only be a pictoral representation of the <strong>red menace</strong>.	"A father <strong>upbraid</strong>s his daughter for the <em>red</em> lipstick and little <em>red</em> dress. ""You're not going out like that!""."	Kanji meanings : to reproach, to scold (note the <em>mouth</em> to the left). This english word is unusual for me, as I thought it referred to braids. So to tie it all up together I imagine two women of the middle-age playing cards. One of them puts down <em>a pair of reds</em> (the <em>red</em> cards, to avoid the primitive <em>two</em>, which is not the same). The other woman thinks she is cheating, and they start scolding each other (that is<strong> upbraid</strong>ing, with their <em>mouth</em>), and pulling each other's braids up.

錬		tempering			16	2186	2030	56	レン	ね.る	<strong>Tempering</strong> should be done with the <em>metal</em> facing <em>east</em>. (If not, the metal may pick up the earth's magnetic field).	In the East, especially Japan …there are masters of<strong> tempering</strong> <em>metal</em> to great strength….on the Spring of Trivia show in Japan I saw how a Japanese sword …actually split flying bullets…all because of special Eastern<strong> tempering</strong> techniques.	The old sword smiths of the <em>East</em> were rightly famous. The secret of course was in how they <strong>tempered</strong> the <em>metal</em>.	<strong>Tempering</strong> metal in the East… sounds like Pittsburgh to me! After all, Pittsburgh is a city in the eastern region of the US and is famous for steel working, or<strong> tempering</strong> of metal.	The<strong> tempering</strong> of <em>metal</em> was mastered in the <em>East</em> for the making of swords.

且		moreover			5	2190	2034	56	ショ、ソ、ショウ	か.つ	<em>Moreover</em> is a literary term to <em>shelve</em> what you had just been talking about, to come back to it later.	"Same as darg_sama. Play on words.

After spending an hour showing you all the trophies in the <em>glass shelf</em>, you think ""Whew!

璽		imperial seal			19	2194	2075	56	ジ		If you find a <em>jewel</em> with the<strong> imperial seal</strong> on it, just <em>let it be</em>. You wouldn't want to be accused of stealing the royal family <em>jewels</em>.	This aquatic mammal belongs to the emperor, so it's an <strong>imperial seal</strong>. Nobody is allowed to mess with it. They have to <em>let it be</em> wherever it wants to go. You can spot it from the other seals by the <em>jewel</em> studded collar around the neck of the <strong>imperial seal</strong>, but above all, remember to <em>let it be</em>.	You might not like the<strong> imperial seal</strong> but the boss man designed it himself so it's a <em>jewel</em> that you should just <em>let be</em>. This is apparently the only 常用漢字 not included in RTK1.	"The<strong> imperial seal</strong> is carved from a big <em>jewel</em>. The emperor uses it to seal new laws, while positioned over it, saying <em>""Let it be""</em>."

潟		lagoon			15	2195	2039	56	セキ	かた、-がた	Right part: <em>mortar</em> <em>bound up</em> over <em>oven fire</em>, comprising <em>boiling cauldron</em>. <strong>Lagoon</strong> is a shallow pond, thus easily warmed by sun, large-scale equivalent of a <em>boiling cauldron</em>.	"The top right primitive appears in Remembering the Kanji, Volume 3 : <em>mortar</em> = <em>back-to-back staples</em> [6] (""The mortar referred to here is a stone or wooden basin used for grinding with a pestle.""). Thus we have <em>water . . . mortar . . . bound up . . . cooking fire</em>."	In an effort to appease the hideous monster from the black<strong> lagoon</strong>, nearby villagers grind up <em>tail feathers</em> of local birds in a <em>mortar</em> and sprinkle the powder in the <em>water</em>, in a primitive magic ritual that they hope will appease the monster. Note the first drop before the tail feathers, as the hook stroke of tail feathers always requires a vertical-like stroke to attach to (compare with do, bird).	While visiting Niigata ( 新潟 ) I come across a<strong> lagoon</strong> and notice big splashes of <em>water</em> occurring every few seconds. It is their mortar-throwing contest where they bind up a <em>mortar</em> with <em>tail-feathers</em> (to make it fly better) and then see who can throw it furthrest across the<strong> lagoon</strong>.	PRIMITIVE: The new element here (top right) is what I am calling <em>gray</em>, because it is similar to white, except that it has a leak at the top which lets darkness in. Therefore, the white turns to gray. STORY: The <em>gray</em> <em>water</em> of <strong>lagoons</strong> is due to the <em>gray</em> ashes of <em>bound up</em> <em>oven fires</em> (campfires) that some people have on the shore. Then the waves and wind move them into the <em>water</em> making it look filthy.

Under a <em>glass canopy</em>, <em>one drop of</em><strong> cinnabar</strong> is shown to the young chemists.<strong> Cinnabar</strong> is a source of mercury and should not be exposed to the same air that we breathe.	"Inspired by Philip K Dick (and Immacolata) - Stay inside the <em>Glass canopy</em> (Total Recall) and don't risk breathing <em>one drop</em> of Mars (the<strong> cinnabar</strong> planet) ""air"".

A stanchion is a great symbol for the<strong> SIGN OF THE COW</strong>, since modern, domesticated cows are often stanchioned in barns.	77 cows behind a fence.	There's no<strong> sign of the cow</strong>. She saw those <em>daggers</em> – <em>two</em> of them – and ran off.	"(Slight adjustment of raseru's story.)

The<strong> sign of the hare</strong> is an Easter Bunny, with it's eggs that have no yoke (instead, they have candy).	"In this version of the story of the ""Turtle and Rabbit Run a Race"", the rabbit stops on his way to a shop where they sell <em>stamps</em>, just meters away from the finishing line. In the shop, the rabbit quickly forgets about time and spends hours looking at stamps, finally after choosing a good hundred <em>stamps</em> to buy, he receives a very long <em>receipt</em>, and pays for them.
