<h1>LFS: a primer</h1>
<a name="1:1"><div class="section"><h4>introduction</h4></a>
<p>in my experience, many network engineers lack an intuition about what linux is and how it works, despite its increasing importance in our field.
counting myself among them, i set out to deepen my understanding.
the foremost resource for that purpose is Linux From Scratch, but after skimming through the book, i felt that i first needed a higher level overview of the material.
this article is the first in a series intended to supplement LFS.
</p>
<p>a bash script is available which runs all of the commands found below.
both this HTML and the bash script are generated from the same source file, which was written using literate programming techniques.
</p>
<p>if you'd like to follow along, i suggest a clean install of ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.

<p>we first install the required packages.
those important to know will be discussed further on.
we'll also create a working directory for the sake of tidiness, and change into it.
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:2"><div class="section"><h4>stage0 - running a linux kernel</h4></a>
<p>linux is a type of computer program called a kernel.
a kernel manages resources (e.g. RAM), and provides an interface through which applications can use them.
despite what you may have read, linux is not an operating system; what that means in practice will become clear shortly.
when a linux system boots, the kernel is loaded into memory from a compressed image on disk.
that image, along with everything else required at boot time, can by convention be found in the /boot directory.

<p>in our case the kernel image currently in use is <code>vmlinuz-6.2.0-39-generic</code>.
(if you are curious about the filename, it is an abbreviation of "Virtual Memory Linux Gzip", another convention.)
check its permissions and ensure that it is readable as above, otherwise we will run into problems.
</p>
<p>having found the linux kernel image used by our currently running system, what do you suppose happens if we boot it?
to find out, we'll use a program called qemu.</style>
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{stage0 boot <a href="LFSp.html#1:2">2</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512M -kernel /boot/vmlinuz
</pre>



</div>
<p><code>qemu-system-x86_64</code> is an emulator for PC systems (that is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible#The_IBM_PC_compatible_today">IBM PC compatible</a> systems) based on the AMD64 architecture - qemu can emulate many platforms, but this is what we will use because of its ubiquity.
we give it some memory with the <code>-m</code> flag, and it will very kindly load our kernel for us directly, allowing us to sidestep the hassle of creating a bootable disk image (for now).
in the new window that appears you will see rapidly scrolling output as the kernel initializes, which stops just as rapidly when the kernel "panics" (crashes).
so, we have answered our earlier question - when we run a linux kernel directly, it crashes almost immediately.
</p>
<p>let's explore why that is, and what we can do about it.
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:3"><div class="section"><h4>stage1 - mounting a root filesystem</h4></a>
<pre>
[    1.949579] Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>the kernel is letting us know that it can't boot without a filesystem.
it does not tell us why, but to be fair, inside the error emitted during a kernel panic is hardly the time or place.
we will find out why soon enough; for now, we need to tell our kernel on which device the root filesystem can be found; to do so we pass it the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bootparam.7.html">boot parameter</a> <code>root=</code>.
let's create a disk image to provide to qemu, which will make it available for our linux kernel to use.
there are many ways to do this, but the tool <code>virt-make-fs</code> works well and abstracts away the details, so we'll use it.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{create rootfs <a href="LFSp.html#1:3">3</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
mkdir rootfs
virt-make-fs --format=qcow2 --type=ext2 rootfs rootfs.ext2.qcow2
</pre>



</div>
<p>we make a directory <code>rootfs</code> and use <code>virt-make-fs</code> to create a qcow2 disk image, on which is an ext2 filesystem containing the contents of the aformentioned directory (currently, nothing).
now we can try booting again:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{stage1 boot <a href="LFSp.html#1:3">3</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512M -kernel /boot/vmlinuz -hda rootfs.ext2.qcow2 -append "root=/dev/sda"  
</pre>



</div>
<p><code>-hda</code> attaches the image file we created to our linux kernel as a SCSI device.
<code>-append</code> passes parameters to the kernel, and in this case it sets the value of <code>root=</code> to <code>/dev/sda</code>.
<code>/dev/sda</code> is a path representing the first SCSI device attached to the system; subsequent devices are named sdb, sdc, and so on.
</p>
<p>executing this command, we hit a different panic.
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:4"><div class="section"><h4>stage2 - executing an init program</h4></a>
<pre>
[    1.966493] Kernel panic - not syncing: No working init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel. See Linux Documentation/admin-guide/init.rst for guidance.
</pre>
<p>the kernel found our root filesystem, and looked there unsuccessfully for a program called <code>init</code>.
<code>init</code> is a user level program which the kernel executes as the final step of initialization. 
let's create our own example init program and see if our linux kernel will run it.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{create simple init <a href="LFSp.html#1:4">4</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
mkdir rootfs/sbin
gcc -static -o rootfs/sbin/init -x c - &lt;&lt; EOF
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

void main() {
    while(1){
      printf("Hello, World!\n");
      sleep(1);
    }
}
EOF
virt-make-fs --format=qcow2 --type=ext2 rootfs rootfs.ext2.qcow2
</pre>



</div>
<p>this is a simple C program that will print "Hello, World!" every second in an infinite loop.
the details of the program and how it is compiled are not important for our purposes, save two points.
firstly that we have written the program as an infinite loop quite deliberately - what do you suppose would have happened if we hadn't?
and secondly that we have built the program statically, meaning that its dependencies are included in the resulting binary - it does not require access to any shared libraries, which is good, because it is currently the only file on our disk.
</p>
<p>+we make a directory called <code>sbin</code> because that is the first place linux looks for an <code>init</code> program; alternatively we could provide the <code>init=</code> parameter to tell the kernel what the program is called and where on our root filesystem it is located.
we also need to remember to recreate our rootfs disk image with <code>virt-make-fs</code> now that we've modified the directory it is built from.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{stage2 boot <a href="LFSp.html#1:4">4</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512M -kernel /boot/vmlinuz -hda rootfs.ext2.qcow2 -append "root=/dev/sda"
</pre>



</div>
<p>granted, it's not very useful, but at least it hasn't crashed - we finally have our linux kernel running.
i hope you can see now that it is not (only) pedantry that drives some to insist on linux' status as "just" a kernel and not an OS; the distinction is an important one.
(okay, in some contexts it is fine to refer to the "Linux operating system"; just don't get confused)
building an operating system with the linux kernel at the centre is the job of distributions, and the focus of Linux From Scratch, so we won't explore it in this primer.
instead: qemu has been giving us quite a leg up by running our kernel directly for us, and that's not cricket.
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:5"><div class="section"><h4>stage3 - booting from disk with UEFI</h4></a>
<p>you likely know what a BIOS is and does; you may not know that almost no modern computers ship with a BIOS - they now use UEFI.
these are in fact entirely different things, although some mistakenly (but understandably) believe that BIOS is a generic term, and that UEFI is a "type of" BIOS.
because BIOS is by now a legacy standard, we will be using qemu's UEFI firmware, which is called OVMF, to boot our kernel image from disk.
this is a topic that can get very complicated, but fortunately for our purposes there are only four major concepts we need to understand:
</p>
<p>the UEFI boot manager
</p>
<p>this is the program, included in implementations of UEFI, that is responsible for (among other things) loading UEFI applications.
the boot manager is programmable via variables which are written to an NVRAM chip on your motherboard (similar to the older CMOS chip and battery system it replaced).
"boot options" are a type of NVRAM variable which contain a pointer to a hardware device and to a file on that device, which is the UEFI application to be loaded.
</p>
<p>UEFI applications
these are just programs that have been written in a particular way, such that they can be loaded by the boot manager.
boot loaders are an example of the sort of program that would be written in this way; much like how a linux kernel runs and hands off control to <code>init</code>, UEFI can execute a boot loader program, which will then handle starting your OS.
</p>
<p>GUID partition tables
</p>
<p>GPT is a standard for the layout of partition tables, and all compliant UEFI firmware is required to be able to understand it.
as UEFI replaced BIOS, GPT replaced MBR-based partitioning schemes.
</p>
<p>EFI system partitions
an ESP is a FAT-formatted partition given a specific GPT partition type, and again, all compliant UEFI firmware is required to be able to read it.
</p>
<p>if you are interested and want more details about any of this, i highly recommend going straight to the <a href="https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/index.html">UEFI specification</a>, because sadly the web is full of misinformation about UEFI.
but with the information we have now, we can piece together what is required: we must create a new GPT-partitioned disk image, create an EFI system partition on the disk, write a UEFI application that will boot our linux image, copy it to the ESP, write a boot option describing the location of the application and write it to NVRAM.
needless to say, this is quite a lot of work.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{create efi structure <a href="LFSp.html#1:5">5</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
mkdir --parents rootfs/EFI/BOOT
cp /boot/vmlinuz rootfs/EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI
virt-make-fs --format=qcow2 --type=fat rootfs rootfs.fat.qcow2
</pre>



</div>
<p>so let's cheat.
in the absence of any valid boot option, the boot manager will enumerate all devices and attempt to boot from each, using the default path <code>\EFI\BOOT\BOOT[machine type short-name].EFI</code>
the specification <a href="https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/02_Overview.html#overview">states</a>: "An UEFI-defined System Partition is required by UEFI to boot from a block device"
happily for us, however, OVMF will find and execute <code>BOOTx64.EFI</code> on any FAT filesystem - it does not require the image to be on an ESP, nor even that the filesystem be partitioned at all.
we'll take advantage of that fact and skip creating an ESP for now - it will be covered in detail in the next article in this series.
</p>
<p>you might be surprised to see that we can just rename our kernel image and have UEFI boot it - does this mean that linux is a UEFI application?
if compiled with the configuration option CONFIG_EFI_STUB enabled, yes; this is called the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/efi-stub.html">EFI Boot Stub</a> and it has saved us a great deal of effort.
</p>
<p>as complex as this seemed at first, in practice all we've needed to do is rename our kernel image and store it in a particular location on a FAT formatted disk.
now we can boot it:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{stage3 boot <a href="LFSp.html#1:5">5</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512M -bios /usr/share/qemu/OVMF.fd -hda rootfs.fat.qcow2
</pre>



</div>
<p>of course, this does not work; attentive readers will have already spotted the problem.
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:6"><div class="section"><h4>stage4 - creating an initramfs</h4></a>
<p>now that qemu is no longer booting our kernel for us, it can't pass along the required boot parameter <code>root=</code>.
OVMF is able to find and boot our kernel image from the disk we provided, but we are again seeing a panic because the kernel doesn't know on what device to find the root filesystem.
we have a few options to fix this, but first we will take this opportunity to introduce another method by which linux can boot: initramfs.
</p>
<p><code>root=</code> has some serious limitations, which led to the development of alternative solutions, including initramfs.
for instance, what if our root filesystem is encrypted, or located on a network share?
the kernel can't be expected to know how to handle complex cases like these.
an initramfs image is a compressed archive of a particular format, which the linux kernel extracts into a small RAM-based root filesystem called, funnily enough, rootfs.
it can be loaded at runtime, or bundled in to the kernel at compile time.
after extracting, the kernel checks this filesystem for an <code>init</code> program and if found, dutifully runs it for us.
from that point on, the kernel is absolved of responsibility, and it is the job of <code>init</code> to get the real system up and running.
</p>
<p>for more information, the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.html?highlight=initramfs">kernel documentation</a> is the best resource.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{create initramfs <a href="LFSp.html#1:6">6</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
mkdir --parents initramfs/EFI/BOOT
cp rootfs/EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI initramfs/EFI/BOOT/vmlinuz.EFI
</pre>



</div>
<p>first we'll create a new directory for our initramfs, and copy the kernel image from our rootfs into it.
we need to rename it because we no longer want OVMF to boot it for us.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{create initramfs <a href="LFSp.html#1:6">6</a>} +=</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
(
cd rootfs/sbin
echo init | cpio --quiet --create --format=newc | gzip &gt; ../../initramfs/initramfs_data.cpio.gz
)
</pre>



</div>
<p>the 'particular format' required for an initramfs we mentioned earlier is an SVR4 cpio archive, compressed with gzip.
gzip is a very common compression format that you have likely come across before, but cpio is rather more esoteric.
the <code>cpio</code> tool creates archives from a list of filenames; as we only wish to copy <code>init</code> to our initramfs, that is the only name we provide.
<code>--format=newc</code> ensures we create an SVR4 archive; by default, <code>cpio</code> uses an obsolete binary format.
the archive is then piped to <code>gzip</code>, which compresses it and writes it out to the initramfs directory.
</p>
<p>having created an initramfs image, we need to provide it to our kernel somehow.
bundling it in at build time is a little involved, so we will come to it later, and for now let's see how the kernel can load an initramfs image at runtime.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{create initramfs <a href="LFSp.html#1:6">6</a>} +=</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
cat &gt; initramfs/startup.nsh &lt;&lt; EOF 
vmlinuz.EFI initrd=initramfs_data.cpio.gz
EOF
virt-make-fs --format=qcow2 --type=fat initramfs initramfs.fat.qcow2
</pre>



</div>
<p>the kernel parameter <code>initrd=</code> is used to specify the location of the initramfs image, and to actually pass it to the kernel, we will make use of the UEFI shell.
UEFI firmware provides a shell environment (with a <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Shell_2_2.pdf">specification</a> of its own) which can be used for tasks like launching UEFI applications and modifying NVRAM variables.
we can run <code>vmlinuz.EFI</code> from the shell ourselves, but having to do that manually at every boot would be inconvenient - luckily we don't have to.
OVMF drops into the shell when it fails to boot, and when the shell initializes, it tries to run a special script called <code>startup.nsh</code>.
we create that script file, and inside it we provide the name of the application we want to execute and its arguments.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{stage4 boot <a href="LFSp.html#1:6">6</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512M -bios /usr/share/qemu/OVMF.fd -hda initramfs.fat.qcow2 -net none
</pre>



</div>
<p>(we use <code>-net none</code> here because without it OVMF will attempt a network boot, and we don't want to have to wait for that to time out.)
this works, but it is a bit of a hack, and slows our boot time considerably.
so let us explore the second, more fun approach to loading our initramfs image - building it into the kernel!
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:7"><div class="section"><h4>stage5 - building a custom kernel</h4></a>
<p>perhaps compiling your own kernel seems daunting, but really it is very simple, and to know how to do it for yourself is a useful skill.
</p>
<p>let's grab the kernel source code.
we use <code>--depth 1</code> to create a shallow clone, pulling only the latest commit and not the entire history.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{build kernel <a href="LFSp.html#1:7">7</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
git clone --depth 1 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
</pre>



</div>
<p>there are several ways we can bundle our initramfs into the kernel.
for us, the simplest option would be to provide the kernel with the filepath to our image - we've already prepared it in the correct format, so we can have the build process unpack it directly.
if we hadn't already packaged our files up, the kernel build can do it for us if we provide it with a target directory, which is convenient.
however the most powerful method is to use a configuration file, so that is what we shall do.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{build kernel <a href="LFSp.html#1:7">7</a>} +=</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
cp rootfs/sbin/init linux/usr/
cat &gt; linux/usr/initramfs_list &lt;&lt; EOF 
dir /dev 0755 0 0
nod /dev/console 0600 0 0 c 5 1
file /init usr/init 500 0 0
EOF
</pre>



</div>
<p>we first copy our init program to a location accessible by the build process, and then we create initramfs_list.
this configuration file describes what the contents of the initramfs should be, and the <code>usr/gen_init_cpio.c</code> program makes it so.
to explain each line in turn:
</p>
<p><code>dir /dev 0755 0 0</code> creates the directory <code>/dev</code>, and the numbers following are its mode (access permissions and special mode flags).
<code>nod /dev/console 0600 0 0 c 5 1</code> creates the device node <code>/dev/console</code> with the given mode, where <code>c 5 1</code> identifies the device; see <code>linux/Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt</code> for more information.
<code>file /init usr/init 500 0 0</code> creates the file <code>/init</code> from the local file <code>usr/init</code> with the given mode.
</p>
<p>the reason we now have to create <code>/dev/console</code> is that when we were providing an external initramfs image, it was appended to the kernel's default one (found at <code>linux/usr/default_cpio_list</code>) which included it for us.
when we bundle the image in at build time, it overwrites the default, and without <code>/dev/console</code> we get no output when we boot our system.

<p>there are really only two stages to building the linux kernel - configuration and compilation.
to customise our kernel, we need to modify a file called <code>.config</code> which contains a list of kernel configuration options.
we will use the <code>scripts/config</code> utility to do this, because it allows for non-interactive configuration of kernel build options from the command line, instead of the usual menu-based methods.
we then use the build tool <code>make</code> to compile the kernel with the options we have specified.
<code>make mrproper</code> cleans up the build environment, and <code>make defconfig</code> sets the default options in <code>.config</code>.
<code>CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE</code> tells the kernel from where it can load an initramfs image, and we point it at the configuration file we created; however, this could also be set to an initramfs image or to a directory, as described previously.
when enabled, <code>CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL</code> allows us to set <code>CONFIG_CMDLINE</code>, which we use to pass runtime parameters to the kernel.
<code>make olddefconfig</code> updates our <code>.config</code> file with the new values we have set, and also sets any new options to their default value rather than prompting the user to decide what to do.
the final <code>make</code> is what actually kicks off the kernel build process, and <code>-j "$(nproc)"</code> allows it to use all of our CPU cores for faster compilation.
</p>
<p>exercise for the reader: use <code>make allnoconfig</code> instead of <code>make defconfig</code> to clear your <code>.config</code> of all kernel configuration options, and then set the bare minimum number of kernel options required to boot.
note: i intended to do this myself for this post, but i could not get it working. if you manage to figure it out, please do let me know!

</div>
<p>the output of the build process (i.e. the kernel), is written to <code>linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>; we copy it to our initramfs directory and rebuild our disk image.

</div>
<p>(we now have to use <code>-nographic</code> because our custom linux kernel has not been built with support for graphics.)
we are now successfully booting linux from disk via UEFI and running our custom init program from an initramfs!
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:8"><div class="section"><h4>stage6 - busybox</h4></a>
<p>it's about time we set aside our example init program and booted something more useful.
a great option for a minimal init program is <a href="https://busybox.net/about.html">busybox</a>.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{busybox initramfs <a href="LFSp.html#1:8">8</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
cat &gt; linux/usr/initramfs_list &lt;&lt; EOF

dir /bin 755 0 0
file /bin/busybox usr/busybox 755 0 0
file /init usr/init 500 0 0
EOF
</pre>



</div>
<p>we recognise most of this, but this time we are also creating a <code>/bin</code> directory in which we put <code>busybox</code>.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{busybox initramfs <a href="LFSp.html#1:8">8</a>} +=</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
(
cd linux/usr
wget https://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.35.0-x86_64-linux-musl/busybox
chmod +x busybox

cat &gt; init &lt;&lt; EOF
#!/bin/busybox sh
/bin/busybox --install /bin
exec sh
EOF
chmod +x init
)
</pre>



</div>
<p>we fetch a <code>busybox</code> binary from the website, make it executable, and then create a new init file that utilizes it.
the first line is important - the kernel sees <code>#!</code> (called the 'shebang') and knows that what comes next is a command which can interpret the remainder of the file.
then, <code>/bin/busybox --install /bin</code> creates hard links to <code>/bin/busybox</code> for every 'applet' in the <code>/bin</code> directory.
one such link is <code>/bin/sh</code>, which we make immediate use of: the next, and final, action of our init script is to run <code>exec sh</code>.
<code>exec</code> replaces the current process with the new process spawned by running the given command, which is why it comes at the end - nothing written after <code>exec</code> would be run.
while not strictly necessary in our toy case (if we directly ran <code>sh</code> it would be spawned as a child process; on exit it would return to the parent process, which would find no further commands to run and would itself exit) it is best practice, so better to get used to it now.

</pre>



</div>
<p>we now rebuild our kernel to use the new initramfs configuration file, copy the resulting image to the initramfs directory, and create a new disk image from it.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">

</div>
<p>now we finally have a useful system.
feel free to play around with <code>busybox</code> and its 'applets' before continuing - it's not uncommon to find in the wild, especially on things like rescue disks and containers, so it would not be a bad use of your time to become familiar with it.
exercise for the reader: using what you have learned so far, can you create a bootable usb with this custom kernel and run it on your hardware?
answers on a postcard, please.
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:9"><div class="section"><h4>stage7 - switch_root</h4></a>
<p>at this point you may wonder what's left to do - we've booted a custom linux kernel image from disk using UEFI, and we get a shell with a suite of useful applications available.
remember that we are still just running the initramfs, whose job is to boot up the real OS on the root filesystem.
we could certainly try building a root filesystem for a "real" linux system and have our initramfs load it, but that starts to encroach on Linux From Scratch's territory, so isn't really appropriate for this primer.
lucky for us then that we already have a rootfs disk image ready to go.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{exec switch_root <a href="LFSp.html#1:9">9</a>}</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">
cat &gt; linux/usr/initramfs_list &lt;&lt; EOF
dir /proc 755 0 0
dir /sys 755 0 0

</div>
<p>new here are the directories <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code>, which are required in order to mount <code>/dev/sdb</code>, the major and minor numbers of which we used the previously mentioned <code>devices.txt</code> to find.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<span class="codeblock_name">{exec switch_root <a href="LFSp.html#1:9">9</a>} +=</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">

mkdir /mnt
mount /dev/sdb /mnt
exec switch_root /mnt /sbin/init
EOF
chmod +x init
)
</pre>



</div>
<p>to access <code>/dev/sdb</code> we need to mount it; we create a directory <code>/mnt</code> to use as a mount point.
the key change here is that rather than having <code>init</code> execute <code>sh</code> as its final step, we run a program called <code>switch_root</code>.
this changes our root directory to <code>/mnt</code>, discards the initramfs (freeing the memory it had been using), and executes <code>/sbin/init</code>

<p>and we boot for the final time:

</pre>



</div>
<p>exercise for the reader: create one disk image containing both our initramfs and rootfs and get it running.
</p>
<p>that's as far as this primer can take you - i hope that it was of some use.
those so inclined can continue to part 2 in the series, <a href=LFSc.html>LFS: a companion</a>
