A PowerShell script that automatically triages issues in Redmine.

Rules for handling Issues are defined in a YAML file. Each Rule consists of a Filter,
an Action, and optionally a Function. Issues assigned to a given ID are pulled from the
given Redmine server and iterated over. Each iteration checks the Issue against the list
of Rules. If the Issue matches one of the Rules' Filter, that Rule's Action is applied to
the Issue. If a Function is present, the corresponding PowerShell function is executed.

Internal helper functions are stored in Functions/Private.
Functions to be invoked by Rules are stored in Functions/Public. A template is available.
